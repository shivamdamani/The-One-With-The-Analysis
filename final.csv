phoebe,"Wait, does he eat chalk?",1,1
phoebe,"Just, Because, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!",1,1

joey,And you never knew she was a lesbian...,1,1
ross,"No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?",1,1

ross,"I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.",1,1
monica,"Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3",1,1

rachel,"Hi, sure!",1,1
ross,Hi.,1,1
monica,"So you want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?",1,1
rachel,"Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that is when it hit me",1,1
monica,Who wasn't invited to the wedding.,1,1
rachel,"Ooh, I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue…",1,1
monica,"Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.",1,1
chandler,Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!,1,1
ross,I'll have whatever Christine is having.,1,1
rachel,"Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!",1,1

rachel,"C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you are a shoe! you are a shoe, you are a shoe, you are a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't want to be a shoe? What if I want to be a- a purse, you know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!",1,1
ross,You can see where he'd have trouble.,1,1
rachel,"Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.",1,1
monica,"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...",1,1
rachel,"Well, maybe that is my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!",1,1
monica,"Just breathe, breathe.. that is it. Just try to think of nice calm things...",1,1
phoebe,"Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...",1,1
rachel,I'm all better now.,1,1
phoebe,I helped!,1,1
monica,"Okay, look, this is probably for the best, you know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.",1,1
joey,"And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.",1,1
monica,"Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!",1,1

monica,Yes!,1,1
chandler,"Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.",1,1
monica,"Rach, wait, I can cancel...",1,1
rachel,"Please, no, go, that'd be fine!",1,1
monica,"Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?",1,1
ross,That'd be good...,1,1
monica,Really?,1,1
ross,"No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!",1,1
phoebe,"What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?",1,1
monica,"Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.",1,1
all,Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!,1,1
chandler,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?",1,1

ross,A wandering?,1,1
monica,"Change!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.",1,1
phoebe,"Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.",1,1
joey,"Hey, Paul!",1,1
paul,Yeah?,1,1
joey,"Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.",1,1
monica,"Shut up, Joey!",1,1
ross,"So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?",1,1
rachel,"Well, I was kind of supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!",1,1
ross,"Right, you are not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.",1,1
chandler,"Yes, and we're very excited about it.",1,1
rachel,"Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just going to hang out here tonight.  It's been kind of a long day.",1,1
ross,"Okay, sure.",1,1
joey,"Hey Pheebs, you want to help?",1,1
phoebe,"Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.",1,1
phoebe,"Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la-  Thank you.  La-la-la-la...oh!",1,1
ross,"I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.",1,1
joey,I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.,1,1
chandler,It's a beautiful thing.,1,1
joey,What's this?,1,1
chandler,I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.,1,1
joey,Which goes where?,1,1
chandler,I have no idea.,1,1
joey,Done with the bookcase!,1,1
chandler,All finished!,1,1
ross,"This was Carol's favourite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.",1,1
joey,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you are going to start with that stuff we're out of here.",1,1
chandler,"Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.",1,1
joey,"Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?",1,1
ross,You guys.,1,1
chandler,"Oh, God.",1,1
joey,You got screwed.,1,1
chandler,Oh my God!,1,1
monica,Oh my God!,1,1
paul,"I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?",1,1
monica,"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?",1,1
paul,"Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-",1,1
monica,#NAME?,1,1
paul,"that is one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.",1,1
monica,"You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favourite bath towel.",1,1
paul,"Ooh, steer clear of you.",1,1
monica,that is right.,1,1
rachel,"Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...",1,1
ross,I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!,1,1
joey,Shut up!,1,1
chandler,You must stop!,1,1
ross,That only took me an hour.,1,1
chandler,"Look, Ross, you got to understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!",1,1
ross,"You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, you know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that is it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...",1,1
joey,"What are you talking about? 'One woman'? that is like saying there's only one flavour of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavours out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get them with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!",1,1
ross,I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.,1,1
chandler,Stay out of my freezer!,1,1
paul,"Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...",1,1
monica,"What?..... What, you want to spell it out with noodles?",1,1
paul,"No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.",1,1
monica,"Oh, so there is going to be a fifth date?",1,1
paul,Isn't there?,1,1
monica,"Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you going to say?",1,1
paul,"Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform.  ...Sexually.",1,1
monica,"Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...",1,1
paul,It's okay...,1,1
monica,I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?,1,1
paul,Two years.,1,1
monica,Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!,1,1
paul,"So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?",1,1
monica,"...Yeah. Yeah, I do.",1,1
priest on tv,"We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.",1,1
rachel,Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! that is the difference!,1,1
ross,"Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?",1,1
joey,"Great story!  But, I uh, I got to go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man,",1,1
chandler,"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.",1,1
joey,Right.  Thanks.  It's June.  I'm out of here.,1,1
ross,"You know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I going to ask?",1,1
rachel,"Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.",1,1
chandler,That is amazing.,1,1
joey,Congratulations.,1,1
rachel,"You know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.",1,1
chandler,"If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.",1,1
joey,"Listen, while you are on a roll, if you feel like you got to make like a Western omelette or something...  Although actually I'm really not that hungry...",1,1
monica,"Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.",1,1
all,Morning. Good morning.,1,1
paul,Morning.,1,1
joey,"Morning, Paul.",1,1
rachel,"Hello, Paul.",1,1
chandler,"Hi, Paul, is it?",1,1
paul,Thank you!  Thank you so much!,1,1
monica,Stop!,1,1
paul,"No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.",1,1
monica,We'll talk later.,1,1
paul,Yeah.  Thank you.,1,1
joey,That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?,1,1
monica,"Shut up, and put my table back.",1,1
all,Okay!,1,1
chandler,"All right, kids, I got to get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...",1,1
rachel,"So, like, you guys all have jobs?",1,1
monica,"Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that is how we buy stuff.",1,1
joey,"Yeah, I'm an actor.",1,1
rachel,Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?,1,1
joey,I doubt it. Mostly regional work.,1,1
monica,"Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theatre in the park.",1,1
joey,"Look, it was a job all right?",1,1
chandler,"'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'",1,1
joey,I will not take this abuse.,1,1
chandler,"you are right, I'm sorry.  ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...""",1,1
joey,"You should both know, that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler?",1,1
monica,So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.,1,1
rachel,I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.,1,1
monica,"I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?",1,1
rachel,"Oh, yeah.",1,1
monica,"Well, it's like that. With feelings.",1,1
rachel,Oh wow. Are you in trouble.,1,1
monica,Big time!,1,1
rachel,Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.,1,1
monica,"I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just going to get up and go to work.",1,1
rachel,"Oh, look, wish me luck!",1,1
monica,What for?,1,1
rachel,I'm going to go get one of those  job things.,1,1
frannie,"Hey, Monica!",1,1
monica,"Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?",1,1
frannie,"You had sex, didn't you?",1,1
monica,How do you do that?,1,1
frannie,"Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you are having sex!  So? Who?",1,1
monica,You know Paul?,1,1
frannie,"Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.",1,1
monica,You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?,1,1
frannie,"Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. You know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.",1,1
joey,Of course it was a line!,1,1
monica,"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?",1,1
ross,I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.,1,1
monica,I hate men!  I hate men!,1,1
phoebe,"Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.",1,1
monica,Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?,1,1
phoebe,"All right, come here, give me your feet.",1,1
monica,"I just thought he was nice, you know?",1,1
joey,I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!,1,1
rachel,Guess what?,1,1
ross,You got a job?,1,1
rachel,Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.,1,1
chandler,And yet you are surprisingly upbeat.,1,1
rachel,"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!",1,1
chandler,"Oh, how well you know me...",1,1
rachel,"They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!",1,1
monica,How'd you pay for them?,1,1
rachel,"Uh, credit card.",1,1
monica,And who pays for that?,1,1
rachel,Um... my... father.,1,1
rachel,"Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.",1,1
monica,"C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.",1,1
rachel,I know that. that is why I was getting married.,1,1
phoebe,"Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.",1,1
rachel,Thank you.,1,1
phoebe,"you are welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.",1,1
ross,The word you are looking for is 'Anyway'...,1,1
monica,"All right, you ready?",1,1
rachel,"No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!",1,1
monica,"You can, I know you can!",1,1
rachel,I don't think so.,1,1
ross,"Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!",1,1
ross,"C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...",1,1
all,"Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...",1,1
rachel,You know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kind of like a symbolic gesture...,1,1
monica,Rachel!  That was a library card!,1,1
all,"Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..",1,1
chandler,"You know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.",1,1
monica,Welcome to the real world! It sucks. you are going to love it!,1,1
monica,"Well, that is it  You going to crash on the couch?",1,1
ross,"No. No, I got to go home sometime.",1,1
monica,You be okay?,1,1
ross,Yeah.,1,1
rachel,"Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?",1,1

rachel,"No, you have it, really, I don't want it-",1,1
ross,Split it?,1,1
rachel,Okay.,1,1
ross,"Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.",1,1
rachel,I knew.,1,1
ross,You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.,1,1
rachel,I did.,1,1
ross,"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?",1,1
rachel,"Yeah, maybe...",1,1
ross,"Okay... okay, maybe I will...",1,1
rachel,Goodnight.,1,1
ross,Goodnight.,1,1
monica,"See you .... Wait wait, what's with you?",1,1
ross,I just grabbed a spoon.,1,1
joey,I can't believe what I'm hearing here.,1,1
phoebe,I can't believe what I'm hearing here...,1,1
monica,What? I-I said you had a-,1,1
phoebe,What I said you had...,1,1
monica,Would you stop?,1,1
phoebe,"Oh, was I doing it again?",1,1
all,Yes!,1,1
monica,"I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.",1,1
joey,"Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit you.",1,1
ross,There's an image.,1,1
rachel,Would anybody like more coffee?,1,1

joey,"Yeah, right!.......You serious?",1,2
phoebe,"Oh, yeah!",1,2
rachel,Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.,1,2
monica,Absolutely.,1,2
chandler,"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, you know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.",1,2
ross,"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that is not why we bought the ticket.",1,2
chandler,"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, you know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.",1,2
rachel,"Yeah, well, word of advice",1,2
joey,....Are we still talking about sex?,1,2
ross,"No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?",1,2
marsha,"Well, she has issues.",1,2
ross,Does she.,1,2
marsha,"He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!",1,2
ross,"Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close.' See?",1,2
marsha,"Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?",1,2
ross,No. No.,1,2
marsha,"Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!",1,2

carol,A lesbian?,1,2
ross,"Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?",1,2
carol,"Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-",1,2
ross,"Why- why are you here, Carol?",1,2
carol,I'm pregnant.,1,2
ross,Pregnant?!,1,2
chandler,"Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.",1,2
phoebe,...Then I've already seen this one!,1,2
monica,Are you through with that?,1,2
joey,"Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.",1,2
monica,Whose little ball of paper is this?!,1,2
chandler,"Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.",1,2
phoebe,"She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!",1,2
monica,"Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't want to give them any more ammunition than they already have.",1,2
chandler,"Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.",1,2
phoebe,"Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you are scaring me. I mean, you are like, you are like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.",1,2
joey,"Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.",1,2
monica,"that is because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. You see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.",1,2
chandler,"Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!",1,2
monica,What?,1,2
chandler,Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!,1,2
all,Eeaagh!,1,2
rachel,Has anybody seen my engagement ring?,1,2
phoebe,"Yeah, it's beautiful.",1,2
rachel,"Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....",1,2
phoebe,"No, look, don't touch that!",1,2
rachel,"Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm going to have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...",1,2
monica,"Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!",1,2
chandler and joey,Oh! Yeah!,1,2
joey,"Alright, when did you have it on last?",1,2
phoebe,Doy! Probably right before she lost it!,1,2
chandler,You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...,1,2
rachel,"I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...",1,2
chandler,...Dinah?,1,2
rachel,"ohhh, don't be mad...",1,2
monica,You didn't.,1,2
rachel,"Oh, I am sorry...",1,2
monica,I gave you one job!,1,2
rachel,"Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!",1,2
chandler,"Now, Monica, you know that is not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...",1,2
monica,I just... can't do it.,1,2
chandler,Boys? We're going in.,1,2
ross,.....Hi.,1,2
monica,Wow. That is not a happy hi.,1,2
ross,Carol's pregnant.,1,2
phoebe,Ooh! I found it!,1,2
monica,W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...,1,2
ross,"Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.",1,2
chandler,"Kind of puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?",1,2
rachel,"Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?",1,2
ross,"Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.",1,2
phoebe,She is so great! I miss her.,1,2
monica,What does she mean by 'involved'?,1,2
chandler,"I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.",1,2
ross,"Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.",1,2
rachel,So what are you going to do?,1,2
ross,"I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still going to be a father.",1,2
joey,".....Well, this is still ruined, right?",1,2
mrs. geller,"Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is going to call you.  Mmm! What's that curry taste?",1,2
monica,Curry.,1,2
mrs. geller,Mmmm!,1,2
ross,"I- I think they're great! I, I really do.",1,2
mr. geller,"Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?",1,2
mrs. geller,They all had a thing for him.,1,2
ross,"Aw, Mom...",1,2
monica,"I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?",1,2
mrs. geller,"Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-",1,2
monica,"No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.",1,2
mrs. geller,"Well, they don't have to know that...",1,2
monica,"Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?",1,2
ross,Yeah.,1,2
mrs. geller,"Oh, we're having spaghetti! that is.... easy.",1,2
monica,"I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.",1,2
mrs. geller,"What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.",1,2
mr. geller,I'm not going to tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!,1,2
mrs. geller,"Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...",1,2
monica,What's that supposed to mean?,1,2
mrs. geller,Nothing! It's an expression.,1,2
monica,No it's not.,1,2
mr. geller,"Don't listen to your mother. you are independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...",1,2
mr. geller,"Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.",1,2
mr. geller,"...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.",1,2
monica,"So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?",1,2
ross,"Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.",1,2
mrs. geller,And you knew about this?!,1,2
joey,"Your folks are really that bad, huh?",1,2
ross,"Well, you know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.",1,2
monica,"Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours.",1,2
ross,Must pee.,1,2
phoebe,"You know, it's even worse when you are twins.",1,2
rachel,you are twins?,1,2
phoebe,"Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.",1,2
chandler,What does she do?,1,2
phoebe,She's a waitress.,1,2
rachel,"All right, you guys, I kind of got to clean up now.",1,2
monica,"Chandler, you are an only child, right? You don't have any of this.",1,2
chandler,"Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.",1,2
rachel,"The lights, please..",1,2
ross,...How long was I in there?,1,2
rachel,I'm just cleaning up.,1,2
ross,Do you.. uh.. Do you need any help?,1,2
rachel,"Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!",1,2
ross,"Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?",1,2
rachel,Oh.. a little..,1,2
ross,Mm-hmm..,1,2
rachel,A lot.,1,2
ross,Mm.,1,2
rachel,"So, got any advice? You know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?",1,2
ross,"Well, you may want to steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's going to be this, this broken shell of a man, you know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, you know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...",1,2
rachel,"Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?",1,2
ross,Got me.,1,2
rachel,Remember when we were in high school together?,1,2
ross,Yeah.,1,2
rachel,"I mean, didn't you think you were just going to meet someone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross?",1,2
ross,"Yes, yes!",1,2
rachel,"Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..",1,2
ross,Me either...,1,2
ross,"Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.",1,2
susan,Hi.,1,2
carol,"Ross, you remember Susan.",1,2
ross,How could I forget?,1,2
susan,Ross.,1,2
ross,"Hello, Susan.  Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?",1,2
carol,Dr. Oberman.,1,2
ross,..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-,1,2
susan,She.,1,2
ross,#NAME?,1,2
carol,"Yes, and she's very supportive.",1,2
ross,"Okay, that is great.  No, I'm- Oh.",1,2
carol,Thanks.,1,2
ross,"Quack, quack..",1,2
carol,Ross? That opens my cervix.,1,2
rachel,Barry?,1,2
barry,C'mon in.,1,2
rachel,Are you sure?,1,2
barry,"Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's going to be here for hours.",1,2
robbie,Huh?!,1,2
barry,"So, how you doin?",1,2
rachel,I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!,1,2
barry,"Yeah, well..",1,2
bernice,"Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.",1,2
barry,Be right there.  Be back in a sec.,1,2
rachel,I dumped him.,1,2
robbie,Okay.,1,2
ross,"So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this going to work? You know, with us? You know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?",1,2
carol,Give me a 'for instance'.,1,2
ross,"Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?",1,2
carol,Marlon-,1,2
ross,Marlon?!,1,2
carol,"-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.",1,2
ross,...As in Mouse?,1,2
carol,As in my grandmother.,1,2
ross,"Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?",1,2
carol,Julia..,1,2
susan,We agreed on Minnie.,1,2
ross,"It is funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?",1,2
barry,Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?,1,2
rachel,"Oh, not much. I-I got a job.",1,2
barry,"Oh, that is great.",1,2
rachel,Why are- why are you so tanned?,1,2
barry,"Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.",1,2
rachel,Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?,1,2
barry,"No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.",1,2
robbie,Me?!,1,2
barry,No!  I went with Mindy.,1,2
rachel,"Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!",1,2
barry,"Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.",1,2
rachel,"Oh! Well, um..  You've got plugs!",1,2
barry,Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.,1,2
rachel,And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!,1,2
barry,"Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.",1,2
rachel,Okay..,1,2
barry,"See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.",1,2
rachel,Wow.,1,2
barry,"You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.",1,2
rachel,What?,1,2
robbie,Me.,1,2
rachel,"Anyway, um,  I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.",1,2
barry,"Well, thank you for giving it back.",1,2
robbie,Hello?!,1,2
susan,"Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?",1,2
ross,Helen Geller? I don't think so.,1,2
carol,Hello? It's not going to be Helen Geller.,1,2
ross,Thank you!,1,2
carol,"No, I mean it's not Geller.",1,2
ross,"What, it's going to be Helen Willick?",1,2
carol,"No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.",1,2
ross,"Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?",1,2
susan,It's my baby too.,1,2
ross,"Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.",1,2
susan,"Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!",1,2
carol,"All right, you two, stop it!",1,2
ross,"No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.",1,2
carol,Ross. you are not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller?Because I think that borders on child abuse.,1,2
ross,"Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.",1,2
susan,"Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's going to say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!",1,2
ross,"My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way-you know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-",1,2
dr. oberman,Knock knock! How are we today? Any nausea?,1,2
all,Yeah. Yeah. A little.,1,2
dr. oberman,"Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing.  Uh, lie back..",1,2
ross,"You- uh-you know what, I'm going to go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.",1,2
ross,Oh my God.,1,2
susan,Look at that.,1,2
carol,I know.,1,2
ross,Well? Isn't that amazing?,1,2
joey,What are we supposed to be seeing here?,1,2
chandler,"I don't know, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.",1,2
phoebe,"You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kind of looks like an old potato.",1,2
ross,"Then don't do that, alright?",1,2
phoebe,Okay!,1,2
ross,Monica. what do you think?,1,2
monica,Mm-hmm.,1,2
ross,Wh- are you welling up?,1,2
monica,No.,1,2
ross,"You are, you are welling up.",1,2
monica,Am not!,1,2
ross,you are going to be an aunt.,1,2
monica,Oh shut up!,1,2
rachel,"Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, you know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.   Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.",1,2
phoebe,Hi guys!,1,3
all,"Hey, Pheebs! Hi!",1,3
ross,"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?",1,3
phoebe,"Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'",1,3
all,OH. Ouch.,1,3
rachel,"What? He said 'we should do it again', that is good, right?",1,3
monica,"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.",1,3
rachel,Since when?,1,3
joey,"Since always. It's like dating language. You know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.",1,3
chandler,Or 'you are such a nice guy' means 'I'm going to be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.,1,3
phoebe,"Or, or, you know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.",1,3
rachel,And everybody knows this?,1,3
joey,Yeah. Cushions the blow.,1,3
chandler,"Yeah, it's like when you are a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.",1,3
ross,"that is funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.",1,3
monica,"Uh, Ross.",1,3
ross,"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!",1,3
chandler,"""So how does it feel knowing you are about to die?""",1,3
joey,"""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.""",1,3
chandler,"Hey, that was really good!",1,3
joey,Thanks! Let's keep going.,1,3
chandler,"Okay. ""So. what do you want from me, Damone, huh?""",1,3
joey,"""I just want to go back to my cell. Because in my cell, I can smoke.""",1,3
chandler,"""Smoke away.""",1,3
chandler,I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.,1,3
joey,What?,1,3
chandler,Relax your hand!,1,3
chandler,Not so much!,1,3
joey,Whoa!,1,3
chandler,Hey!,1,3
joey,Hey!,1,3
chandler,"Alright, now try taking a puff.",1,3
chandler,Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.,1,3
joey,"No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.",1,3
chandler,"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you want to get this part, or not? Here.",1,3
chandler,"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that is been missing from your hand. When you are holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.",1,3
joey,Miss it?,1,3
chandler,"Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke.  Oh.. my.. God.",1,3
monica,"No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.",1,3
joey,that is ridiculous!,1,3
ross,Can I use.. either thumb?,1,3
rachel,"Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!  Decaf cappuccino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!",1,3
all,"Yeah. Yeah, excellent.",1,3
rachel,Good for me!,1,3
joey,"Y'okay, Phoebe?",1,3
phoebe,"Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.",1,3
monica,What did they do to you?,1,3
phoebe,"It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-",1,3
ross,Easy.,1,3
phoebe,- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.,1,3
chandler,"Oh, Satan's minions at work again...",1,3
phoebe,"Yes, Because now I have to go down there, and deal with them.",1,3
joey,What are you talking about? Keep it!,1,3
phoebe,"It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.",1,3
rachel,"Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!",1,3
phoebe,"Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...",1,3
monica,We're with you. We got it.,1,3
phoebe,Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.,1,3
rachel,"Chandler, what are you doing?",1,3
monica,Hey. what do you doing?,1,3
all,"Oh! Oh, God!",1,3
ross,What is this?!,1,3
chandler,"I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.",1,3
phoebe,"Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!",1,3
chandler,And this- is my reward!,1,3
ross,"Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.",1,3
chandler,"Okay, so this time I won't quit!",1,3
all,oh! Put it out!,1,3
chandler,"All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.",1,3
phoebe,"Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!",1,3
monica,"Alright. I'm going to go change, I've got a date.",1,3
rachel,This Alan again? How's it going'?,1,3
monica,"It is going pretty good,you know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.",1,3
joey,So when do we get to meet the guy?,1,3
monica,"Let's see, today's Monday... Never.",1,3
all,"Oh, come on! Come on!",1,3
monica,No. Not after what happened with Steve.,1,3
chandler,What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.,1,3
monica,"Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.",1,3
rachel,"Well, then can we meet him?",1,3
monica,Nope. Schhorry.,1,3
monica,"I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.",1,3
paula,"Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you",1,3
monica,"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.",1,3
paula,"Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..",1,3
joey,"Let it go, Ross.",1,3
ross,"Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.",1,3
monica,Do you all promise?,1,3
all,Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!,1,3
monica,Chandler? Do you promise to be good?,1,3
joey,"You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!",1,3
ross,"Hey, Pheebs.",1,3
phoebe,"'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!",1,3
rachel,What bank is this?,1,3
monica,Hey. It's him.  Who is it?,1,3
alan,It's Alan.,1,3
joey,Chandler! He's here!,1,3
monica,"Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.",1,3
monica,"Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.",1,3
alan,Hi.,1,3
all,"Hi, Alan.",1,3
alan,I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!,1,3
monica,"Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow.  Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's going to take the first shot, hmm?",1,3
monica,C'mon!,1,3
ross,"...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.",1,3
all,Loved him! Yeah! He's great!,1,3
monica,Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?,1,3
all,Yeah!,1,3
rachel,And did you notice...?,1,3
ross chandler joey,Yeah.,1,3
joey,Know what was great? The way his smile was kind of crooked.,1,3
phoebe,"Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!",1,3
ross,...What shoe?,1,3
phoebe,"From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'",1,3
ross,...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.,1,3
rachel,"What future boyfriends? No no, I th- I think this could be, you know, it.",1,3
monica,Really!,1,3
chandler,"Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm going to be doing that at parties, right?",1,3
ross,"You know what I like most about him, though?",1,3
all,What?,1,3
ross,The way he makes me feel about myself.,1,3
all,Yeah...,1,3
monica,Hi.. how was the game?,1,3
ross,Well..,1,3
all,WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!,1,3
monica,Fantastic! I have one question,1,3
joey,Alan.,1,3
ross,"He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...",1,3
rachel,"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.",1,3
chandler,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..",1,3
monica,Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..,1,3
ross,What?,1,3
monica,"..I don't know, a little too Alan?",1,3
rachel,"Well, no. that is impossible. You can never be too Alan.",1,3
ross,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.",1,3
chandler,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.,1,3
phoebe,"Hey, Lizzie.",1,3
lizzie,"Hey, Weird Girl.",1,3
phoebe,I brought you alphabet soup.,1,3
lizzie,Did you pick out the vowels?,1,3
phoebe,"Yes. But I left in the Ys. Because, you know, ""sometimes y"". Uh, I also have something else for you.",1,3
lizzie,Saltines?,1,3
phoebe,"No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?",1,3
lizzie,"What?  Oh my God, there's really money in here.",1,3
phoebe,I know.,1,3
lizzie,"Weird Girl, what are you doing?",1,3
phoebe,"No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.",1,3
lizzie,"No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.",1,3
phoebe,"Oh, that is fine, no.",1,3
lizzie,Would you like my tin-foil hat?,1,3
phoebe,"No. Because you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.",1,3

phoebe,Huh!,1,3
ross,A thumb?!,1,3
all,Ew!,1,3
phoebe,"I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!",1,3
chandler,"Well, maybe it's a contest, you know? Like, collect all five?",1,3
phoebe,"Does, um, anyone want to see?",1,3
all,Nook!,1,3
all,"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",1,3
rachel,It's worse than the thumb!,1,3
chandler,"Hey, this is so unfair!",1,3
monica,"Oh, why is it unfair?",1,3
chandler,"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?",1,3
joey,...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?,1,3
rachel,"Well, I-I could live without it.",1,3
joey,"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?",1,3
ross,"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.",1,3
joey,"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?",1,3
ross,"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.",1,3
rachel,"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work.",1,3
phoebe,"Yeah, because otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.",1,3
rachel,"Oh-ho-hoooh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.",1,3
monica,Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?,1,3
paula,No.,1,3
monica,"Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.",1,3
paula,"Wait wait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!",1,3
monica,"Can you believe it? ...You know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.",1,3
paula,"Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that is how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!",1,3
monica,I know.. it's going to be really hard.,1,3
paula,"Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.",1,3
monica,"No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.",1,3
joey,Do you have any respect for your body?,1,3
ross,Don't you realise what you are-you are doing to yourself?,1,3
chandler,"Hey, you know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.",1,3
rachel,"Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.",1,3
chandler,"Really? He does?  Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that is true,.. Gee, you know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!",1,3
rachel,"God, he's good.",1,3
ross,If only he were a woman.,1,3
rachel,Yeah.,1,3
chandler,"Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.",1,3
ross,Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.,1,3
monica,Hey. Where's Joey?,1,3
chandler,"Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?",1,3
rachel,I think he's across the hall.,1,3
monica,Thanks.,1,3
ross,There you go.,1,3
chandler,"Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.",1,3
ross,"Hey Pheebs, you going to have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?",1,3
phoebe,Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?,1,3
ross,"Hey, I might!",1,3
phoebe,"Sorry. ..You know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.",1,3
all,you are kidding. Oh my God.,1,3
phoebe,"And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!",1,3
joey,What's going on?,1,3
monica,Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.,1,3
joey,Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..,1,3
rachel,"Uh, Joey..",1,3
joey,"Oh, God!",1,3
monica,Okay..,1,3
all,Oh! That was Lambchop!,1,3
monica,"Please, guys, we have to talk.",1,3
phoebe,"Wait, wait, I'm getting a Deja vu...no, I'm not.",1,3
monica,"Alright, we have to talk.",1,3
phoebe,There it is!,1,3
monica,"Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.",1,3
ross,Is there somebody else?,1,3
monica,"No, no no no no.. it's just.. things change. People change.",1,3
rachel,We didn't change..,1,3
joey,So that is it? It's over? Just like that?,1,3
phoebe,"You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-",1,3
monica,"Look, I- I could go on pretending-",1,3
joey,Okay!,1,3
monica,"-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!",1,3
ross,"Who-who wants fair? You know, I just want things back. You know, the way they were.",1,3
monica,I'm sorry..,1,3
chandler,"Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!",1,3
rachel,"I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-",1,3
monica,I'll meet someone else. There'll be other Alans.,1,3
all,"Oh, yeah! Right!",1,3
monica,Are you guys going to be okay?,1,3
ross,"Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just going to need a little time.",1,3
monica,I understand.,1,3
alan,Wow.,1,3
monica,"I'm, I'm really sorry.",1,3
alan,"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I got to tell you, I am a little relieved.",1,3
monica,Relieved?,1,3
alan,"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.",1,3
rachel,Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.,1,3
ross,Yeah. He could row like a Viking.,1,3
monica,Hi.,1,3
all,Mm.,1,3
ross,So how'd it go?,1,3
monica,"Oh, you know..",1,3
phoebe,Did he mention us?,1,3
monica,He said he's really going to miss you guys.,1,3
ross,"You had a rough day, huh.. come here.",1,3
chandler,...that is it. I'm getting cigarettes.,1,3
all,No no no!,1,3
chandler,"I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've got to smoke! I've got to have the smoke!",1,3
phoebe,If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!,1,3
chandler,"Yeah, alright.",1,3
monica,Alright. Phoebe?,1,4
phoebe,"Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!",1,4
ross,"Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?",1,4
chandler,"Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.",1,4

all,"Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.",1,4
monica,"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?",1,4
joey,Probably kill myself!,1,4
monica,..Excuse me?,1,4
joey,"Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!",1,4
ross,"Joey, uh- OMnipotent.",1,4
joey,"You are? Ross, I'm sorry..",1,4

monica,What's going on with you?,1,4
phoebe,I got no sleep last night!,1,4
ross,Why?,1,4
phoebe,"My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!",1,4
monica,"Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.",1,4
phoebe,Thanks.,1,4
joey,"...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.",1,4

ross,oh.,1,4
joey,What's wrong with the twentieth?,1,4
chandler,Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?,1,4
ross,"Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship.  Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just going to go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.",1,4

phoebe,"I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?",1,4
rachel,"God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally——not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.",1,4

monica,"That is the unusual activity. Look, they just want to see if you are okay.",1,4
rachel,"They want to know if I'm okay. Okay.. they want to know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?",1,4

chandler,"Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.",1,4
rachel,"Nook!   Hello?  Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.  Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.",1,4
ross,Green. To the green.,1,4
rachel,I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.,1,4
chandler,"To the left, to the left- aww!",1,4
rachel,oh... I'm fine.,1,4
monica,Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.,1,5
ross,"Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little manoeuvre, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?",1,5
rachel,Come on! You guys can pee standing up.,1,5
chandler,"We can? All right, I'm trying' that.",1,5
joey,"Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.",1,5
phoebe,"Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.",1,5
ross,Multiple orgasms!,1,5
chandler,"So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!",1,5
joey,"No plans, huh?",1,5
chandler,Not a one.,1,5
ross,"Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?",1,5
chandler,"Oh, right, right, shut up.",1,5
monica,"Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just got to do it.",1,5
chandler,"No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you are sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.",1,5
joey,"Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.",1,5
phoebe,"You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.",1,5
chandler,"Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're ganging' up on her.",1,5
phoebe,"No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.",1,5
ross,Tony?,1,5
monica,"Oh, you are breaking up with Tony?",1,5
phoebe,"Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.",1,5
rachel,Does anybody want anything else?,1,5
ross,"Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.",1,5
phoebe,What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?,1,5
rachel,It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.,1,5
ross,"That guy, he burns me up.",1,5
rachel,"Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.",1,5
chandler,"Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.",1,5
monica,"Did he give you that whole ""you are-not-up-to-this"" thing again?",1,5
rachel,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own"".",1,5
phoebe,"Uh-huh, uh-huh.",1,5
angela,"Hi, Joey.",1,5
joey,"My god, Angela.",1,5
monica,"Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.",1,5
phoebe,Are you going to go over there?,1,5
joey,"No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't want to seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey, Angela.",1,5
angela,Joey.,1,5
joey,You look good.,1,5
angela,that is because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.,1,5
joey,You don't say.,1,5
ross,"So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?",1,5
rachel,"Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.",1,5
ross,"Oh, you uh, you want to hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?",1,5
rachel,Who?,1,5
ross,"Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?",1,5
rachel,Don't you have a laundry room in your building?,1,5
ross,"Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're going' in fine, but they're coming' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?",1,5
rachel,Sure.,1,5
angela,Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.,1,5
joey,Bob? Who the hell's Bob?,1,5
angela,"Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...",1,5
joey,"Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.",1,5
angela,"Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?",1,5
joey,What?,1,5
angela,We're just friends.,1,5
joey,"Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?",1,5
angela,What four of us?,1,5
joey,"You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.",1,5
joey,"Monica, I'm telling' you, this guy is perfect for you.",1,5
monica,Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.,1,5
joey,"Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...",1,5
monica,"Oh, god help us.",1,5
joey,What?,1,5
monica,Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Ew!,1,5
joey,"Ew! Look, I'm asking a favour here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.",1,5
monica,What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.,1,5
joey,"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",1,5
ross,"Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just going to be me and Rachel.",1,5
chandler,"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?",1,5
ross,It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.,1,5
chandler,"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. you are going on a date.",1,5
ross,Nuh-uh.,1,5
chandler,Yuh-huh.,1,5
ross,"So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?",1,5
chandler,"Well, you may want to rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's going to see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?",1,5
ross,No.,1,5
chandler,"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?",1,5
ross,"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kind of guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.",1,5
chandler,There you go.,1,5
monica,Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?,1,5
joey,Yep.,1,5
monica,Which?,1,5
joey,Which what?,1,5
monica,"You've never met Bob, have you?",1,5
joey,"No, but he's...",1,5
monica,"Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...",1,5
angela,"Hey, Joey.",1,5
monica,...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.,1,5
chandler,Where are they? Where are they?,1,5
phoebe,This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.,1,5
chandler,It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.,1,5
phoebe,"Ew, I don't want to do that.",1,5
chandler,Here we go.,1,5
phoebe,"Ok, have a good break-up.",1,5
chandler,"Hey, Janice.",1,5
janice,"Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.",1,5
chandler,"Hey, that is not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?",1,5
janice,"We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...",1,5
chandler,What?,1,5
janice,What?,1,5
chandler,What... did you get me there?,1,5
janice,I got you...these.,1,5
chandler,Bullwinkle socks. that is so sweet.,1,5
janice,"Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.",1,5
chandler,that is great.,1,5
chandler,"Well, I'm going to get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?",1,5
janice,"No, no, I'm still working on mine.",1,5
chandler,that is it?,1,5
phoebe,"Yeah, it was really hard.",1,5
chandler,"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.",1,5
phoebe,"Ok, you weren't there.",1,5
woman,"Comin' through. Move, move.",1,5
rachel,"Oh, 'excuse me. I was kind of using that machine.",1,5
woman,"Yeah, well, now you are kind of not.",1,5
rachel,But I saved it. I put my basket on top.,1,5
woman,"Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.",1,5
rachel,What?,1,5
woman,"No suds, no save. Ok?",1,5
ross,What's going' on?,1,5
rachel,"Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.",1,5
ross,Was your basket on top?,1,5
rachel,"Yeah, but, there were no suds.",1,5
ross,So?,1,5
rachel,"Well, you know, no suds, no save.",1,5
ross,"No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  that is my friend's machine.",1,5
woman,"Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.",1,5
ross,"Hey, hey, hey, that is not the rule and you know it.",1,5
ross,"All right, show's over. Nothing to see here.  Ok, let's do laundry.",1,5
rachel,That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.,1,5
ross,"Well, that is because you are such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.",1,5
rachel,What's that?,1,5
ross,"Uberfic. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.",1,5
ross,"Rach, do you uh, are you going to separate those?",1,5
rachel,"Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?",1,5
ross,"Rach, have you never done this before?",1,5
rachel,"Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.",1,5
ross,"Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you want to use one machine for all your whites, a whole other machine for colours, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.",1,5
rachel,"Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?",1,5
ross,"Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.",1,5
monica,"He is so cute.  So, where did you guys grow up?",1,5
angela,Brooklyn Heights.,1,5
bob,Cleveland.,1,5
monica,"How, how did that happen?",1,5
joey,Oh my god.,1,5
monica,What?,1,5
joey,I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.,1,5
joey,"So, you and Angela, huh?",1,5
bob,Yep. Pretty much.,1,5
joey,"you are a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.",1,5
bob,"Huh, I never really noticed.",1,5
joey,"Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.",1,5
bob,"Monica, Monica is great.",1,5
joey,"Yeah, but it's not going to last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.",1,5
monica,"I've got to tell you, Bob is terrific.",1,5
angela,"Yeah, isn't he?",1,5
monica,"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.",1,5
angela,You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.,1,5
monica,Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.,1,5
angela,Huh. that is nice.,1,5
phoebe,"Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.",1,5
chandler,"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.",1,5
janice,"All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.",1,5
rachel,"Ok, I know this is going to sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.",1,5
ross,"That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?  I'm sorry, that is all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.",1,5
rachel,What uh-oh?,1,5
ross,"Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing.  Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.",1,5
rachel,"Ross, what's the matter?",1,5
ross,"Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.",1,5
rachel,"Come on, show me.",1,5
ross,"All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kind of pink.",1,5
rachel,"Oh, everything's pink.",1,5
ross,"Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.",1,5
rachel,"Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm going to look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!",1,5
monica,"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?",1,5
monica,Oh my god.,1,5
joey,What?,1,5
monica,Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.,1,5
joey,"Come on, they're close.",1,5
monica,Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.,1,5
joey,"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.",1,5
monica,"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is it?",1,5
joey,"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...",1,5
monica,"Oh my god, what were you thinking?",1,5
joey,"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.",1,5
monica,Oh!,1,5
joey,Ow!,1,5
monica,I'm out of here.,1,5
joey,"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.",1,5
monica,Really?,1,5
joey,"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.",1,5
monica,"I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.",1,5
joey,"Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.",1,5
chandler,"Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the Bing, Bing, Bing. you are like the boom, boom, ... boom.",1,5
janice,Ow!,1,5
chandler,"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?",1,5
janice,"Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.",1,5
chandler,I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.,1,5
phoebe,Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?,1,5
chandler,"Oh, I don't know, a million?",1,5
phoebe,"Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.",1,5
chandler,I'm fine.,1,5
phoebe,All right.,1,5
chandler,I'm not fine. Here she comes.,1,5
phoebe,Wait here. Breathe.,1,5
chandler,How do you do that?,1,5
phoebe,It's like a gift.,1,5
chandler,We should always always break up together.,1,5
phoebe,"Oh, I'd like that.",1,5
ross,You got the clothes clean. Now that is the important part.,1,5
rachel,"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.",1,5
rachel,"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.",1,5
woman,"Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get out of my way.",1,5
rachel,"I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.",1,5
woman,"Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.",1,5
rachel,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!",1,5
woman,Let go!,1,5
rachel,"All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you are going to have to take me with it!",1,5
rachel,Yes! Did you see that?,1,5
ross,"You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.",1,5
rachel,I could not have done this without you.,1,5
ross,"Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine, I'm fine.",1,5
rachel,Are you sure?,1,5
ross,No.,1,5
rachel,"Oh, are you sure you are ok?",1,5
ross,Yeah.,1,5
rachel,Does it still hurt?,1,5
ross,Yeah.,1,5
phoebe,What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm going to do this.,1,5
monica,Hi.,1,5
phoebe,"Hey, how'd it go?",1,5
joey,Excellent.,1,5
monica,"We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.",1,5
ross,"What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.",1,5
monica,"Oh, I'm sorry.",1,5
rachel,Where's Chandler?,1,5
phoebe,"Oh, he needed some time to grieve.",1,5
chandler,I'm free! I'm free!,1,5
phoebe,That ought to do it.,1,5
rachel,"Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!",1,6
chandler,"You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...",1,6
phoebe,"The exclamation point in the title scares me. you know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!",1,6
ross,"Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.",1,6
joey,"Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.",1,6
rachel,God. I feel violated.,1,6
monica,"Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?",1,6
chandler,"Ross, ten o'clock.",1,6
ross,Is it? Feels like two.,1,6
chandler,"No, ten o'clock.",1,6
ross,What?,1,6
chandler,"There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!",1,6
ross,Oh. Hel-lo!,1,6
chandler,"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!",1,6
monica,"Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.",1,6
chandler,"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'",1,6
rachel,"Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!",1,6
chandler,"Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.",1,6
ross,He could never get a woman like that in a million years.,1,6
chandler,"Thank you, buddy.",1,6
phoebe,"Oh, oh, but you know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.",1,6
monica,You could do that!,1,6
chandler,You think?,1,6
all,Yeah!,1,6
chandler,"Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...",1,6
ross,Come on! Come on!,1,6
chandler,Here goes.,1,6
aurora,...Yes?,1,6
chandler,"Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh......hi.",1,6
aurora,"Yes, you said that.",1,6
chandler,"Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.",1,6
aurora,Chandler?,1,6
all,Hey! you are in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!,1,6
joey,What did you think?,1,6
all,...Hey! you are in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!,1,6
joey,"C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.",1,6
all,Saw your head. Saw your head.,1,6
chandler,"She said yes!! She said yes!!  Awful play, man. Woah.  Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way.  Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.",1,6
rachel,What is it?,1,6
joey,"The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they want to sign me!",1,6
phoebe,Based on this play? ...Based on this play!,1,6
chandler,"Hey, kids.",1,6
all,Hey.,1,6
phoebe,"No, Because this line is passion, and this is... just a line.",1,6
chandler,"Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.",1,6
monica,"Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?",1,6
chandler,It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...,1,6
aurora,"...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.",1,6
chandler,"Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.",1,6
chandler,We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.,1,6
aurora,...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.,1,6
chandler,"Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?",1,6
aurora,'We' would be me and Rick.,1,6
joey,Who's Rick?,1,6
chandler,Who's Rick?,1,6
aurora,My husband.,1,6
all,Ooh.,1,6
chandler,"Oh, so you are divorced?",1,6
aurora,No.,1,6
chandler,"Oh, I'm sorry, then you are widowed?...Hopefully?",1,6
aurora,"No, I'm still married.",1,6
chandler,"So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?",1,6
aurora,"Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.",1,6
chandler,"Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?",1,6
aurora,Mmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.,1,6
all,What?!,1,6
chandler,"So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?",1,6
aurora,I suppose mainly sexual.,1,6
chandler,...Hm.,1,6
monica,Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.,1,6
chandler,What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?,1,6
monica,"Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?",1,6
chandler,"Well, you know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff",1,6
phoebe,"Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?",1,6
ross,"No, of course not!  ...Yeah, yeah, it is.",1,6
monica,What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?,1,6
joey,I couldn't do it.,1,6
monica,"Good for you, Joey.",1,6
joey,"When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.",1,6
ross,"Well, you know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",1,6
ross,"Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.",1,6
monica,"We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!",1,6
all,Yeah! C'mon!,1,6
ross,"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",1,6
rachel,Tah-daaah!,1,6
chandler,Are we greeting each other this way now? Because I like that.,1,6
rachel,"Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that is for.",1,6
ross,"Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.",1,6
rachel,"Well, what do you think?",1,6
all,Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!,1,6
monica,...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.,1,6
all,Uh-oh...,1,6
monica,How-how did that happen?,1,6
rachel,"I don't know.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.",1,6
monica,"Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but you know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot.  Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.",1,6
phoebe,I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.,1,6
chandler,"Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.",1,6
monica,"You guys, I am not that bad!",1,6
phoebe,"Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, you know,  Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!",1,6
monica,That is so unfair!,1,6
ross,"Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!",1,6
monica,"Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.",1,6
ross,"Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.",1,6
monica,Why not?,1,6
ross,Because you are a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.,1,6
monica,I could do that.,1,6
rachel,"Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.",1,6
monica,Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.,1,6
chandler,"Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...",1,6
monica,STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?,1,6
ross,Monica? you are Mom.,1,6
phoebe,Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!,1,6
joey,"Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there!  That was my agent.  My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!",1,6
all,Oh my God! Woah!,1,6
monica,"Well, what's the part?",1,6
joey,"Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! ""I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. you are out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!""",1,6
phoebe,"Seriously, what-what's the part?",1,6
joey,"""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!""",1,6
ross,"C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?",1,6
joey,...I'm his,1,6
rachel,"..you are, you are 'mah mah mah' what?",1,6
joey,"...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.",1,6
monica,Oh my God.,1,6
joey,"C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that is big!",1,6
chandler,"Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's...you know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.",1,6
joey,"Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!",1,6
ross,"you are right, you are right, it is...So you going to invite us all to the big opening?",1,6
monica,"Alright, alright, alright...",1,6
joey,Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.,1,6
monica,For what?,1,6
joey,What do you think? Today's the big day!,1,6
monica,"Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.",1,6
joey,Thank you!,1,6
chandler,Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.,1,6
monica,He's in the bathroom. I don't think you want to go in there!,1,6
chandler,"C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!",1,6
monica,I warned you...,1,6
rachel,Who is being loud?,1,6
chandler,"Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I want to borrow a couple of things, Aurora spent the night, I really want to make her breakfast.",1,6
monica,"Oh, you got the whole night, huh?",1,6
chandler,"Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, you know..",1,6
rachel,"Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?",1,6
chandler,"No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. Okay? You know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?",1,6
monica,"Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? You know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not going to do that.",1,6
director,"...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?",1,6
joey,"Uh, listen, I just want to thank you for this great opportunity.",1,6
director,Lose the robe.,1,6
joey,Me?,1,6
director,That would work.,1,6
joey,Right. Okay. Losing the robe.  And the robe is lost.,1,6
director,"Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.",1,6
director,"And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?",1,6
joey,"Well, I'm- I'm showering.",1,6
director,"No, that was clenching.",1,6
joey,"Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, you know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.",1,6
director,"I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?",1,6
joey,I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...,1,6
chandler,"God, I love these fingers...",1,6
aurora,Thank you.,1,6
chandler,"No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at them, look at how happy they are.",1,6
aurora,"Oh my God, I'm late.",1,6
chandler,"Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..",1,6
aurora,Okay.,1,6
chandler,Don't go.,1,6
aurora,"Okay. Oh no, I have to.",1,6
chandler,"Too bad, she's leaving.",1,6
aurora,I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.,1,6
chandler,"Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.",1,6
aurora,It's not Rick.,1,6
chandler,"What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!",1,6
aurora,"No, it's-it's Andrew.",1,6
chandler,"I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?",1,6
aurora,He's... new.,1,6
chandler,"Oh, so what you are saying is you are not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?",1,6
aurora,"No, that is not exactly what I was..",1,6
chandler,"Well, you know, most women would kill for three guys like us.",1,6
aurora,So what do you want?,1,6
chandler,You.,1,6
aurora,You have me!,1,6
chandler,"No no, just you.",1,6
aurora,What do you mean?,1,6
chandler,Lose the other guys.,1,6
aurora,"...Like, ...all of them?",1,6
chandler,"C'mon, we're great together, why not?",1,6
aurora,"Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that is what you wanted too.",1,6
chandler,"...Well, you know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, you know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, you know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'",1,6
aurora,So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?,1,6
chandler,"I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...",1,6
aurora,Which one?,1,6
chandler,...The second guy.,1,6
aurora,"Well, call me if you change your mind.",1,6
chandler,"Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.",1,6
ross,Look at it this way,1,6
all,Hey!,1,6
monica,"Hey, wait wait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?",1,6
joey,Nope.,1,6
ross,"No? What happened, big guy?",1,6
chandler,"""Big guy?""",1,6
ross,It felt like a 'big guy' moment.,1,6
joey,I got fired.,1,6
all,Oh!,1,6
joey,"Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's going to go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...",1,6
rachel,"Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is going to be able to tell.",1,6
joey,My mom will.,1,6
chandler,Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.,1,6
joey,"You know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!",1,6
monica,Maybe this wasn't your shot.,1,6
ross,"Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, you know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?",1,6
joey,"Hard to tell, I was naked.",1,6
phoebe,"No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are going to happen for you, I do! You've got to just keep thinking about the day that some kid is going to run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm going to be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.",1,6
joey,Yeah? that is so nice!,1,6
monica,"I'm sorry, Joey. I'm going to go to bed, guys.",1,6
all,Night.,1,6
rachel,"Uh, Mon, you-you going to leave your shoes out here?",1,6
monica,Uh-huh!,1,6
rachel,Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?,1,6
monica,"Doesn't matter, I'll get them tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.",1,6
ross,She is a kook.,1,6
monica,"If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm going to go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!",1,6
rachel,"Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.",1,7
phoebe,"Hi. Um, I want to start with a song that is about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go.  OK, thank you very much.",1,7
chandler,"Oh, great. This is just...",1,7
rachel,"Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!",1,7
monica,"Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.",1,7
rachel,"Wow, you guys, this is big.",1,7
monica,"Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I going to meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.",1,7
phoebe,Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  What's my number?,1,7
phoebe,"Well, I never call me.",1,7
chandler,"Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.",1,7
jill,"Hi Mom, it's Jill.",1,7
chandler,"She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!",1,7
jill,"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.",1,7
chandler,Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.,1,7
jill,"I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.",1,7
chandler,"Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.",1,7
joey,Hi everyone.,1,7
ross,"And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.",1,7
joey,"Well, Chandler's old roommate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.",1,7
phoebe,"Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.",1,7
rachel,That had to hurt!,1,7
chandler,"Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!",1,7
chandler,There you go!,1,7
chandler,you are definitely scaring here.,1,7
jill,Would you like to call somebody?,1,7
chandler,"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.",1,7
monica,Hello?,1,7
chandler,"Hey, it's me.",1,7
monica,It's Chandler!  Are you OK?,1,7
chandler,"Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre.",1,7
monica,What?,1,7
chandler,I'm trapped... in an ATM vestibule... with Jill Goodacre!,1,7
monica,I have no idea what you just said.,1,7
chandler,Put Joey on the phone.,1,7
joey,What's up man?,1,7
chandler,I'm trapped... in an ATM vestibule... with JLL GDCR.,1,7
joey,"Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen.",1,7
chandler,"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.",1,7
rachel,"Alright, somebody.",1,7
monica,"OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.",1,7
all,Woah!,1,7
ross,that is my sister.,1,7
joey,OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York City public library.,1,7
monica,Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?,1,7
ross,"Pheebs, what about you?",1,7
phoebe,Oh... Milwaukee.,1,7
rachel,Um... Ross?,1,7
ross,"Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'",1,7
all,No way!,1,7
ross,"The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.",1,7
phoebe,"Oh, Rachel.",1,7
rachel,"Oh come on, I already went.",1,7
monica,You did not go!,1,7
all,Come on.,1,7
rachel,"Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.",1,7
ross,Step back.,1,7
joey,We have a winner!,1,7
rachel,"I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.",1,7
ross,"Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.",1,7
rachel,"There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.",1,7
ross,Come on.,1,7
rachel,"No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.",1,7
ross,And you didn't marry him because...?,1,7
rachel,"I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...",1,7
ross,"Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.",1,7
rachel,Yeah right.,1,7
ross,"It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you are left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.",1,7
rachel,OK.,1,7
ross,"But, um... I don't think that is going to be you.",1,7
rachel,You don't.,1,7
ross,"Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.",1,7
rachel,Really?,1,7
ross,Mmm.,1,7
rachel,You do?,1,7
ross,I do.,1,7
rachel,"Oh Ross, you are so great.",1,7
joey,It's never going to happen.,1,7
ross,What?,1,7
joey,You and Rachel.,1,7
ross,What?  Why not?,1,7
joey,"Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you are in the friend zone.",1,7
ross,"No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.",1,7
joey,"Ross, you are mayor of the zone.",1,7
ross,"I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...",1,7
joey,"Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you are thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you are going to end up stuck in the zone forever.",1,7
ross,"I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment.  What? What, now?",1,7
joey,"Yeah! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'",1,7
ross,Shh!,1,7
rachel,What are you shushing?,1,7
ross,We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.  Don't you hear that?,1,7
rachel,Ah!,1,7
ross,See?,1,7
rachel,Huh.,1,7
jill,Would you like some gum?,1,7
chandler,"Um, is it sugarless?",1,7
jill,"Sorry, it's not.",1,7
chandler,"Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note",1,7
phoebe,"New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, Because I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...",1,7
ross,"OK, here goes.",1,7
joey,Are you going to do it?,1,7
ross,I'm going to do it.,1,7
joey,Do you want any help?,1,7
ross,"You come out there, you are a dead man.",1,7
joey,"Good luck, man.",1,7
ross,Thanks.  OK.,1,7
joey,OK.,1,7
joey,"Hey, where are you going?",1,7
monica,Outside.,1,7
joey,You can't go out there.,1,7
monica,Why not?,1,7
joey,Because of... the reason.,1,7
monica,And that would be?,1,7
joey,"I, um, can't tell you.",1,7
monica,"Joey, what's going on?",1,7
joey,"OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.",1,7
monica,About what?,1,7
joey,He's planning your birthday party.,1,7
monica,Oh my God! I love him!,1,7
joey,You'd better act surprised.,1,7
phoebe,About what?,1,7
monica,My surprise party!,1,7
phoebe,What surprise party?,1,7
monica,Oh stop it. Joey already told me.,1,7
phoebe,"Well, he didn't tell me.",1,7
joey,"Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.",1,7
phoebe,This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.,1,7
monica,"No, you are not. We tell you stuff.",1,7
phoebe,Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.  Looks like I was second to last.,1,7
rachel,Hmmm... this is so nice.,1,7
ross,"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.",1,7
rachel,OK.,1,7
ross,"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....",1,7
rachel,oh!!!!,1,7
ross,"Yes, yes, that is right...",1,7
rachel,"Oh, look at the little cat!",1,7
ross,What?  Ow!,1,7
"monica, joey, and phoebe","I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...",1,7
monica,This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.,1,7
joey,"Sorry, that was wax.",1,7
phoebe,"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.",1,7
ross,Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?,1,7
rachel,During a blackout? He'd get trampled!,1,7
ross,Yeah?,1,7
chandler,"You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.  'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.",1,7
phoebe,"Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?",1,7
rachel,Oh.  Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.,1,7
mr. heckles,"Er, yeah, it's mine.",1,7
phoebe,He seems to hate you. Are you sure?,1,7
mr. heckles,"Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.",1,7
phoebe,Wait a minute. What's his name?,1,7
mr. heckles,Eh... B-Buttons.,1,7
rachel,Bob Buttons?,1,7
mr. heckles,"Mm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.",1,7
phoebe,Ooh! You are a very bad man!,1,7
mr. heckles,You owe me a cat.,1,7
rachel,"Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...",1,7
paolo,,1,7
rachel,Wow.,1,7
ross,Lucky sixes....,1,7
rachel,"Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.",1,7
monica,Hi!,1,7
rachel,And Joey....,1,7
monica,Hi!,1,7
rachel,And Ross.,1,7
monica,Hi!,1,7
paolo,,1,7
rachel,He doesn't speak much English.,1,7
paolo,Monopoly!,1,7
rachel,Look at that!,1,7
ross,"So, um... where did Paolo come from?",1,7
rachel,"Oh... Italy, I think.",1,7
ross,"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.",1,7
rachel,"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!",1,7
ross,"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.",1,7
phoebe,Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.,1,7
rachel,"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.",1,7
phoebe,Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.,1,7
rachel,"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.",1,7
paolo,,1,7
phoebe,You bet!,1,7
chandler,"Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.",1,7
chandler,"Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.",1,7
chandler,"Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...  ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you are choking.",1,7
jill,Are you alright?,1,7
jill,"My God, you are choking!  That better?",1,7
chandler,Yes... thank you. That was... that was....,1,7
jill,Perfection?,1,7
paolo,,1,7
ross,"Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blah....",1,7
ross,Wha-What did he say that was so funny?,1,7
rachel,I have absolutely no idea.,1,7
ross,that is... that is classic.,1,7
rachel,"Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!",1,7
monica,"If you want, I'll do it.",1,7
phoebe,"I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip.  But I won't.",1,7
rachel,"God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.",1,7
phoebe,"You know, did you ride mopeds? Because I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.",1,7
rachel,"You know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Good....",1,7
ross,Paolo. Hi.,1,7
paolo,Ross!,1,7
ross,"Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.",1,7
paolo,Thing?,1,7
ross,"Thing, yes. Thing.",1,7
paolo,"Ah, you... have the sex?",1,7
ross,"No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that is... see, that is not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...",1,7
paolo,Bed?,1,7
ross,"No, no, that is not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.",1,7
paolo,Oh!,1,7
ross,Yeah! Se vice?,1,7
paolo,Si.,1,7
ross,So you do know a little English.,1,7
paolo,Poco... a leetle.,1,7
ross,Do you know the word crap weasel?,1,7
paolo,No.,1,7
ross,"that is funny, because you know, you are a huge crap weasel!",1,7
jill,"Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.",1,7
chandler,OK.,1,7
jill,Ready?,1,7
jill,"No, you've got to whip it.",1,7
phoebe,"Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....",1,7
ross,Thank you.,1,7
phoebe,Thanks.,1,7
ross,Kind of... spooky without any lights.,1,7
joey,Bwah-hah-hah!,1,7
ross,"OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...",1,7
ross,Oh.. oh... oh.,1,7
joey,"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.",1,7
jill,"Well, this has been fun.",1,7
chandler,"Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.",1,7
jill,"Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See you.",1,7
chandler,"Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.",1,7
chandler,Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?,1,8
shelley,"Question. you are not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.",1,8
chandler,"Ah, you see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...",1,8
shelley,Do you want a date Saturday?,1,8
chandler,Yes please.,1,8
shelley,"Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-",1,8
chandler,He's a he?,1,8
shelley,"Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just going to go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...",1,8
chandler,"...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?",1,8
rachel,"Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, you know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...",1,8
chandler,You did?,1,8
rachel,"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.",1,8
chandler,"Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?",1,8
monica,I did.,1,8
phoebe,"Yeah, I think so, yeah.",1,8
joey,Not me.,1,8
ross,"No no, me neither. Although, uh, you know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.",1,8
chandler,you are kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?,1,8
ross,"No. No, it's just Because, uh, I kind of wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...",1,8
chandler,"Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?",1,8
phoebe,"I do not know, because you are smart, you are funny...",1,8
chandler,"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?",1,8
all,Yeah! Right!,1,8
chandler,WHAT IS IT?!,1,8
monica,"Okay, I-I do not know, you-you just- you have a quality.",1,8
all,Yes. Absolutely. A quality.,1,8
chandler,"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were going to be vague about this.",1,8
monica,"Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.",1,8
rachel,"Oh my God! Calling from Rome!  Bon giorno, caro mio.",1,8
ross,So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just got to go to Rome.,1,8
rachel,"Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome.",1,8
monica,"Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.",1,8
ross,"So, uh, how's she doing?",1,8
aunt lillian,The doctor says it's a matter of hours.,1,8
monica,"How-how are you, Mom?",1,8
mrs. geller,"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you are here. ...What's with your hair?",1,8
monica,What?,1,8
mrs. geller,What's different?,1,8
monica,Nothing.,1,8
mrs. geller,"Oh, maybe that is it.",1,8
monica,"She is unbelievable, our mother is...",1,8
ross,"Okay, relax, relax. We are going to be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.",1,8
monica,Oh God!,1,8
monica,The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.,1,8
ross,"Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.",1,8
mr. geller,"Not just restaurants, from our house.",1,8
nurse,Mrs. Geller?,1,8
ross,She looks so small.,1,8
monica,I know.,1,8
ross,"Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.",1,8
monica,"Good bye, Nana.",1,8
ross,"Bye, Nana.",1,8
monica,Ross!,1,8
mrs. geller,What is going on?!,1,8
ross,"You know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..",1,8
mrs. geller,What?,1,8
ross,"She's not- past, she's present, she's back.",1,8
aunt lillian,What's going on?,1,8
mr. geller,She may have died.,1,8
aunt lillian,She may have died?,1,8
mr. geller,We're looking into it.,1,8
ross,"I, uh, I'll go see.",1,8
nurse,This almost never happens!,1,8
ross,Now she's passed.,1,8
chandler,"I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?",1,8
rachel,"Yes, Chandler, that is exactly what it is. It's your hair.",1,8
phoebe,"Yeah, you have homosexual hair.",1,8
rachel,"So, um, did she...",1,8
ross,Twice.,1,8
joey,Twice?,1,8
phoebe,"Oh, that sucks!",1,8
joey,You guys okay?,1,8
ross,"I don't know, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...",1,8
phoebe,Maybe that is Because she's not really gone.,1,8
ross,"No no, she's gone.",1,8
monica,We checked. A lot.,1,8
phoebe,"Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, you know?  Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, you know? ...I miss her.",1,8
rachel,"Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?",1,8
phoebe,Thanks!,1,8
rachel,Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.,1,8
joey,"Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you are dead, you are dead! you are gone! you are worm food!  ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?",1,8
phoebe,"You know, I don't know who this is, but it's not Debbie.",1,8
ross,I thought it was going to be a closed casket.,1,8
mrs. geller,"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!",1,8
mrs. geller,"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?",1,8
ross,I don't see why not.,1,8
ross,Here's my retainer!,1,8
mr. geller,I was just thinking. When my time comes-,1,8
monica,Dad!,1,8
mr. geller,"Listen to me! When my time comes, I want to be buried at sea.",1,8
monica,You what?,1,8
mr. geller,"I want to be buried at sea, it looks like fun.",1,8
monica,Define fun.,1,8
mr. geller,"C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...",1,8
monica,"...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.",1,8
mr. geller,"Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.",1,8
monica,that is probably what they'll say.,1,8
mr. geller,I'd like that.,1,8
chandler,"Hey, gorgeous.",1,8
shelley,"Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-",1,8
chandler,"No, no no, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.",1,8
shelley,Oh! Okay! Phew!,1,8
chandler,"So, uh... what do you think it is about me?",1,8
shelley,"I don't know, uh... you just have a-a...",1,8
chandler,"...Quality, right, great.",1,8
shelley,"You know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.",1,8
chandler,"Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that is who you saw me with?",1,8
shelley,What? He's cute!,1,8
chandler,"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.",1,8
shelley,Is Brian...?,1,8
chandler,"No! Uh, I would know! The point is, if you were going to set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.",1,8
shelley,"Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.",1,8
chandler,Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.,1,8
ross,This one?,1,8
aunt lillian,No.,1,8
ross,"I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.",1,8
aunt lillian,"You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.",1,8
mrs. geller,you are right. We'll go with the burgundy.,1,8
ross,Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.,1,8
aunt lillian,Wait! We need shoes!,1,8
ross,"Okay. Um, how about these?",1,8
mrs. geller,that is really a day shoe.,1,8
ross,And where she's going everyone else will be dressier?,1,8
aunt lillian,Could we see something in a slimmer heel?,1,8
ross,"Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.",1,8
aunt lillian,"No, it really should be burgundy.",1,8
mrs. geller,Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?,1,8
ross,"No! No no no, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.",1,8
ross,Oh my God..,1,8
mrs. geller,"Is everything all right, dear?",1,8
ross,"Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.",1,8
ross,"How we doing, you guys ready?",1,8
monica,Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?,1,8
ross,Some days it's all I can think about.,1,8
phoebe,"Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.",1,8
rachel,"Oh, you-you mean your earrings?",1,8
phoebe,What'd I say?,1,8
rachel,Hm-m.,1,8
monica,Are these the shoes?,1,8
rachel,Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.,1,8
ross,"What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?",1,8
joey,Morning. We ready to go?,1,8
chandler,"Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?",1,8
monica,It was a really beautiful service.,1,8
mrs. geller,"It really was. Oh, come here, sweetheart. you know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.",1,8
joey,What?,1,8
chandler,"Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.",1,8
joey,"Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.",1,8
chandler,you are watching a football game at a funeral?,1,8
joey,"No, it's the pre-game. I'm going to watch it at the reception.",1,8
chandler,"You are a frightening, frightening man.",1,8
rachel,Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!,1,8
ross,"Oh, I hope they're not ruined.",1,8
phoebe,"God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!",1,8
ross,"I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I don't know, almost life-aff-",1,8
all,God! Ross!,1,8
ross,I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...,1,8
phoebe,"Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.",1,8
ross,"What, what is it?",1,8
phoebe,You missed a belt loop.,1,8
ross,Oh! No-n-,1,8
phoebe,"Okay, it's in spasm.",1,8
mrs. geller,"Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.",1,8
chandler,"Oh, no-",1,8
andrea,"Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.",1,8
chandler,"Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.",1,8
phoebe,"Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?",1,8
ross,"I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.",1,8
monica,"Wow, those pills really worked, huh?",1,8
ross,"Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...",1,8
phoebe,Ooh! that is so nice...,1,8
ross,...Chandler!,1,8
chandler,Hey.,1,8
ross,"And listen, man, if you want to be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.",1,8
andrea,You were right.,1,8
ross,Rachel. Rachel Rachel.  I love you the most.,1,8
rachel,"Oh, well you know who I love the most?",1,8
ross,No.,1,8
rachel,You!,1,8
ross,Oh.. you don't get it!,1,8
mr. geller,What have you got there?,1,8
joey,"Just a, uh... hearing disability.",1,8
mr. geller,What's the score?,1,8
joey,Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.,1,8
mr. geller,Beautiful!,1,8
rachel,"Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?",1,8
mrs. geller,Your grandmother would have hated this.,1,8
monica,"Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.",1,8
mrs. geller,"No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.",1,8
monica,That sounds like Nana.,1,8
mrs. geller,Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?,1,8
monica,...I can imagine.,1,8
mrs. geller,"I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.",1,8
monica,"That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?",1,8
mrs. geller,Tell her what?,1,8
monica,"How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.",1,8
mrs. geller,I'm not sure I know what you are getting at.,1,8
monica,Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?,1,8
mrs. geller,...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.,1,8
monica,Huh.,1,8
mrs. geller,"More wine, dear?",1,8
monica,"Oh, I think so.",1,8
mrs. geller,Those earrings look really lovely on you.,1,8
monica,Thank you. They're yours.,1,8
mrs. geller,Actually they were Nana's.,1,8
mr. geller,Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.,1,8
rachel,"Hey, who's this little naked guy?",1,8
ross,That little naked guy would be me.,1,8
rachel,"Aww, look at the little thing.",1,8
ross,"Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?",1,8
chandler,Who are those people?,1,8
ross,Got me.,1,8
monica,"Oh, that is Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.",1,8
rachel,"Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?",1,8
monica,"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?",1,8
ross,Looks like a fun gang.,1,8
joey,"Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!",1,8
ross,"No no, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.",1,8
chandler,"Hey, Lowell.",1,8
lowell,"Hey, Chandler.",1,8
chandler,So how's it going there in Financial Services?,1,8
lowell,It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?,1,8
chandler,"Good, good. Listen, heh, I don't know what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.",1,8
lowell,I know. that is what I told her.,1,8
chandler,Really.,1,8
lowell,Yeah.,1,8
chandler,So- you can tell?,1,8
lowell,"Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.",1,8
chandler,"So you don't think I have a, a quality?",1,8
lowell,"Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.",1,8
chandler,He is?,1,8
lowell,"Yup, and way out of your league.",1,8
chandler,"Out of my league. I could get a Brian.  If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian.  Hey, Brian.",1,8
rachel,"Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?",1,9
terry,An advance?,1,9
rachel,"It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.",1,9
terry,"Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. you are a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.",1,9
rachel,"Ok, I, I hear what you are saying'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?  Oh, look at that.",1,9
rachel,"Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?",1,9
guy,Huh?,1,9
rachel,"Ok, ok, that is fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.",1,9
monica,"Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?",1,9
ross,"No, they're not.",1,9
monica,"Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.",1,9
ross,you are wrong.,1,9
monica,I am not wrong.,1,9
ross,you are wrong.,1,9
monica,"No, I just talked to them.",1,9
ross,I'm calling Mom.,1,9
joey,"Hey, hey.",1,9
chandler,Hey.,1,9
phoebe,Hey.,1,9
chandler,And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?,1,9
joey,"Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.",1,9
chandler,"that is so funny, Because I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.",1,9
phoebe,What were you modelling for?,1,9
joey,You know those posters for the city free clinic?,1,9
monica,"Oh, wow, so you are going to be one of those ""healthy, healthy, healthy guys""?",1,9
phoebe,"You know, the asthma guy was really cute.",1,9
chandler,Do you know which one you are going to be?,1,9
joey,"No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...",1,9
chandler,"Good luck, man. I hope you get it.",1,9
joey,Thanks.,1,9
ross,"Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.",1,9
monica,"Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.",1,9
ross,Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?,1,9
monica,"You know, they're not actually supposed to have...  I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you are going home, right?",1,9
joey,Yeah.,1,9
monica,"And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.",1,9
chandler,"Yes, every single one of them.",1,9
monica,"Phoebe, you are going to be with your grandma?",1,9
phoebe,"Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December Because he is lunar.",1,9
monica,"So you are free Thursday, then.",1,9
phoebe,"Yeah. Oh, can I come?",1,9
monica,"Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you are going to make it to Vail?",1,9
rachel,"Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.",1,9
chandler,I thought it was $98.50.,1,9
rachel,"Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.",1,9
ross,"Well, I'm off to Carol's.",1,9
phoebe,"Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?",1,9
ross,"Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.",1,9
ross,"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?",1,9
susan,"No, she's at a faculty meeting.",1,9
ross,"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan",1,9
ross,"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.",1,9
susan,What's it look like?,1,9
ross,Kind of like a big face without skin.,1,9
susan,"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.",1,9
ross,"Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being' a lesbian.",1,9
susan,"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",1,9
ross,"Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.",1,9
susan,"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",1,9
ross,"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you are... crazy?",1,9
susan,"What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?",1,9
ross,"you are not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?",1,9
susan,"Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.",1,9
ross,"Do you uh, do you talk about me?",1,9
susan,"Yeah, yeah, all the time.",1,9
ross,Really?,1,9
susan,"But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.",1,9
ross,"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.",1,9
phoebe,"Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.",1,9
chandler,"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.",1,9
monica,"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?",1,9
rachel,"No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.",1,9
monica,"Rach, here's your mail.",1,9
rachel,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table.",1,9
monica,"No, here's your mail.",1,9
rachel,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table.",1,9
monica,Would you just open it?,1,9
rachel,"Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.",1,9
monica,We all chipped in.,1,9
joey,We did?,1,9
monica,You owe me 20 bucks.,1,9
rachel,Thank you. Thank you so much!,1,9
monica,"Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixing's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.",1,9
rachel,"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you are having' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?",1,9
chandler,"All right, I'm nine years old.",1,9
ross,"Oh, I hate this story.",1,9
chandler,"We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.",1,9
rachel,Oh my god.,1,9
chandler,Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.,1,9
joey,"Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.",1,9
girl,We did?,1,9
joey,"Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.  Aramis? Aramis?",1,9
girl,"Yeah, right.",1,9
joey,I got to tell you. you are the best in the business.,1,9
girl,Get out.,1,9
joey,"I'm serious. you are amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.",1,9
girl,Really? You don't know what that means to me.,1,9
joey,"Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?",1,9
girl,Nothing.,1,9
joey,"Listen, uh, you want to go get a drink or something?",1,9
girl,Yeah.  Oh.,1,9
joey,What's wrong?,1,9
girl,"I just remembered, I have to do something.",1,9
joey,Oh. What?,1,9
girl,"Um, leave.",1,9
joey,"Wait, wait, wait!",1,9
joey,So I guess you all saw it.,1,9
rachel,Saw what?,1,9
phoebe,"No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.",1,9
joey,Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.,1,9
chandler,"Tonight, on a very special Blossom.",1,9
monica,"Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.  What?",1,9
ross,I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.,1,9
monica,"All right, that is it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.",1,9
ross,that is closer.,1,9
rachel,"I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.",1,9
chandler,"Oh, you must stop shooping.",1,9
rachel,"Ok, I'm going to get my stuff.",1,9
joey,"Chandler, will you just come in already?",1,9
chandler,"No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.",1,9
phoebe,"Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!",1,9
chandler,"Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that is not funny anymore.",1,9
joey,"Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.",1,9
monica,that is not a question.,1,9
joey,"But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.",1,9
monica,"All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.",1,9
ross,"Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.",1,9
monica,Ah!,1,9
ross,"Ok, Mom never hit.",1,9
phoebe,"Ok, all done.",1,9
monica,"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!",1,9
phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.",1,9
monica,Why would we do that?,1,9
phoebe,"Well, Because then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.",1,9
monica,"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.",1,9
rachel,"Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!",1,9
chandler,The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.,1,9
joey,The balloon?,1,9
chandler,"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm going' to the roof, who's with me?",1,9
rachel,"I can't, I got to go.",1,9
chandler,Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?,1,9
phoebe,Almost never.,1,9
monica,Got the keys? or Got the keys!,1,9
rachel,Ok.,1,9
carol,Anytime you are ready.,1,9
ross,"Ok, ok, here we go.  Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...",1,9
carol,Just aim for the bump.,1,9
ross,"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.",1,9
carol,"So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.",1,9
ross,"Hello, baby. Hello, hello.",1,9
rachel,I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.,1,9
phoebe,"Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.",1,9
monica,"Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?",1,9
rachel,We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.,1,9
monica,No I don't.,1,9
rachel,"Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys.""",1,9
monica,"No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?""",1,9
rachel,"No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys"".",1,9
chandler,Do either of you have the keys?,1,9
monica,The oven is on.,1,9
rachel,"Oh, I got to get my ticket!",1,9
joey,"Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.",1,9
monica,"Well then get it, get it!",1,9
joey,That tone will not make me go any faster.,1,9
monica,Joey!,1,9
joey,That one will.,1,9
ross,"And everyone's telling me, you got to pick a major, you got to pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked palaeontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you are a fetus. you are just happy you don't have gills anymore.",1,9
carol,"Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.",1,9
ross,"Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?",1,9
susan,"Hi, how's it going?",1,9
ross,"Shh!  Here we come, walking' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey!  Hey, uh, did you just feel that?",1,9
carol,I did.,1,9
ross,"Does it always, uh--?",1,9
carol,"No, no that was the first.",1,9
susan,Keep singing! Keep singing!,1,9
ross,"Hey, hey, you are my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.",1,9
susan,I felt it!,1,9
ross,"Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.",1,9
joey,"Nope, not that one.",1,9
monica,Can you go any faster with that?,1,9
joey,"Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.",1,9
monica,Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?,1,9
chandler,For an emergency just like this.,1,9
rachel,"All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this  right now. But I'm not.",1,9
monica,I swear you said you had the keys.,1,9
rachel,"No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.",1,9
phoebe,"Ooh, ok, that is it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.",1,9
monica,Why would I have the keys?,1,9
rachel,Aside from the fact that you said you had them?,1,9
monica,But I didn't.,1,9
rachel,"Well, you should have.",1,9
monica,Why?,1,9
rachel,Because!,1,9
monica,Why?,1,9
rachel,Because!,1,9
monica,"Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? No, no, no!  Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...",1,9
chandler,"Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.",1,9
monica,"Well, the turkey's burnt.  Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.",1,9
ross,"Here we come, walking' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's.",1,9
monica,"No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross?  Well, here you go, buddy, you got one.",1,9
rachel,"Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.",1,9
joey,"Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.",1,9
monica,"Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?",1,9
joey,You call that delicious?,1,9
monica,"Stop it, stop it, stop it!",1,9
chandler,Now this feels like Thanksgiving.,1,9
phoebe,Ooh.,1,9
rachel,What?,1,9
phoebe,Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.,1,9
joey,I've got to see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!,1,9
monica,"Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!",1,9
phoebe,It's nice that he has someone.,1,9
chandler,Shall I carve?,1,9
rachel,By all means.,1,9
chandler,"Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?",1,9
ross,I don't even want to know about the dark cheese.,1,9
monica,Does anybody want to split this with me?,1,9
joey,"Oh, I will.",1,9
phoebe,"Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.",1,9
monica,Make a wish?,1,9
phoebe,"Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?",1,9
joey,The bigger half.,1,9
chandler,"I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys would been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",1,9
all,that is so sweet.,1,9
ross,"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.",1,9
rachel,And a crappy New Year.,1,9
chandler,"Here, here!",1,9
ross,Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.,1,10
all,Ooh!,1,10
monica,W-wait. What is that?,1,10
ross,That' would be Marcel. You want to say hi?,1,10
monica,"No, no, I don't.",1,10
rachel,"Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?",1,10
ross,My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.,1,10
phoebe,That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?,1,10
chandler,"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!",1,10
monica,"Ross, is he going to live with you, like, in your apartment?",1,10
ross,"Yeah. I mean, it's been kind of quiet since Carol left, so...",1,10
monica,Why don't you just get a roommate?,1,10
ross,"Nah, I don't know... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kind of pathe-  ....sorry, that is, that is 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.",1,10
phoebe,"So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.",1,10
chandler,Might want to open with the snowman.,1,10
all,"Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.",1,10
monica,"So, how'd it go?",1,10
joey,"Ah, I didn't get the job.",1,10
ross,How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.,1,10
joey,"I don't know. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.",1,10
monica,So what are you going to be?,1,10
joey,"Ah, I'm going to be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, you know?",1,10
rachel,"Hey, do you guys know what you are doing for New Year's?  Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?",1,10
chandler,"Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday",1,10
rachel,"Well, for your information, Paolo is going to be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.",1,10
phoebe,"Yeah, you wish!",1,10
chandler,"It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.",1,10
all,"Yeah, okay. Alright.",1,10
chandler,"You know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.",1,10
all,Woooo! Yeah!,1,10
rachel,"Phoebe, you are on.",1,10
phoebe,"Oh, oh, good.",1,10
rachel,"Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!",1,10
phoebe,"Thanks, hi. Um, I want to start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.",1,10
phoebe,,1,10
phoebe,,1,10
max,"No. No, that is- that is okay.",1,10
phoebe,"Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!",1,10
chandler,That guy's going home with a note!,1,10
david,Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-,1,10
phoebe,Could you speak up please?,1,10
david,"Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought",1,10
max,Daryl Hannah.,1,10
david,"Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a",1,10
max,Hard quality.,1,10
david,"-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that is when you started yelling.",1,10
phoebe,"Okay, we're going to take a short break.",1,10
joey,"Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!",1,10
ross,"Come here, Marcel. Sit here.",1,10
rachel,"Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?",1,10
ross,Just a smidge.,1,10
phoebe,"David's like, you know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.",1,10
monica,I think it's romantic.,1,10
phoebe,Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?,1,10
rachel,Yeah!,1,10
phoebe,"Well, he's kind of like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just want to be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...",1,10
chandler,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you are going to ask him to New Year's, aren't you. you are going to break the pact. She's going to break the pact.",1,10
phoebe,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?",1,10
chandler,"Yeah, because I already asked Janice.",1,10
monica,What?!,1,10
ross,"C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!",1,10
chandler,"I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.",1,10
monica,"Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!",1,10
chandler,"I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!",1,10
joey,"Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.",1,10
chandler,Too many jokes... must mock Joey!,1,10
joey,"Nice shoes, huh?",1,10
chandler,"Aah, you are killing me!",1,10
monica,Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!,1,10
ross,"Okay, look, he's not going to hurt them, right?",1,10
monica,Do you always have to bring him here?,1,10
ross,"I didn't want to leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...",1,10
chandler,"You know, if you are going to work late, I could look in on him for you.",1,10
ross,"Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you are there to see him, okay, and you are not like doing it as a favour to me.",1,10
chandler,"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.",1,10
david,"...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.",1,10
phoebe,"Okay, alright, I have a question, then.",1,10
david,Yuh.,1,10
phoebe,"Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?",1,10
david,"Uh, that is definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be  yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, Because it's you.",1,10
phoebe,Sure.,1,10
david,"Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just got to be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sort of fella.",1,10
phoebe,"Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sort of fella. I mean, you are a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.",1,10
david,Really.,1,10
phoebe,"Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.",1,10
david,...Now? Now?,1,10
phoebe,"Oh yeah, right now.",1,10
david,"Okay, okay, okay. you know what, this was just really expensive.  And I'll take- this was a gift.",1,10
phoebe,"Okay, now you are just kind of tidying.",1,10
david,"Okay, what the hell, what the hell.  You want me to actually throw you or you-you want to just hop?",1,10
phoebe,I can hop.,1,10
ross,So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?,1,10
monica,"I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.",1,10
chandler,Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?,1,10
monica,Yeah.,1,10
joey,You know more than one Fun Bobby?,1,10
chandler,I happen to know a Fun Bob.,1,10
rachel,"Okay, here we go...",1,10
joey,"Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!",1,10
rachel,There. Now there is.,1,10
ross,"Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.",1,10
joey,"Uh, four.",1,10
ross,Four.,1,10
rachel,Five.,1,10
ross,Five.,1,10
rachel,Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.,1,10
joey,"Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?",1,10
ross,"Okay, so I'm going to be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?",1,10
rachel,"Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.",1,10
ross,"Hey, you know, this is so not what I needed right now.",1,10
monica,What's the matter?,1,10
ross,"Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, you know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...",1,10
chandler,"that is so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.",1,10
ross,Really.,1,10
chandler,"Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.",1,10
ross,"What, uh... what juggling thing?",1,10
chandler,With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.,1,10
ross,No.,1,10
chandler,"You know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...",1,10
max,Phoebe. Hi.,1,10
phoebe,"Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?",1,10
max,No. Have you seen David?,1,10
phoebe,"No, no, he hasn't been around.",1,10
max,"Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.",1,10
phoebe,Minsk?,1,10
max,Minsk. It's in Russia.,1,10
phoebe,I know where Minsk is.,1,10
max,"We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.",1,10
phoebe,"So when, when do you leave?",1,10
max,January first.,1,10
phoebe,Hello?,1,10
david,Hey!,1,10
phoebe,Hi.,1,10
david,Hi!  What-what're you doing here?,1,10
phoebe,"Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so  congratulations! This is so exciting!",1,10
max,It'd be even more exciting if we were going.,1,10
phoebe,"Oh, you are not going?  Oh, why?",1,10
max,"Tell her, David. 'I don't want to go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on no no no no no no no. I want to stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'",1,10
david,"Thank you, Max. Thank you.",1,10
phoebe,So-so you are really not going?,1,10
david,I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do. I just- you decide.,1,10
phoebe,Oh don't do that.,1,10
david,Please.,1,10
phoebe,Oh no no.,1,10
david,"No, but I'm asking-",1,10
phoebe,"Oh, but I can't do that-",1,10
david,"No, but I can't-",1,10
phoebe,"It's your thing, and-",1,10
david,-make the decision-,1,10
phoebe,"Okay, um, stay.",1,10
david,Stay.,1,10
phoebe,Stay.,1,10
phoebe,Getting so good at that!,1,10
david,It was Max's stuff.,1,10
janice,"I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!",1,10
chandler,You remember Janice.,1,10
monica,Vividly.,1,10
monica,Hi.,1,10
sandy,"Hi, I'm Sandy.",1,10
joey,Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.,1,10
sandy,"Yeah. that is okay, right?",1,10
ross,Par-tay!,1,10
monica,That thing is not coming in here.,1,10
ross,"'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?",1,10
monica,I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.,1,10
ross,Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...,1,10
monica,Alright. Just keep him away from me.,1,10
ross,"Thank you.  C'mon, Marcel, what do you say you and I do a little mingling?  Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.",1,10
monica,"Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?",1,10
rachel,Rome. Jerk missed his flight.,1,10
phoebe,And then... your face is bloated?,1,10
rachel,"No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party?  Are people eating my dip?",1,10
sandy,"You know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.",1,10
joey,"Wow, that is, uh, dirty.",1,10
sandy,Yeah.,1,10
joey,"Hey, kids...",1,10
ross,"Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.",1,10
janice,"There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!",1,10
chandler,But you found me!,1,10
janice,"Here, Ross, take our picture.  Smile! you are on Janice Camera!",1,10
chandler,Kill me. Kill me now.,1,10
monica,Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!,1,10
fun bobby,"Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!",1,10
joey,Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?,1,10
fun bobby,"It's going to be an open casket, you know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.",1,10
janice,"Oh, I'm going to blow this one up, and I'm going to write 'Reunited' in glitter.",1,10
chandler,"Alright, Janice, that is it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-",1,10
janice,"Oh, no. Oh, no.",1,10
chandler,I'm sorry you misunderstood...,1,10
janice,"Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just going to be your last chance with me.",1,10
chandler,"Oh, will you give me the thing.",1,10
phoebe,"Hi, Max!",1,10
max,Yoko.  I've decided to go to Minsk without you.,1,10
david,Wow.,1,10
max,It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.,1,10
phoebe,Are you alright?,1,10
david,"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.",1,10
phoebe,you are going to Minsk.,1,10
david,"No, I'm... not going to Minsk.",1,10
phoebe,"Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just Because of me.",1,10
david,"Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.",1,10
phoebe,"Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that is what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say  'no! No! I can't understand that!'.",1,10
david,"Uh, ow.",1,10
phoebe,"Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me.  And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.",1,10
david,I'll never forget you.,1,10
phoebe,And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't want to start the new year with me if you can't finish it.  I'm going to miss you. You scientist guy.,1,10
dick clark,"Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...",1,10
joey,"There you go, kids.",1,10
chandler,And then the peacock bit me.  Please kiss me at midnight.,1,10
joey,You seen Sandy?,1,10
chandler,"Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.",1,10
rachel,"Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.",1,10
all,What?,1,10
rachel,The bll is drrbing!,1,10
dick clark,In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...,1,10
chandler,And the moment of joy is upon us.,1,10
joey,Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.,1,10
phoebe,Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.,1,10
monica,Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!,1,10
chandler,"You know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.",1,10
phoebe,I don't know. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.,1,10
rachel,I can't kiss anyone.,1,10
monica,So I'm kissing everyone?,1,10
joey,"No no no, you can't kiss Ross, that is your brother.",1,10
ross,Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.,1,10
chandler,"Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!",1,10
joey,Alright alright alright.  There.,1,10
ross,"I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, picking' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.",1,10
rachel,...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.,1,10
phoebe,Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?,1,11
monica,Why?,1,11
phoebe,"Just want to check my horoscope, see if it was right.",1,11
monica,"Oh my God.  Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.",1,11
phoebe,"Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.",1,11
monica,"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.",1,11
guy,Nice hat.,1,11

monica,No!,1,11
phoebe,Do it!,1,11
monica,No!,1,11
phoebe,Do it do it do it!,1,11
monica,Woo-woo!,1,11
phoebe,I can't believe you did that!,1,11
monica,"Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?",1,11
phoebe,"I just wish there was something we could do.  Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!",1,11
monica,"Phoebe, what are you doing?",1,11
phoebe,Maybe nobody's tried this.,1,11
monica,"I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.",1,11
phoebe,"Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.",1,11
monica,"Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!",1,11
phoebe,"Oh! And, he's the kind of guy who, when you are talking, he's listening, you know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.",1,11
monica,I wish all guys could be like him.,1,11
phoebe,I know.,1,11
chandler,Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?,1,11
monica,He doesn't have anyone.,1,11
phoebe,"Yeah, we-we feel kind of responsible.",1,11
joey,I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.,1,11
rachel,"Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!",1,11
jay leno,"Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound'",1,11
chandler,"You know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.",1,11
rachel,"No way, forget it.",1,11
joey,"C'mon, she's your mom!",1,11
chandler,"Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?",1,11
rachel,"Chandler, I got to tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!",1,11
chandler,"Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you are eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'",1,11
ross,"C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.",1,11
chandler,You can say that because she's not your mom.,1,11
ross,"Oh, please...",1,11
paolo,Bona sera.,1,11
rachel,"Oh, hi sweetie.",1,11
ross,When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?,1,11
monica,Last night.,1,11
ross,"Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.",1,11
phoebe,Hey hey hey! She's on!,1,11
paolo,Ah! Nora Bing!,1,11
jay leno,...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?,1,11
phoebe,Your mom was arrested?,1,11
chandler,"Shhh, busy beaming with pride.",1,11
mrs. bing,"...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...",1,11
chandler,Now why would she say that is embarrassing?,1,11
all,Shhh.,1,11
mrs. bing,...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.,1,11
chandler,that is TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!,1,11
jay leno,"Alright, so now you are doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?",1,11
mrs. bing,"Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...",1,11
all,Aww!,1,11
chandler,This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.,1,11
jay leno,"You know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...",1,11
mrs. bing,"Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.",1,11
chandler,...And then he burst into flames.,1,11
monica,"Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.",1,11
phoebe,What about Glen? He could be a Glen.,1,11
monica,Nah... not-not special enough.,1,11
phoebe,Ooh! How about Agamemnon?,1,11
monica,Way too special.,1,11
mrs. bing,I am famished. What do I want...,1,11
chandler,Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.,1,11
mrs. bing,"Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?",1,11
chandler,"Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.",1,11
ross,What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.,1,11
mrs. bing,"Ooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. give me a hug.  Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.",1,11
chandler,I know I am.,1,11
mrs. bing,Who's doing shots?,1,11
monica,Yeah.,1,11
phoebe,I'm in.,1,11
mrs. bing,There you go. Ross?,1,11
ross,"Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kind of guy.",1,11
rachel,"Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kind of just, you know, lost track of time.",1,11
ross,...But a man can change.,1,11
ross,Anyone want me to appraise anything?,1,11
rachel,"Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.",1,11
mrs. bing,"Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.",1,11
chandler,"My mother, ladies and gentlemen.",1,11
mrs. bing,"Yeah, any messages for room 226?",1,11
mrs. bing,"You okay there, slugger?",1,11
ross,"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.",1,11
mrs. bing,What is with you tonight?,1,11
ross,Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.,1,11
mrs. bing,"Okay, thank you.  It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.",1,11
ross,No. It's the one he's licking.,1,11
mrs. bing,She's supposed to be with you.,1,11
ross,you are good.,1,11
mrs. bing,"Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and you know why?",1,11
ross,The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?,1,11
mrs. bing,"No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, you know, complication you eventually kill off.",1,11
ross,When?,1,11
mrs. bing,He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.,1,11
ross,The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?,1,11
mrs. bing,"No, it's you!",1,11
ross,Please.,1,11
mrs. bing,"No, really, c'mon. you are smart, you are sexy...",1,11
ross,Right.,1,11

ross,"Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell...  Okay, Because I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?",1,11
joey,Right. No big deal.,1,11
ross,Okay.,1,11
joey,In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!,1,11
ross,What code?,1,11
joey,"You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-looking' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!",1,11
chandler,What are you guys doing out here?,1,11
ross,"Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.",1,11
joey,"Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.",1,11
ross,"No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.",1,11
joey,"Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.",1,11
chandler,"Okay, you guys spend way too much time together.",1,11
ross,"Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.",1,11
joey,"Ross, how could you let this happen?",1,11
ross,"I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, you know? She's, she's sexy, she's...",1,11
joey,You don't think my mom's sexy?,1,11
ross,Well... not in the same way...,1,11
joey,"I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?",1,11
ross,"Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...",1,11
rachel,Hey.,1,11
ross,Hey.,1,11
rachel,What're you guys doing out here?,1,11
ross,"Well, not playing racquetball!",1,11
joey,He forgot to leave his grip size!,1,11
ross,He didn't get the goggles!,1,11
rachel,"Well, sounds like you two have issues.",1,11
rachel,"Goodbye, baby.",1,11
paolo,"Ciao, bela.",1,11
ross,Do they wait for me to do this?,1,11
joey,So are you going to tell him?,1,11
ross,Why would I tell him?,1,11
joey,"How about Because if you don't, his mother might.",1,11
ross,Oh...,1,11
monica,What are you guys doing here?,1,11
joey,Uh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!,1,11
monica,...What did I ask?,1,11

monica,I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?,1,11
phoebe,"No.  No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?",1,11
monica,How would I know? I-I wasn't here.,1,11
phoebe,"Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!",1,11
chandler,Oh my God.,1,11
ross,you are my friend. I-I had to tell you.,1,11
chandler,I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?,1,11
ross,"Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drunk..uh...  I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.",1,11
chandler,What?,1,11
ross,"I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, you know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-",1,11
chandler,You knew about this?,1,11
joey,"Uh...you know, knowledge is a tricky thing.",1,11
chandler,"I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!",1,11
joey,"Hey, hey, hey, you are lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what would have happened.",1,11
ross,"Thanks, man, big help.",1,11
chandler,I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?,1,11
ross,"I wasn't- I mean, I-",1,11
chandler,"You know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.",1,11

rachel,Hey.,1,11
monica,"'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.",1,11
rachel,"Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?",1,11
monica,"Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.",1,11
phoebe,Hey Rach.,1,11
rachel,Hey.,1,11
phoebe,Hello.,1,11
monica,Hello.,1,11

monica,"No, you?",1,11
phoebe,"No, you?",1,11

phoebe,"Okay, maybe it was a trick question.  Um, Rachel can we do this now?",1,11
rachel,Okay.  I am so hot!,1,11
joey,"Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.",1,11
ross,I cannot believe we're having this conversation.,1,11
joey,"C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that is all.",1,11
rachel,Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.,1,11

ross,"Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you are still mad at me, I just want to say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.",1,11
chandler,"Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.",1,11
ross,"Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?",1,11
chandler,"Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!",1,11
ross,We're rehearsing a Greek play.,1,11
chandler,that is very funny. We done now?,1,11
ross,"No! Okay, you mean, you are not going to talk to her, you are not going to tell her how you feel?",1,11
chandler,"That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.",1,11
ross,"Okay, 'you' can't, or  you can't?  Okay, that is my finger.  that is, that is my knee.  Still doing the play. Ah!",1,11
phoebe,"Alright, what did you do with him?",1,11
monica,Oh! you are awake!,1,11

coma guy,I feel good! ...Who are you?,1,11
monica,"Oh, sorry.",1,11
phoebe,I'm Phoebe Buffay.,1,11

phoebe,"Well, we both have.",1,11
coma guy,"So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?",1,11
phoebe,"Well, actually it's just from me.",1,11
monica,I got you the foot massager.,1,11
phoebe,You know who shaved you? That was me.,1,11
monica,I read to you.,1,11
phoebe,I sang.  Hah!,1,11
coma guy,"Well,... thanks.",1,11
monica,"Oh, my pleasure.",1,11
phoebe,you are welcome.,1,11
coma guy,So. I guess I'll see you around.,1,11
phoebe,"What, that is it?",1,11
monica,"""See you around?""",1,11
coma guy,"Well, what do you want me to say?",1,11
monica,"Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, ""That was nice?"" Admit something to me? ""I'll call you?""",1,11
coma guy,"Alright, I'll call you.",1,11
phoebe,I don't think you mean that.,1,11
monica,"This is so typical. You know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, you know, it's just, you wake up, and ""See you around!"" Let's go, Phoebe.",1,11
phoebe,You know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.,1,11
mrs. bing,"Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?",1,11
chandler,"No, just knowing you are going to be there is enough.",1,11
mrs. bing,"Alright, well, be good, I love you.",1,11
chandler,You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.,1,11
mrs. bing,"O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.",1,11
chandler,Really stupid.,1,11
mrs. bing,"Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?",1,11
chandler,Yeah. No. No...,1,11
ross,"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.",1,11
joey,"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.",1,11
ross,you are kidding.,1,11
joey,"No, no. He said ""When are you going to grow up and start being a mom?""",1,11
ross,Wow!,1,11
joey,"Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you going to grow up and realise I have a bomb?""",1,11
ross,"Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say ""When are you going to grow up and realise I am your mom?""",1,11
joey,That makes more sense.,1,11
ross,"So, what's going on now?",1,11
joey,"I don't know, I've been standing here spelling it out for you!  I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.",1,11
ross,what do you see?,1,11
joey,"Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!",1,11
mrs. bing,"You okay, kiddo?",1,11

ross,Mrs. Bing.,1,11
mrs. bing,Mr. Geller.,1,11
chandler,Hey.,1,11
ross,You mean that?,1,11
chandler,"Yeah, why not.  So I told her.",1,11
ross,Yeah? How'd it go?,1,11
chandler,Awful. Awful. Could not have gone worse.,1,11
ross,"Well, how do you feel?",1,11
chandler,Pretty good! I told her.,1,11
ross,"Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, you know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh?  But.. we don't have to go down that road.",1,11
rachel,"Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.",1,11
monica,What's a 'niffle'?,1,11
joey,You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.,1,11
rachel,"Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...",1,11
ross,"Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell you, you don't want to be around when he starts writing with those!",1,11
rachel,"Alright, that is it! Give it back! that is it!",1,11
all,No!,1,11
chandler,"No-no-no-no, we're done.",1,12
monica,"Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna.  Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.",1,12
joey,"Ross, did you really read all these baby books?",1,12
ross,"Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!",1,12
phoebe,"Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.",1,12
chandler,"And, we're done with the yogurt.",1,12
phoebe,Sorry.,1,12
monica,"Aunt Syl, I did this as a favour, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?  Nice talk, Aunt Syl.  You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?",1,12
joey,"Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?  This is your baby.  Hi Daddy!",1,12
ross,Hello!,1,12
joey,How come you don't live with Mommy?  How come Mommy lives with that other lady?  What's a lesbian?,1,12
rachel,"Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos",1,12
paolo,"Ah, poke  a  nose, mmm",1,12
"joey, chandler, and ross","Mma, Mma, Mmaah",1,12

rachel,"Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.",1,12
phoebe,"Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!",1,12
monica,"Yeah, that is a big step.",1,12
rachel,I know...,1,12
chandler,"Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!",1,12
ross,"Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?",1,12
rachel,"I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...",1,12
ross,"...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration?  I could call immigration!",1,12
joey,"I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...",1,12
chandler,"Ok, you are going to have to stop that, forever!",1,12
joey,Need a new table.,1,12
chandler,You think?,1,12
carol,"Hey hey, come on in!",1,12
ross,"Hey, hello! mmwa!  I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.",1,12
carol,"Oh great! Is it vegetarian, Because Susan doesn't eat meat.",1,12

ross,"The sex?  Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...",1,12
carol,"The sex of the baby, Ross.",1,12
ross,"Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!",1,12
carol,Do you want to know?,1,12
ross,"No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!  Or isn't...",1,12
susan,"Oh, hello Ross!",1,12
ross,Susan...,1,12
susan,"So, so, did you hear?",1,12
ross,"Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!",1,12

carol,"Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...",1,12
ross,"Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!",1,12
susan,"Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?",1,12
carol,Mm-hmmm,1,12
ross,"Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?",1,12
carol and susan,It's a...,1,12
ross,"No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.",1,12
carol,"Well, thanks for the books.",1,12
ross,"No problem, ok, mmmwa  oh, mmmwa  Susan...",1,12
susan,"All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?",1,12
carol,Hello?,1,12
ross,"Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.",1,12
chandler,"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?",1,12
joey,that is the rule.,1,12
chandler,"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!",1,12
joey,How'd you get to that?,1,12
chandler,"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio",1,12
joey,You knew about that?,1,12
chandler,"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.",1,12
joey,"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?",1,12
chandler,"What do you mean, like, buy it together?",1,12
joey,Yeah,1,12
chandler,You think we're ready for something like that?,1,12
joey,Why not?,1,12
chandler,"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?",1,12
joey,"Why, are you moving out?",1,12
chandler,I'm not moving out.,1,12
joey,You'd tell me if you were moving out right,1,12
chandler,"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...",1,12
joey,"Aw, I know all about Kip!",1,12
chandler,"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.",1,12
joey,"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?",1,12
chandler,"Aw, don't do that",1,12
phoebe's assistant,We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4,1,12

phoebe,"Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.",1,12
paolo,"Uh, I am, uh, being naked?",1,12
phoebe,"Um, that is really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! you are being naked!",1,12
rachel,"I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....",1,12
monica,And Monica knows...,1,12
ross,"Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!",1,12
monica,"Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.",1,12

customer,"Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?",1,12

joey and chandler,Ooooohh!,1,12
ross,My God.,1,12
monica,Are you sure?,1,12
phoebe,"Oh yeah, I'm sure.  And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.",1,12
monica,Was it...?,1,12
phoebe,"Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.",1,12

ross,The actress!,1,12
ross,Thanks Rach.,1,12
chandler,So what are you going to do?,1,12

chandler,"Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.",1,12
joey,Feminist issue. that is where I went!,1,12
phoebe,She is going to hate me.,1,12
ross,"Yeah, well...",1,12
joey,"Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?",1,12
chandler,that is patio furniture!,1,12
joey,"So what, like people are going to come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!",1,12
chandler,What about the birds?,1,12
joey,"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something.""",1,12
chandler,You pick one.,1,12
joey,"All right, how about the ladybugs?",1,12
chandler,"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!",1,12
joey,"Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!",1,12
chandler,"Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!",1,12
phoebe,Hey!,1,12
rachel,Hi Pheebs!,1,12

rachel,"No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.",1,12

phoebe,"Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,",1,12
rachel,"Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...",1,12
phoebe,"Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.",1,12
rachel,"Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!",1,12
phoebe,"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies",1,12
rachel,"All right, well, you are right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.",1,12
phoebe,Which proves that I never lie.,1,12
rachel,I guess you don't.,1,12
phoebe,Paolo made a pass at me.,1,12
chandler,"So, what do you think?",1,12
ross,I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.,1,12
chandler,I know!,1,12
monica,"So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?",1,12
joey,"Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!",1,12
monica,Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!,1,12
phoebe,Are you okay?,1,12
rachel,I need some milk.,1,12
phoebe,"Ok, I've got milk  Here you go...  Oh! Better?",1,12
rachel,"No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all ""Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..."" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!",1,12
phoebe,"I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!",1,12
rachel,"Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!",1,12
rachel and phoebe,I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!,1,12
phoebe,"No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?",1,12
rachel,"I don't know...right, he's the pig!",1,12
phoebe,Such a pig!,1,12
rachel,"Oh, God, he's such a pig,",1,12
phoebe,Oh he's like a...,1,12
rachel,He's like a big disgusting...,1,12
phoebe,...like a...,1,12
rachel,...pig...pig man!,1,12
phoebe,"Yes, good! Ok...",1,12
rachel,"Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?",1,12
phoebe,"Oh! I know!  It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...",1,12
rachel,"Ok, Ok, Pheebs...",1,12
phoebe,The end.,1,12
rachel,"Oh, God...",1,12
phoebe,Should I not have told you?,1,12
rachel,"No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...",1,12
phoebe,"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",1,12
monica,We should get over there and see if she's okay.  Just one...second! Score!  Game! Come on.,1,12
ross,"Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.",1,12
joey,"No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.",1,12
ross,"Come on, two on one.",1,12
chandler,"What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!",1,12
ross,"What, now?",1,12
joey,"Yes, now is when you swoop! You got to make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's got to know that you are everything he's not! you are like, like the anti-Paolo!",1,12
chandler,"My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. you are there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!",1,12
paolo,"No, that is cold, that is cold, that is...",1,12
ross,How's it going?,1,12
monica,"Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, ""How could you?"" or, ""Enormous breasts!"" Here he comes!",1,12
phoebe,Ooh!,1,12
paolo,"Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.",1,12
phoebe,"Oh, ok bye-bye.",1,12
monica,"Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel,  but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.",1,12
paolo,Grazie.,1,12
ross,"Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...",1,12
phoebe,"Oh, just look at her...",1,12
ross,"Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...",1,12
monica,"Oh, you are right.",1,12
ross,...and I really think it should be me.,1,12
ross,Hey.,1,12
rachel,Hey.,1,12
ross,You all right?,1,12
rachel,"Ooh, I've been better...",1,12
ross,"Come here.  Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.",1,12
rachel,"Oh, Ross...",1,12
ross,What?,1,12
rachel,"I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.",1,12
ross,Huh.,1,12
rachel,"Oh Ross, you are so great!",1,12
ross,oh,1,12
monica,"Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?",1,12
rachel,Oh...,1,12
phoebe,You ok?,1,12
rachel,...medium...hmm...any cookies left?,1,12
phoebe,Yep!,1,12
ross,"See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.",1,12
rachel,"No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want",1,12
ross,"Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.",1,12
rachel,"No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.",1,12
ross,What?,1,12
rachel,What?,1,12
ross,"I-I'm, I'm having a boy?",1,12
rachel,"Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you are not having a boy.",1,12
ross,"What-I'm having, I'm having a boy!  Huh, am I having a boy?",1,12
rachel monica phoebe,"Yes, you are having a boy!",1,12
ross,"I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!",1,12
chandler,What-,1,12
joey,What-,1,12
joey and chandler,What is it?,1,12
ross,I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!,1,12
joey,Hey!,1,12
chandler,Hey!,1,12
joey and chandler,We already knew that!,1,12
ross,I'm having a son. Um...,1,12
monica,Yes! And that would be a shut-down!,1,12
joey and chandler,Shut-out!!,1,12
monica,"Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!",1,12
joey,"Uh, it's 2",1,12
chandler,"Yeah, get out!",1,12
monica,"You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies!  All right, ok, I got to go. I'm going,  and I'm gone.",1,12
chandler,One more game?,1,12
joey,Oh yeah!,1,12
rachel,"That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock",1,13
chandler,I'm sorry!,1,13
rachel,You have no respect for anybody's privacy!,1,13
chandler,"Rachel, wait, wait.",1,13
rachel,"No, you wait! This is ridiculous!",1,13
chandler,Can I just say one thing?,1,13
rachel,What? What?!,1,13
chandler,that is a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.,1,13
rachel,Oh!!,1,13
phoebe,"Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. You know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.",1,13
roger,that is pretty much it.,1,13
phoebe,Oops!,1,13
roger,"But you tell it really well, sweetie.",1,13
phoebe,"Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.",1,13
roger,Okay. I'll miss you.,1,13
phoebe,Isn't he great?,1,13
rachel,He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.,1,13
phoebe,"I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky,you know?",1,13
monica,"So, you think you'll do it on his couch?",1,13
phoebe,"Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that is a little weird, you know? Vinyl.",1,13
rachel,Okay.  Any of you guys want anything else?,1,13
chandler,"Oh, yes, could I have one of those.",1,13
rachel,"No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?",1,13
chandler,Okay.,1,13
roger,"Did I, uh, did I miss something?",1,13
chandler,"No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.",1,13
ross,You what? What what were you doing seeing her boobies?,1,13
chandler,It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.,1,13
rachel,"Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?",1,13
phoebe,"Yeah, because hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.",1,13
rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.",1,13
chandler,"You know, I don't know why you are so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.",1,13
rachel,"Nice? They were nice. I mean, that is it? I mean, mittens are nice.",1,13
chandler,"Okay,  rock, hard place, me.",1,13
roger,you are so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't want to be there when when the laughter stops.,1,13
chandler,"Whoah woah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?",1,13
roger,"Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. You know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.",1,13
chandler,Huh.,1,13
roger,"I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.",1,13
chandler,"Uhuh, how did you know that?",1,13
roger,It's textbook.,1,13
joey,"Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?",1,13
all,"Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!",1,13
monica,"Hey, how long are you in the city?",1,13
mr. tribbiani,Just for a couple of days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.  I don't know this one.,1,13
phoebe,"Oh, this is my friend Roger.",1,13
roger,Hi.,1,13
mr. tribbiani,"Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.",1,13
roger,"You too, sir.",1,13
mr. tribbiani,"What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?",1,13
joey,"Dad, dad.",1,13
mr. tribbiani,"Oh, 'excuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife?  Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!",1,13
mr. tribbiani,"Got to go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now",1,13
joey,"Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?",1,13
mr. tribbiani,Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.,1,13
joey,Sure. So how long you been...,1,13
mr. tribbiani,"Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?",1,13
joey,Since then?!,1,13
mr. tribbiani,"No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. You ever been in love?",1,13
joey,...I would know.,1,13
mr. tribbiani,Then you have not. you are burning your tomatoes.,1,13
joey,you are one to talk.,1,13
mr. tribbiani,"Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.",1,13
joey,Oh man. Please tell me one of them is Ma.,1,13
mr. tribbiani,"Of course, course one of them is Ma. What's the matter with you.",1,13
joey,"It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!",1,13
rachel,"I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  Why do they have to become people? Why do they have...  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?",1,13
chandler,What?  What?,1,13
rachel,Did you not get a good enough look the other day?,1,13
ross,"Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you are going to have to show her your peepee.",1,13
chandler,"You know, I don't see that happening?",1,13
rachel,"C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.",1,13
chandler,Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.',1,13
monica,Hello?,1,13
phoebe,It's Phoebe.,1,13
roger,And Rog.,1,13
monica,C'mon up.,1,13
chandler,"Oh, good. Rog is here.",1,13
joey,What's the matter with Rog?,1,13
ross,Yeah.,1,13
chandler,"Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.",1,13
ross,"What, so he was a little analytical. that is what he does, you know? C'mon, he's not that bad.",1,13
ross,"You see, that is where you are wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level that that she was a lesbian?",1,13
roger,I don't know. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.,1,13
ross,Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?,1,13
roger,"I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...",1,13
monica,"Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.",1,13
roger,"Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.",1,13
ross,That that is ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!,1,13
monica,Oh! So you think I'm a failure!,1,13
phoebe,Isn't he good?,1,13
ross,"No no no, that that is not what I was saying...",1,13
monica,"You know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!",1,13
ross,"Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!",1,13
rachel,"you are right! I mean you are right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.",1,13
roger,"that is tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're going to catch that movie, we got to get going.",1,13
phoebe,"Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?",1,13
roger,"Geez, we're going to be late, sweetie...",1,13
phoebe,"Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.",1,13
monica,you are welcome.,1,13
roger,"Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.",1,13
monica,Hate that guy!,1,13
joey,"Night, you guys.",1,13
chandler,"Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.",1,13
joey,"Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?",1,13
ronni,"Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.",1,13
joey,I'm Joey Tribbiani.,1,13
ronni,"Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you are so much cuter than your pictures!  I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?",1,13
chandler,"Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, you know?",1,13
ronni,"Now, you see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want them sort of laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.",1,13
chandler,"Joey, if I go first, I want to be looking for my keys.",1,13
ronni,that is a good one!,1,13
mr. tribbiani,"Hey, Joe.",1,13
joey,"Dad, Ronni's here.",1,13
mr. tribbiani,Huh?,1,13
ronni,Hi.,1,13
mr. tribbiani,"Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?",1,13
ronni,"Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.",1,13
mr. tribbiani,Thank you. Uh...,1,13
chandler,"So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?",1,13
ronni,"Look, I uh, I should not have come. I-I'd better get going, I don't want to miss the last train.",1,13
mr. tribbiani,I don't want you taking that thing.,1,13
ronni,"Oh, where am I going to stay, here?",1,13
joey,Who-ah-ho.,1,13
mr. tribbiani,We will go to a hotel.,1,13
ronni,We will go to a hotel.,1,13
joey,No you won't.,1,13
ronni,No we won't.,1,13
joey,If you go to a hotel you will be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.,1,13
mr. tribbiani,you are going to keep an eye on us?,1,13
joey,"that is right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you are under my roof you are going to live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.",1,13
ronni,Wow. He is strict.,1,13
joey,"Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.",1,13
ronni,"Thanks. you are, uh, you are a good kid.",1,13
chandler,"Come on, I will show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by ""No thanks, it's late.""",1,13
joey,"Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you got to make a change. This has gone on long enough.",1,13
mr. tribbiani,What kind of change?,1,13
joey,"Well, either you break it off with Ronni",1,13
mr. tribbiani,I can't do that!,1,13
joey,Then you got to come clean with Ma! This is not right!,1,13
mr. tribbiani,"Yeah, but this is",1,13
joey,I don't want to hear it! Now go to my room!,1,13
chandler,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?",1,13
joey,Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.,1,13
chandler,"Well, you are going to.",1,13
joey,"I've been thinking. You know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...",1,13
chandler,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?",1,13
joey,"You know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, you know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...",1,13
chandler,"Hey, you are not him. you are you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?",1,13
joey,No.,1,13
chandler,"No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married.""",1,13
joey,You really think so?,1,13
chandler,Yeah. I really do.,1,13
joey,"Thanks, Chandler.",1,13
chandler,Get off!,1,13
ronni,Hi.,1,13
monica,Hi...May I help you?,1,13
ronni,"Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?",1,13
monica,Okay...who are you?,1,13
ronni,"Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?",1,13
monica,"Oh, c'mon in.",1,13
ronni,Thanks.,1,13
rachel,"Hi, I'm Rachel.",1,13
ronni,Hi.,1,13
rachel,Bathroom's up there.,1,13
ronni,Great.,1,13
rachel,"Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?",1,13
ronni,"Oh, like, uh, five minutes?",1,13
rachel,"Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time.  Hey, Mr. Trib.",1,13
mr. tribbiani,"Hey. Morning, dear.",1,13
rachel,Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.,1,13
joey,What's the matter with you?!,1,13
rachel,I thought it was Chandler!,1,13
chandler,What? What?,1,13
rachel,You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!,1,13
chandler,"Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.",1,13
all,"Hey, Pheebs.",1,13
phoebe,Hey.,1,13
monica,How's it going?,1,13
phoebe,Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.,1,13
phoebe,So what's going on?,1,13
monica,"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.",1,13
ross,"I don't know, there's just something about...",1,13
chandler,Basically we just feel that he's...,1,13
rachel,We hate that guy.,1,13
all,Yeah. Hate him.,1,13
ross,"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.",1,13
phoebe,"Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?",1,13
all,"...No, we hate him.",1,13
rachel,We're sorry.,1,13
joey,Ma! What're you doing here?,1,13
mrs. tribbiani,I came to give you this  and this.,1,13
joey,Oww! Big ring!,1,13
mrs. tribbiani,"Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.",1,13
joey,"Hold on, you-you knew?",1,13
mrs. tribbiani,"Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. ""I'm sleeping over at my accountant's,"" I mean, what is that? Please!",1,13
joey,"So then how could you I mean, how could you?!",1,13
mrs. tribbiani,"Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.",1,13
joey,"Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?",1,13
mrs. tribbiani,"Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.",1,13
joey,I'm...happy...for you?,1,13
mrs. tribbiani,"Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.",1,13
joey,"Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.",1,13
mrs. tribbiani,"I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?",1,13
joey,Yeah. you are ten times prettier than she is.,1,13
mrs. tribbiani,that is sweet. Could I take her?,1,13
joey,With this ring?  No contest.,1,13
roger,"What's wrong, sweetie?",1,13
phoebe,"Nothing, nothing.",1,13
roger,"Ah, what's wrong, c'mon.",1,13
phoebe,"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.",1,13
roger,Oh. They don't.,1,13
phoebe,But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you are a little...,1,13
roger,What?,1,13
phoebe,Intense and creepy.,1,13
roger,Oh.,1,13
phoebe,"But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",1,13
roger,"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",1,13
phoebe,"you are not? See, that is why you are so great!",1,13
roger,"Actually it's, it's quite, you know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. You know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you are like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.",1,13
monica,"So you talked to your dad, huh.",1,13
joey,"Yeah. He's going to keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's going to keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.",1,13
rachel,Wow.,1,13
chandler,Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.,1,13
ross,"So Joey, you okay?",1,13
joey,"Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you got to let go. Even if you know better, you've got to let them make their own mistakes.",1,13
rachel,"Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.",1,13
chandler,"If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.",1,13
phoebe,Hey.,1,13
all,"Hey, Pheebs.",1,13
monica,How's it going?,1,13
phoebe,"Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.",1,13
all,Aww.,1,13
phoebe,"Yeah, right.",1,13
all,Aww!!,1,13
rachel,What happened?,1,13
phoebe,"I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!",1,13
phoebe,"Hey, Joey. What's going on?",1,13
joey,Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop,1,13
monica,Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!,1,13
joey,Sorry. Wrong boobies.,1,13
monica,"Hello, Joey.",1,13
mr. tribbiani,"Oh! ...Hello, dear.",1,13
joey,"I'm telling' you Ross, she wants you.",1,14
ross,She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.,1,14
chandler,Any contact?,1,14
ross,She lent me an egg once.,1,14
joey,you are in!,1,14
ross,"Aw, right.",1,14
woman,"Hi, Ross.",1,14
ross,Hey.,1,14
chandler,"Come on, Ross, you got to get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't think we need a third...",1,14
joey,"Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.",1,14
ross,An egg?,1,14
joey,"Yeah, you are going to go up to her and say, ""Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg.""",1,14
chandler,I think it's winning.,1,14
ross,I think it's insane.,1,14
chandler,"She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.",1,14
joey,Think it'll work?,1,14
chandler,"No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.",1,14
monica,You can not do this.,1,14
rachel,"Do what, do what?",1,14
monica,Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.,1,14
rachel,No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?,1,14
phoebe,"Because he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!",1,14
monica,"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.",1,14
rachel,"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?",1,14
joey,"Actually, tomorrow night kind of depends on how tonight goes.",1,14
chandler,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...",1,14
joey,"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's going out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.",1,14
chandler,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...",1,14
joey,"Pathetic mess? I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinking', cha-ching!  Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. you are doin' this.",1,14
ross,Hi. She said yes.,1,14
chandler,"Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?",1,14
joey,How do I look?,1,14
chandler,"Oh, uh, I... don't... care.  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.",1,14
lorraine,"Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.",1,14
chandler,...And what did you bring?,1,14
lorraine,"She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm going to go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.",1,14
chandler,Janice?,1,14
janice,Oh.... my.... God.,1,14
chandler,"Hey, it's Janice.",1,14
chandler,"Ok, I'm making' a break for it, I'm going' out the window.",1,14
joey,"No, no, no, don't! I've been waiting' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.",1,14
chandler,Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!,1,14
joey,"Can you stop yelling'? you are making' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.",1,14
chandler,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you are right.  Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!",1,14
rachel,"Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.",1,14
monica,Which one was Pete Carney?,1,14
rachel,"Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.  ""Was it good for you?""",1,14
monica,"Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy.  ""I win! I win!"" I went out with the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once.",1,14
rachel,How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!,1,14
monica,I don't know. Maybe we're some kind of magnets.,1,14
phoebe,I know I am. that is why I can't wear a digital watch.,1,14
monica,"There's more beer, right?",1,14
phoebe,"Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.",1,14
rachel,"Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.",1,14
phoebe,"Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.",1,14
monica,"Ok, well, what kind of ritual?",1,14
phoebe,"Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.",1,14
rachel,Or?,1,14
phoebe,"Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.",1,14
monica,Burning's good.,1,14
rachel,"Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.",1,14
lorraine,"You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.",1,14
joey,"Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?",1,14
janice,"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.",1,14
chandler,that is OK.,1,14
janice,"Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theatre of cruelty.",1,14
joey,We can't do that.,1,14
chandler,What? What can't you do?,1,14
joey,"Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?",1,14
joey,"Uh, we might be leaving now.",1,14
chandler,"Tell me it's ""you and me"" we.",1,14
joey,"She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.",1,14
chandler,"Ok, you can not do this to me.",1,14
joey,"you are right, I'm sorry. you are right.",1,14
lorraine,"Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?",1,14
joey,"I'm out of here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.",1,14
chandler,I hope she throws up on you.,1,14
chandler,So..,1,14
janice,Just us.,1,14
chandler,"Oh, what a crappy night!",1,14
janice,"Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been sticking' out of your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.",1,14
chandler,Excuse me.  How you doin'?,1,14
janice,"So, do we have the best friends or what?",1,14
chandler,Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?,1,14
janice,I will go for that drink.,1,14
chandler,You got it. Good woman!  Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?,1,14
janice,Each.,1,14
chandler,"that is right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy.  I've always wanted to know...",1,14
janice,Happy Valentine's Day!,1,14
janice,"Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?",1,14
chandler,"No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.",1,14
janice,Kiss me!,1,14
monica,"Oh, Chandler, sorry.",1,14
monica,"oh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.",1,14
janice,"Hi, Monica.",1,14
chandler,"Ok, well, this was very special.",1,14
monica,"Rach, come see who's out here!",1,14
rachel,"Oh my god. Janice, hi!",1,14
chandler,Janice is going to go away now.,1,14
monica,I'll be right back.,1,14
rachel,"Oh, Joey, look who it is.",1,14
joey,Whoa.,1,14
chandler,"Oh, good, Joey's home now.",1,14
janice,This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.,1,14
monica,"Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to.  He just happened to call.",1,14
janice,"Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?",1,14
ross,"I'm just saying' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.",1,14
kristin,that is funny. Who are they?,1,14
ross,"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.",1,14
kristin,You mean they're lovers.,1,14
ross,If you want to put a label on it.,1,14
kristin,"Wow, uh, anything else I should know?",1,14
ross,"Nope, nope, that is it.",1,14
ross,"Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part.  Hello!",1,14
phoebe,"Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.",1,14
monica,"All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.",1,14
phoebe,"Um, that is ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.",1,14
rachel,"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.",1,14
monica,Can we just start throwing things in?,1,14
phoebe,"Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK.",1,14
rachel,"Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.",1,14
phoebe,"Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.",1,14
monica,"Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.",1,14
rachel,Hey he's wearing a sweater.,1,14
monica,No.,1,14
rachel and phoebe,Eww!,1,14
rachel,And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.,1,14
monica,"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...",1,14
chandler,How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?,1,14
joey,I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.,1,14
chandler,"Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.",1,14
janice,"Hello, funny Valentine.",1,14
chandler,"Hi, Just Janice.",1,14
janice,"Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm going to!",1,14
joey,"If you don't do it, I will.",1,14
ross,"So, um, what do you do for a living?",1,14
kristin,"Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.",1,14
carol,Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.,1,14
susan,I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.,1,14
ross,"Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? Because she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.",1,14
kristin,I guess.,1,14
ross,Are you sure? Great. Carol? want to come over and join us?,1,14
carol,"Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.",1,14
ross,"Come on. These people will scooch down. You guys will scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!",1,14
fireman no. 1,What do we got there?,1,14
fireman no. 2,A piece of something,1,14
monica,"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.",1,14
fireman no. 3,It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.,1,14
fireman no. 1,you are our third call tonight.,1,14
rachel,Really?,1,14
fireman no. 2,"Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.",1,14
janice,I brought you something.,1,14
chandler,"Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts.  Chan and Jan Forever.",1,14
janice,I had them made special.,1,14
chandler,"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are going to work out.",1,14
janice,that is fine.,1,14
chandler,It is?,1,14
janice,Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.,1,14
chandler,"Oh no, you see, actually it is.",1,14
janice,"No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.",1,14
chandler,"Oh, no I don't.",1,14
janice,Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?,1,14
chandler,"I did, but...",1,14
janice,"You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See you.",1,14
chandler,Call me!,1,14
carol,It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.,1,14
ross,"You did so. I swear, I swear— How long has she been in the bathroom?",1,14
carol,"Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.",1,14
ross,Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.,1,14
carol,That could be it.,1,14
ross,"Oh, god.  You know, this is still pretty hot.",1,14
carol,"Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that is not funny",1,14
ross,"No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life"" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that is it. And um, and then I'm here talking' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No  no, I know what you are going to say, you are a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you are carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep saying' that, but there's something' right here. I love you.",1,14
carol,"Oh, I love you too. But...",1,14
ross,"No but, no but.",1,14
carol,"You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.",1,14
ross,"that is easy for you to say, you found one already.",1,14
carol,All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.,1,14
carol,Not her.,1,14
fireman no. 3,"We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?",1,14
rachel,"So, um, will you bring the truck?",1,14
fireman no. 3,I'll even let you ring the bell.,1,14
rachel,"Oh, my god.",1,14
phoebe,"See, there you go, the cleansing works!",1,14
monica,They're nice guys.,1,14

rachel,Oh! that is why.  I'm sorry!,1,15
woman,Chandler.,1,15
chandler,"Mrs. Tedlock. you are looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.",1,15
mrs. tedlock,"Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.",1,15
chandler,"Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really.  Nothing.",1,15
phoebe,"Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...",1,15
chandler,Hey!,1,15
all,Hey!,1,15
phoebe,Never mind. But it was going to be really good.,1,15
ross,What's going on?,1,15
all,What is it?,1,15
chandler,"So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.",1,15
all,that is great!,1,15
chandler,So.... I quit.,1,15
all,Why?,1,15
chandler,Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!,1,15
monica,"Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.",1,15
chandler,"If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.",1,15
phoebe,So was it a lot more money?,1,15
chandler,It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that is in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.,1,15
rachel,... the WENUS?,1,15
chandler,Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.,1,15
rachel,Oh. That WENUS.,1,15
joey,So what're you going to do?,1,15
chandler,I don't know. that is the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.,1,15
phoebe,"Ooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve?  Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.",1,15
monica,Um... hi there.,1,15
phoebe,"Hi!  Oh, yeah, no, I know. you are a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....",1,15
chandler,Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.,1,15
phoebe,"Yeah, yeah!",1,15
monica,"Well, what kind of food is he looking for?",1,15
phoebe,"Well, he wants to do some eclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.",1,15
monica,Oh my God!,1,15
phoebe,"Yeah, I know!  So, what do you think?",1,15
chandler,"Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.",1,15
phoebe,OK.  Oh Monica! Guess what!,1,15
chandler,Can you see my nipples through this shirt?,1,15
rachel,"No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.",1,15
phoebe,"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?",1,15
chandler,"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the ""a-gogo.""",1,15
rachel,Career counselor?,1,15
chandler,"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.",1,15
rachel,I don't!,1,15
chandler,"Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.",1,15
ross,"Ah, the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech.",1,15
monica,"Oh, I love my life, I love my life!",1,15
phoebe,Ooh! Brian's Song!,1,15
rachel,The meeting with the guy went great?,1,15
monica,"So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.",1,15
chandler,Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?,1,15
monica,"So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.",1,15
rachel,What are you going to make?,1,15
phoebe,Yummy noises.,1,15
rachel,"And Monica, what are you going to make?",1,15
monica,I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!,1,15
phoebe,"Ooh! I know what you could make!  I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff?  You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.",1,15
ross,"Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighbourhood?",1,15
joey,"How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.",1,15
ross,"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you are not dating a puma?",1,15
chandler,Who are you going out with?,1,15
phoebe,"Oh, is this the bug lady?",1,15
rachel,"Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.",1,15
ross,Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.,1,15
rachel,So what are you guys going to do?,1,15
ross,"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.",1,15
chandler,And he's not speaking metaphorically.,1,15
joey,"So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...  huh-huh?",1,15
ross,"Well, I don't know....  huh-huh.... but I'm hoping  huh-huh.",1,15
joey,"I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.",1,15
ross,"Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...",1,15
celia,I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...,1,15
ross,Alright...,1,15
monica,"OK, try this salmon mousse.",1,15
joey,Mmm. Good.,1,15
monica,Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,1,15
joey,It's creamier.,1,15
monica,"Yeah, well, is that better?",1,15
joey,"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, you know?",1,15
rachel,My God! What happened to you?,1,15
chandler,"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  ""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",1,15
phoebe,that is so great! Because you already know how to do that!,1,15
chandler,"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.",1,15
rachel,"Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!",1,15
monica,"Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.",1,15
chandler,"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",1,15
monica,It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.,1,15
chandler,Well.... it is amouz-ing...,1,15
monica,"Hello?  Oh, hi Wendy!  Yeah, eight o'clock.  What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?...  OK, great.  All right, I'll see you then. Bye.",1,15
phoebe,Ten dollars an hour for what?,1,15
monica,"Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.",1,15
rachel,Waitressing?,1,15
joey,Uh-oh.,1,15
monica,Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...,1,15
rachel,"But, but?",1,15
monica,"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.",1,15
rachel,Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.,1,15
chandler,"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.  Amouz-bouche?",1,15
celia,Talk to me.,1,15
ross,"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...",1,15
celia,No no no. Talk... dirty.,1,15
ross,"What... what, here?",1,15
celia,Yes...,1,15
ross,Ah....,1,15
celia,Say something..... hot.,1,15
ross,Er.... um.....,1,15
celia,What?,1,15
ross,Um... uh.... vulva.,1,15
joey,Vulva?,1,15
ross,"Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.",1,15
joey,Whoa!! You cuddled? How many times??,1,15
ross,"Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?",1,15
joey,What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.,1,15
ross,Please be kidding.,1,15
joey,"Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.",1,15
ross,OK.  I'm in my apartment...,1,15
joey,....yeah... what else?,1,15
ross,"that is it. I'm in my apartment, you are not there, we're not having this conversation.",1,15
joey,"Alright, look, I'll start, OK?",1,15
ross,"Joey, please.",1,15
joey,"Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look!  Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.",1,15
ross,Wow.,1,15
joey,"Alright, now you say something.",1,15
ross,I... ahem... I really don't think so.,1,15
joey,"Come on! You like this woman, right?",1,15
ross,Yeah.,1,15
joey,"You want to see her again, right?",1,15
ross,Sure.,1,15
joey,"Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!",1,15
ross,"OK, turn around.  I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.",1,15
joey,"Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.",1,15
ross,"Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.",1,15
joey,There you go! Keep going. Keep going!,1,15
ross,"I, er...",1,15
ross,I want to take my tongue... and...,1,15
ross,....and....,1,15
joey,Say it... say it!,1,15
ross,...run it all over your body until you are... trembling with... with...,1,15
chandler,....with??,1,15
ross,Funny story!,1,15
joey,you are not going to believe this!,1,15
chandler,It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.,1,15
joey,"Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.",1,15
chandler,Again?,1,15
joey,"And again, and again, and again...  Hello?  And again.",1,15
chandler,"Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?  Yeah, I miss you too.  Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?  Well, that is very generous  er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that is more than a job. I need something I can really care about....  And that is on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?  Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!  No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy!  I'll see you on Monday!",1,15
chandler,Well?,1,15

phoebe,OK.,1,15
chandler,"This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?",1,15
chandler,"Thank you Helen, that'll be all.",1,15
chandler,"Last time I do that, I promise.",1,15
monica,"Wendy, we had a deal!  Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!",1,15

rachel,"OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.",1,15
steve,Is it dry in here?,1,15
rachel,"Let me, let me get you some wine!",1,15

steve,"Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!",1,15
monica,I'm so glad you liked them!,1,15
steve,Like them? I could eat a hundred of them!,1,15
monica,"Oh, well... um, that is all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.",1,15
steve,Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.,1,15
rachel,Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?,1,15
steve,"You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.",1,15

monica,You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.,1,15

steve,"Alright, we'll share.",1,15
monica,"No, give me the...",1,15
steve,"Well then you can't have any.  Bear overboard! I think he's drowning.  Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself!  ""Help!  I'm drowning!  Help!""",1,15
monica,that is it! Dinner is over!,1,15
steve,What?,1,15
monica,What?,1,15
steve,Why?,1,15
monica,"Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?",1,15
steve,Hey!,1,15
joey,What a tool!,1,15
rachel,You don't want to work for a guy like that.,1,15
ross,Yeah!,1,15

ross,"Oh, I was unbelievable.",1,15
joey,"All right, Ross!",1,15

joey,Whoa! And the...  huh-huh?,1,15
ross,"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kind of late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...",1,15

rachel,"No, yeah, I’ve done that.",1,16
ross,"And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.",1,16
rachel,I’ve never done that.,1,16
chandler,"All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly like her sister.",1,16

mr. douglas,She’s still here.,1,16

chandler,"And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.",1,16
mr. douglas,You’re kidding? She seems so...,1,16
chandler,"Oh, no, no. Nina...  ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.",1,16
mr. douglas,That’s unbelievable.,1,16
chandler,"And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.",1,16
mr. douglas,I see. I guess you never really know what’s going’ on inside a person’s head.,1,16
chandler,"Well, I guess that’s why they call it psychology, sir.",1,16
soothing male voice,"..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.",1,16
teacher,Lights please? And that’s having a baby. Next week is our final class.,1,16
ross,"Susan, go deep.",1,16
carol,This is impossible. It’s just impossible.,1,16

carol,"What that woman... did. I am not doin’ that. It’s just going to have to stay in, that’s all, everything will be the same, it’ll just stay in.",1,16
ross,"Carol, honey, shh, shh, everything’s going to be alright.",1,16
carol,"Oh, what do you know?  No one's going up to you and saying, ""Hi, is that your nostril?  Mind if we push this pot roast through it?""",1,16
susan,"Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.",1,16
susan,"I know it’s frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when it’s over, we’re all going to be parents for the rest of our lives.",1,16
susan,"I mean, that’s what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?",1,16

rachel,"Oh, you’re going to be great!",1,16
ross,"Aw, how can you say that? I can’t even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I going to raise a kid?",1,16
chandler,"You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.",1,16

joey,"You meant sex, right?",1,16
nina,Do you have a sec?,1,16
chandler,"Ah, sure, Nina. What’s up?",1,16
nina,"I don’t know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.",1,16
chandler,"Oh, well, ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous, of us.",1,16
nina,Maybe. But that doesn’t explain why they keep taking my scissors.,1,16
chandler,"Ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big raise.",1,16
nina,I am?,1,16
chandler,"Sure, why not?",1,16
nina,Oh my god!  You’re amazing!,1,16
chandler,"Oh, you don’t know.  Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?",1,16
helen,So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?,1,16
nina,What?,1,16
chandler,Helen drinks.  Will you marry me?,1,16
chandler,"Well, I ended up telling her everything.",1,16
rachel,"Oh, how’d she take it?",1,16
chandler,Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing.  Little tip,1,16
monica,"Okay, I think I get how to do this.",1,16

rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he’s going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?",1,16
phoebe,"Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I’m not saying she’s like evil or anything. She just, you know, she’s always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn’t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?",1,16
monica and rachel,No.,1,16
phoebe,"Well, but that’s what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn’t even talk to me any more. Because he said he didn’t want to be around... anything that looked like either one of us.",1,16
rachel,"Oh... Oh, Pheebs.",1,16
phoebe,"I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...",1,16

ross,"Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?",1,17
mr. geller,"Oh, well, I, I guess it must have been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that is when I knew.",1,17

phoebe,"Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.",1,18
joey,What?,1,18
phoebe,"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.",1,18
chandler,"that is alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break them up with a movie.",1,18
ross,"Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...",1,18
rachel,"Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.",1,18
monica,"You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.",1,18
rachel,"Hmm. kind of stepped on my point there, Mon.",1,18
ross,"So, you gals want to hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.",1,18
rachel,"ooh, that is fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.",1,18

rachel,"OK, OK, it's my turn.",1,18
chandler,Go.,1,18
ross,Uh.... bean! Bean!,1,18
joey,The Unbearable Likeness of Being!,1,18
rachel,Yes!,1,18

rachel,"Okay, okay, I checked. We have",1,19
monica,"Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.",1,19
rachel,"Thank you.  Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!",1,19
monica,Oh good! Because where else would we get any?,1,19
rachel,Oh. Right. ...Oh great.,1,19
monica,What is it?,1,19
rachel,"Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!",1,19
monica,Barry who you almost...?,1,19
rachel,Barry who I almost.,1,19
monica,"And Mindy, your maid of...?",1,19
rachel,"Mindy, my maid of. Oh!",1,19
monica,"that is Mindy? Wow, she is pretty.  Lucky. To have had a friend like you.",1,19
ross,"Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. Come here, give me the rice.  Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'.  'Bring me the' and- Rach?",1,19
rachel,What?,1,19
ross,Hi.,1,19
rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.",1,19
ross,Really.,1,19
rachel,"No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.",1,19
ross,"Woah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?",1,19
rachel,"Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, you know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that is all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...",1,19
ross,"Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.",1,19
rachel,"Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? You know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?",1,19
ross,"Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...",1,19
monica,Hi.,1,19
ross,...Gets interrupted. Hi!,1,19
rachel,"Hi, how was the movie?",1,19
monica,Wonderful!,1,19
phoebe,So good!,1,19
joey,Suck-fest.,1,19
chandler,Total chick-flick.,1,19
phoebe,"I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, you know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...",1,19
joey,"Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.",1,19
monica,There was nudity!,1,19
joey,I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.,1,19
monica and phoebe,Hugh! Hugh Grant!,1,19
ross,"Alright, I've got to go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're going to go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.",1,19
chandler,"They're still just friends, right?",1,19
rachel,And I will see you tomorrow!,1,19
ross,"that is right, you are going to spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.",1,19
monica,"Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?",1,19
ross,"Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. you are not even going to be there.",1,19
chandler,I can't believe we are even having this discussion.,1,19
joey,"I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.",1,19
chandler,"I mean, don't you think if things were going to happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?",1,19
ross,"I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.",1,19
joey,She really said that?,1,19
ross,"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is going to be there tonight.",1,19
joey,'Tonight' tonight?,1,19
ross,"Well, I think it's perfect. You know, it's just going to be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...",1,19
chandler,I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.,1,19
ross,"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.",1,19
chandler,"Hey,you know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.",1,19
rachel,"Now, now the one in the feather boa, that is Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay-  Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you are not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?  Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh!  Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that.  Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because-  Marcel? Marc-",1,19
joey,How could you lose him?,1,19
rachel,"I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-",1,19
monica,Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?,1,19
rachel,I don't know. The left one.,1,19
monica,Which ones?,1,19
rachel,"Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.",1,19
phoebe,Hey.,1,19
all,Hi.,1,19
phoebe,"Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?",1,19
chandler,Rachel lost Marcel.,1,19
phoebe,"Oh no, how?",1,19
monica,He- he pooped in my shoe.,1,19
phoebe,Which one?,1,19
monica,Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.,1,19
phoebe,"No, which one? The right or left? Because the left one is lucky...",1,19
rachel,"C'mon, you guys, what're we going to do, what're we going to do?",1,19
joey,Alright alright. you are a monkey. you are loose in the city. Where do you go?,1,19
chandler,"Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably going to want to do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.",1,19
rachel,"Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's going to be home any minute! He's going to kill me!",1,19
monica,"Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.",1,19
rachel,"Well, what am I going to do? What am I going to do?",1,19
monica,"Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.",1,19
rachel,Anybody want to trade? Oh...,1,19
mr. heckles,What do want?,1,19
monica,"Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?",1,19
mr. heckles,"I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?",1,19
monica,No!,1,19
phoebe,Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?,1,19
mr. heckles,I wasn't ready for it.,1,19
monica,A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?,1,19
mr. heckles,Saw Regis Philbin once...,1,19
phoebe,"Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.",1,19
mr. heckles,You owe me a waffle.,1,19
rachel,"Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face...  ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.",1,19
ross,"Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?",1,19
rachel,"Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?",1,19
ross,"Yeah. You, uh, you want some?",1,19
rachel,"Oh, I would love some. But you know what? You know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kind of crazy. You want to go to Newark?",1,19
ross,"Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kind of wanting to run something by you. You know how we were, uh, you know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?  Well-",1,19
rachel,"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.",1,19
ross,"Okay, quick and painful.",1,19
rachel,"Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.",1,19
ross,"Oh, what? What-what?",1,19
rachel,You know Marcel?,1,19
ross,...Yeah?,1,19
rachel,"Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.",1,19
ross,"I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.",1,19
rachel,"I know, I know, I'm sorry-",1,19
ross,"No, you know what, I guess it's partially my fault. You know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.",1,19
rachel,"Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I-  Oh! Who is it?",1,19
intercom,Animal Control.,1,19
rachel,See? I've even called Animal Control!,1,19
ross,You called Animal Control?,1,19
rachel,Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?,1,19
ross,"Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.",1,19
rachel,"O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...",1,19
ross,"that is right, I. Because I didn't expect you were going to invite them to the apartment!",1,19
rachel,"Hi, thanks for coming.",1,19
luisa,Somebody called about a monkey?,1,19
rachel,"OH, you know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!",1,19
ross,"Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.",1,19
rachel,Turned out it was a hat.,1,19
ross,Cat!,1,19
rachel,Cat! What am I saying? Cat!,1,19
monica,"Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.",1,19
luisa,Marcel?,1,19
ross,My uncle Marcel.,1,19
phoebe,"Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?",1,19
luisa,"Okay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?",1,19
phoebe,Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?,1,19
monica,"Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?",1,19
phoebe,"Yes, but there isn't always time!",1,19
monica,"Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.",1,19
luisa,"Oh my God, you are! And you are Rachel Green!",1,19
rachel,Yeah!,1,19
luisa,Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!,1,19
rachel,Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!,1,19
monica,The Luisa from home room!,1,19
rachel,Yes!!,1,19
luisa,"You have no idea who I am, do you.",1,19
monica,"No, none at all.",1,19
rachel,None.,1,19
luisa,"Well, maybe that is because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?",1,19
monica,"Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!",1,19
luisa,"Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems.  But you? What a bitch!",1,19
rachel,What?!,1,19
monica,"Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? You know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?",1,19
luisa,"I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.",1,19
phoebe,Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.,1,19
chandler,Marcel?,1,19
joey,Marcel?,1,19
chandler,Marcel?,1,19
joey,Marcel?,1,19
woman no. 1,"Hi, can I help you?",1,19
chandler,"Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...",1,19
joey,A monkey.,1,19
chandler,Yes have you seen any?,1,19
woman no. 1,"No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?",1,19
joey,"Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?",1,19
woman no. 1,Of course.,1,19
joey,"Oh. Then, no.",1,19
woman no. 2,Did I put too much rum in here?,1,19
woman no. 1,Just a sec.  Hope you find your monkey.,1,19
chandler,"Oh, no no no wait wait wait no no! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.",1,19
joey,"Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?",1,19
chandler,"Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.",1,19
joey,"We can't, alright?  We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.",1,19
chandler,"Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.",1,19
joey,Marcel?,1,19
chandler,Marcel?!,1,19
phoebe,Marcel?,1,19
monica,Marcel?,1,19
phoebe,Marcel?,1,19
monica and phoebe,Marcel?,1,19
phoebe,Oh-my-God!,1,19
monica,What!,1,19
phoebe,Something just brushed up against my right leg!,1,19
monica,What is it?,1,19
phoebe,"Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.",1,19
monica,"Look, Phoebe!",1,19
phoebe,"Yeah! Oh, come here, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, come here!",1,19
luisa,"Step aside, ladies!",1,19
monica,What are you going to do?,1,19
luisa,Just a small tranquiliser.,1,19
monica,"Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel!  Are you okay?",1,19
phoebe,"Yeah, think so. Oh!  Huh.  Woah.",1,19
monica,Oh gosh.,1,19
ross,Marcel?,1,19
rachel,Marcel?,1,19
ross,"Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.",1,19
rachel,"Ross, you don't know that.",1,19
ross,"Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village.  And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.",1,19
rachel,"Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm going to break my foot, right here.  Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!",1,19
ross,"Yeah, yeah. you know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!",1,19
rachel,"You know, it is not like I did this on purpose.",1,19
ross,"Oh, no no no. No no, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you are off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...",1,19
rachel,Ross.,1,19
ross,"I don't even want to hear it, you are just...",1,19
rachel,Ross.,1,19
ross,"Oh, forget it, okay?",1,19
rachel,Ross!,1,19
ross,What? What?,1,19
monica and phoebe,"Hey! Hey, Bananaman!",1,19
phoebe,"Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.",1,19
ross,"Hi, did you order some bananas?",1,19
mr. heckles,What about it?,1,19
ross,give me back my monkey.,1,19
mr. heckles,I don't have a monkey.,1,19
rachel,Then what's with all the bananas?,1,19
mr. heckles,Potassium.,1,19
ross,"Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?",1,19
ross,Marcel! What've you done to him?,1,19
mr. heckles,"that is my monkey. that is Patti, Patti the monkey.",1,19
ross,"Are you insane? come here, Marcel, c'mon.",1,19
mr. heckles,"come here, Patti.",1,19
ross,"come here, Marcel.",1,19
mr. heckles,"come here, Patti.",1,19
luisa,"Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey!  Gotcha.",1,19
ross,"Okay, give me my monkey back.",1,19
mr. heckles,that is my monkey.,1,19
luisa,you are both going to have to take this up with the judge.,1,19
mr. heckles,"that is not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.",1,19
ross,"Alright, I want my monkey.",1,19
luisa,No!,1,19
rachel,"Oh, c'mon, Luisa!",1,19
luisa,"Sorry, prom queen.",1,19
ross,"You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.",1,19
rachel,"Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!",1,19
luisa,Nope.,1,19
rachel,"Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?",1,19
ross,"It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will.  Or we can leave it on for now, that is fine.",1,19
rachel,"You know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.",1,19
ross,"Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...",1,19
rachel,"Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...",1,19
ross,"Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, you know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?",1,19
rachel,That'd be good.,1,19
ross,"Alright.  The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming.  Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...",1,19
barry,Rachel.,1,19
rachel,Barry?!,1,19
barry,"I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.",1,19
ross and rachel,Oh!,1,19
ross,We have got to start locking that door!,1,19
monica,This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?,1,19
phoebe,Nope.,1,19
monica,that is because I'm in front of them.,1,19
chandler,Eh. I thought that was an alp.,1,19
monica,"Well, high school was not my favourite time.",1,19
joey,"I don't know, I loved high school. You know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.",1,19
chandler,"Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.",1,19
monica,"Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?",1,19
phoebe,Oh. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!  Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Ooh! Ooh!,1,19
chandler,I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.,1,20
joey,"No way! Mr. Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, the toughest snack there is.",1,20
ross,"I don't know, you don't want to mess with corn nuts. They're crazy.",1,20
monica,Oh my God. You guys! You got to come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!,1,20
ross,I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!,1,20
rachel,"Oh, that is so sick.",1,20
chandler,I feel violated. And not in a good way.,1,20
phoebe,"How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!",1,20
chandler,"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...",1,20
monica,So have you called her yet?,1,20
chandler,"Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right, right?",1,20
joey and ross,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.",1,20
monica,I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.,1,20
phoebe,"Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!",1,20
chandler,"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.",1,20
joey,Her answer machine?,1,20
chandler,"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.",1,20
phoebe,"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?",1,20
chandler,"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o.""",1,20
monica,"Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!",1,20
ross,"Okay, okay, what's going on?",1,20
phoebe,"Okay, they're just talking...",1,20
ross,"Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?",1,20
phoebe,"No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!",1,20
ross,What? What? What?!,1,20
phoebe,That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  Oh!,1,20
chandler,"And basically, that is how a bill becomes a law.",1,20
all,Oh!... Right!,1,20
chandler,Hey Rach!,1,20
monica,How'd it go?,1,20
rachel,"You know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where you know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...",1,20
phoebe,Not a good day for birds...,1,20
rachel,"Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...",1,20
ross,"that is nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?",1,20
rachel,"Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, you know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!",1,20
ross,"that is, that is nice twice!",1,20
monica,"Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?",1,20
joey,"Duh, where've you been?",1,20
rachel,"Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, you know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?",1,20
chandler,Yes!,1,20
rachel,Why?,1,20
chandler,I have my reasons.,1,20
monica,"Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?",1,20
rachel,"All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!",1,20
rachel,Wow... Wow!,1,20
barry,Yeah.,1,20
rachel,"I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.",1,20
barry,"No, it wasn't.",1,20
rachel,"Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...",1,20
chandler,"Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!",1,20
monica,that is what you've been working on for the past two hours?!,1,20
chandler,"Hey, I've been honing!",1,20
ross,What was with the dishes?,1,20
chandler,"Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant. You know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",1,20
monica,"Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!",1,20
phoebe,Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!,1,20
monica,"Great, now he's waving back.",1,20
joey,"Man, we got to do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!",1,20
monica,What kind of stuff?,1,20
joey,"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.",1,20
phoebe,You cook naked?,1,20
joey,"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.",1,20
chandler,What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.,1,20
barry,What's the matter?,1,20
rachel,"Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.",1,20
barry,"No, it was. It was very very good.",1,20
rachel,"Well, what about Mindy?",1,20
barry,"Oh, way, way better than Mindy.",1,20
rachel,"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?",1,20
barry,"Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her.",1,20
rachel,"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.",1,20
bernice,"Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.",1,20
barry,"Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.",1,20
rachel,"Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..",1,20
barry,"We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.",1,20
rachel,I had a bra.,1,20
bobby,"Hey, Dr. Farber.",1,20
barry,"All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.",1,20
rachel,What?!,1,20
bobby,"I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.",1,20
chandler,Can I use your phone?,1,20
monica,"Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.",1,20
chandler,"Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?",1,20
joey,Maybe she never got your message.,1,20
phoebe,"You know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.",1,20
chandler,You do not think that makes me seem a little...,1,20
ross,"...desperate, needy, pathetic?",1,20
chandler,"Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.",1,20
phoebe,How many beeps?,1,20
chandler,She answered.,1,20
monica,"You see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.",1,20
chandler,"I'm not going to talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.",1,20
all,Hey! Hi!,1,20
phoebe,How'd he take it?,1,20
rachel,"Pretty well, actually...",1,20
monica,"Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?",1,20
rachel,"Oh, do I?",1,20
monica,Uh huh.,1,20
rachel,We ended up having sex in his chair.,1,20
monica,"You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?",1,20
ross,You-you had what?,1,20
phoebe,Sex in his chair.,1,20
ross,"What, uh... what were you thinking?",1,20
rachel,"I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'It is like you and Carol.",1,20
ross,"No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!",1,20
rachel,"Please. If she said to you, ""Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,"" what would you say?",1,20
chandler,"If it helps, I could slide over.",1,20
ross,"It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally different situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbian- I got to go.",1,20
phoebe,Where are you going?,1,20
ross,"I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?",1,20
chandler,Hello? Hello?,1,20
rachel,"Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you?  Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great.  Really?  Oh.  Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and...  Okay...  Great...  Great...  All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow!  Okay..  Okay...  Bye.  Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.",1,20
chandler,So how's Mindy?,1,20
rachel,"Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I got to call Barry...  Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that is where you'd be!",1,20
monica,Brrrrrrr!,1,20
chandler,Hell is filled with people like you.,1,20
joey,He's back! The peeper's back!,1,20
joey,Get down!,1,20
rachel,Get down?,1,20
chandler,...And boogie!,1,20
rachel,"Thanks, but I got to go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.",1,20
monica,"Relax. You know, she may not even know.",1,20
rachel,"Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..",1,20
joey,Yeah?,1,20
rachel,"And now, you know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..",1,20
joey,..Naughty!,1,20
rachel,"Right, I'll see you guys later...",1,20
joey,"Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kind of little uniform, or-  that is fine, yeah...",1,20
chandler,"Okay, I'm going to go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?",1,20
monica,Why don't you just take it with you?,1,20
chandler,"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?",1,20
monica,Why don't you just call her?,1,20
chandler,"I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.",1,20
monica,Do you?,1,20
chandler,"No!  Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler!  I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone.  Oh, uh, okay, that is fine, that is great.  Okay.   She's on the other line, she's going to call me back.  She's on the other line, she's going to call me back, she's on the other line, going to call me back...",1,20
monica,Don't you have to pee?,1,20
chandler,it is why I'm dancing...,1,20
rachel,Mindy.,1,20
mindy,"Hey, you.",1,20
rachel,"Hey, you.... So, what's up?",1,20
mindy,Um.. we should really be sitting for this.,1,20
rachel,Sure we should... So.,1,20
mindy,"Now, I know things have been weird lately, but you are like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, Because she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just going to ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.",1,20
rachel,Okay.,1,20
mindy,Will you be my maid of honour?,1,20
rachel,Of course!,1,20
mindy,Oh that is so great!,1,20
rachel,Was that all you wanted to ask me?,1,20
mindy,that is all!,1,20
rachel,oh!!  ...What? What?,1,20
mindy,that is not all.,1,20
rachel,Oh sure it is!,1,20
mindy,"Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.",1,20
rachel,"Um, what- what would make you think that?",1,20
mindy,"Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.",1,20
rachel,"Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.",1,20
mindy,"Oh God! You see, that is what I was afraid of!",1,20
rachel,What? What's what you were afraid of?,1,20
mindy,"Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.",1,20
rachel,What?,1,20
mindy,"I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said ""Don't do it, he's just going to do to you what he did to Rachel,"" and now I feel so stupid.",1,20
rachel,"Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.",1,20
mindy,What do you mean?,1,20
rachel,Smell familiar?,1,20
mindy,Oh no.,1,20
rachel,"Oh, I am so sorry.",1,20
mindy,"No me, I am so sorry...",1,20
joey,Oh my.,1,20
ross,Four letters,1,20
chandler,"Ring dammit, ring!",1,20
ross,Thanks.,1,20
joey,"Hey, you know our phone's not working?",1,20
chandler,What?!,1,20
joey,"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.",1,20
chandler,"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!",1,20
monica,Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.,1,20
joey,"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",1,20
chandler,Nngghhh!!!!!!!,1,20
joey,"Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.",1,20
ross,"""Heating device.""",1,20
phoebe,Radiator.,1,20
ross,Five letters.,1,20
phoebe,Rdtor.,1,20
joey,"Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman.",1,20
monica,So she's a woman! So what?,1,20
joey,"Yeah. Yeah, so what?  Look, I live across the street,  and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay?  Yeah, I can see you right now!  Hello!  If I want to walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like——Thank you, but... that is not really the point...  The point is that...  Mostly free weights, but occasionally..",1,20
monica,Joey!!,1,20
joey,"Yeah, my neighbour...  Yeah, the brunette...  She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.",1,20
monica,The green dress? Really?,1,20
joey,"Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.",1,20
monica,No!,1,20
rachel,Hey. Got a second?,1,20
barry,"Sure, sure. Come on...  ...in...",1,20
mindy,"Hello, sweetheart.",1,20
barry,Uh... uh... what are you... what are you guys doing here?,1,20
rachel,"Uh, we are here to break up with you.",1,20
barry,Both of you?,1,20
mindy,"Basically, we think you are a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.",1,20
barry,"I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!",1,20
rachel,"Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?",1,20
barry,"....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.",1,20
rachel,Even when we were having sex in that chair?,1,20
barry,"I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.",1,20
rachel,Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a line-up!,1,20
mindy,You did it twice?,1,20
rachel,"Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, you know, 'it is Barry.",1,20
mindy,Okay...,1,20
barry,"Sweetheart, just give me- give me another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.",1,20
bernice,"Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.",1,20
barry,"Oh God...  I'll be right there, Bernice.  Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.",1,20
rachel,"Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.",1,20
mindy,Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still going to marry him.,1,20
rachel,"What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!",1,20
mindy,"Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really want to be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.",1,20
rachel,Oh God.,1,20
mindy,I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honour...?,1,20
rachel,And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.,1,20
monica,You okay?,1,20
rachel,Yeah.,1,20
monica,Really?,1,20
rachel,"Yeah! you know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.",1,20
monica,Aww...,1,20
joey,Big day.,1,20
joey,"All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...",1,20
phoebe,You know he's gay?,1,20
ross,I just want to clarify this,1,20
danielle,Chandler?,1,20
chandler,"Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.",1,20
all,Hi. Hi.,1,20
chandler,What are you doing here?,1,20
danielle,"Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.",1,20
chandler,"...I'm, I'm okay.",1,20
danielle,"Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?",1,20
chandler,"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",1,20
danielle,You got it.,1,20
chandler,Okay.,1,20
danielle,"good bye, everybody.",1,20
all,Bye.,1,20
phoebe,Whoo-hoo!,1,20
monica,"Yeah, there you go!",1,20
ross,Second date!,1,20
chandler,...I don't know.,1,20
rachel,You don't know?!,1,20
chandler,"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?",1,20
joey,How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?,1,21
monica,I have no idea. But look how much they spent!,1,21
rachel,"Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.",1,21
monica,I know. It's just such reckless spending.,1,21
ross,"I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.",1,21
chandler,"Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.",1,21
monica,that is me.,1,21
phoebe,"Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!",1,21
ross,"Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-  come here, Marcel-",1,21
rachel,"Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.",1,21
monica,"Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.",1,21
ross,"What? It's, it's just a phase.",1,21
chandler,"Well, that is what we said about Joey...",1,21
ross,Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.,1,21
rachel,Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!,1,21
ross,What?,1,21
rachel,Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.,1,21
rachel,"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.",1,21
monica,This woman's living my life.,1,21
rachel,What?,1,21
monica,"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I want to see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.",1,21
rachel,you are not an artist.,1,21
monica,"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.",1,21
rachel,"Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.",1,21
monica,"Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.",1,21
rachel,"Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...",1,21
monica,Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?,1,21
rachel,No...,1,21
monica,"This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.",1,21
chandler,How about Joey... Pepponi?,1,21
joey,"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that is more neutral.",1,21
chandler,Joey... Switzerland?,1,21
joey,"Plus, you know, I think it should be Joe. you know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I don't know, this big.  Which I'm not.",1,21
chandler,Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?,1,21
joey,Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,1,21
chandler,"Well, it does not ring a bell with me...",1,21
joey,"Joe Stalin. You know, that is pretty good.",1,21
chandler,Might want to try Joseph.,1,21
joey,Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!,1,21
chandler,"Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.",1,21
rachel,Hey.,1,21
phoebe,Hey.,1,21
monica,"Hi.  Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.",1,21
phoebe,What are you doing?,1,21
monica,"Alright, great. Thanks a lot.  I'm going to tap class.",1,21
rachel,"What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?",1,21
monica,"This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.",1,21
rachel,"Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, you know what, honey, you are kind of losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.",1,21
phoebe,"This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.",1,21
monica,What d'you think?,1,21
phoebe,Lots of things.,1,21
rachel,Which one do you think she is?,1,21
teacher,May I help you?,1,21
monica,"Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.",1,21
teacher,You don't observe a dance class. You dance,1,21
rachel,What does she mean?,1,21
phoebe,I think she means  'You dance,1,21
monica,"Okay, did you see anybody you think could be me?",1,21
teacher,People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!,1,21
rachel,She could be you.,1,21
teacher,"Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...",1,21
monica,"Okay, I'm not getting this!",1,21
phoebe,I'm totally getting it!,1,21
monica,Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?,1,21
rachel,What? You just click when they click.,1,21
teacher,"Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.",1,21
phoebe,"Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.",1,21
monica,Great. It's gym class all over again.,1,21
phoebe and rachel,Aww.,1,21
teacher,"Well that is all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.",1,21
monica,Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.,1,21
woman,"It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?",1,21
teacher,She's your partner.,1,21
woman,Hi. I'm Monica.,1,21
monica,Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.,1,21
woman,Monana?,1,21
monica,Yeah. It's Dutch.,1,21
monana,you are kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.,1,21
monica,"Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.",1,21
teacher,"And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...",1,21
ross,Hi.,1,21
chandler and joey,Hey.,1,21
joey,Where've you been?,1,21
ross,At the vet.,1,21
chandler,"She's not going to make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?",1,21
ross,She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.,1,21
joey,Hey! He beat you.,1,21
ross,"She says as time goes on, he's going to start getting aggressive and violent.",1,21
chandler,So what does this mean?,1,21
ross,I'm going to have to give him up.,1,21
joey,"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!",1,21
chandler,"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?",1,21
ross,"I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.",1,21
joey,Isn't there any way you can keep him?,1,21
ross,"No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey loving,' he's just going to get vicious. I've just got to get him into a zoo.",1,21
joey,How do you get a monkey into a zoo?,1,21
chandler,"I know that one! ...No, that is Popes into a Volkswagen.",1,21
ross,"Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, you know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, you know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that is a possibility.",1,21
chandler,"Yeah, but that is like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.",1,21
phoebe,"Hey. We found her, we found the girl.",1,21
chandler,What?,1,21
joey,Did you call the cops?,1,21
rachel,Nope. We took her to lunch.,1,21
chandler,Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.,1,21
ross,What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.,1,21
monica,"You know what? After you are with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.",1,21
ross,"Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.",1,21
chandler,...Take off their hats!,1,21
phoebe,Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.,1,21
rachel,No way. No way did you do this.,1,21
monana,Monana was very brave.,1,21
monica,It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!,1,21
monana,"So once they caught on to the fact that we are you know, short and have breasts...",1,21
monica,...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!,1,21
rachel,"Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.",1,21
monana,"Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.",1,21
monica,excuse me?,1,21
monana,"There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. what do you say?",1,21
monica,"No no no no no no. Think who you are dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.",1,21
monana,"Well, that is just probably Because of your Amish background.",1,21
monica,What?,1,21
monana,"Well, you are Pennsylvania Dutch, right?",1,21
monica,"Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.",1,21
monana,I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?,1,21
monica,Uh-huh.,1,21
monana,"I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that is two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.",1,21
monica,Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.,1,21
ross,"Oh God.  We didn't get into Scranton.  That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.",1,21
phoebe,I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.,1,21
ross,"Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?",1,21
rachel,"Oh, somebody will.",1,21
joey,You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?,1,21
chandler,you are kidding.,1,21
joey,Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!,1,21
chandler,"You know, you'd think I would've.",1,21
joey,Phoebe. What do you think a good stage name for me would be?,1,21
phoebe,...Flame Boy.,1,21
ross,Where exactly is your zoo?,1,21
dr. baldhara,"Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?",1,21
ross,Yes.,1,21
dr. baldhara,"Does he, uh, fight with other animals?",1,21
ross,"No-no, he's, he's very docile.",1,21
dr. baldhara,Even if he were... cornered?,1,21
ross,"Well I, I don't know. Why?",1,21

dr. franzblau,"No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.",1,23
rachel,"Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.",1,23
dr. franzblau,"No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.",1,23
rachel,Oh.,1,23
dr. franzblau,"I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?",1,23
rachel,I'm a waitress.,1,23
dr. franzblau,"Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you are just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...",1,23

lydia,"Yeah, they're not so bad.",1,23
ross,"Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.  This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, you know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.",1,23
susan,The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.,1,23
ross,"No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?",1,23
susan,"You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.",1,23
ross,Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.,1,23
phoebe,This is so great.,1,23
ross,You want to explain that?,1,23
phoebe,"I mean, well, Because when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.  I'm sorry, you were fighting.",1,23
carol,Where are they?,1,23

dr. franzblau,"All right, ten centimetres, here we go.",1,23
nurse,"All right, honey, time to start pushing.",1,23
carol,But they're not here yet!,1,23
dr. franzblau,"I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.",1,23
carol,"Oh, god.",1,23

carol,Where have you been?,1,23
ross,"Long story, honey.",1,23
dr. franzblau,"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need— Excuse me, could I have this?",1,23
nurse,"All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!",1,23
all,Good luck!,1,23
chandler,"Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?",1,23
nurse,Out!,1,23
dr. franzblau,"All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.",1,23
ross,"Let me see, I got to see, I got to see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?",1,23
carol,Not.... helping!,1,23
dr. franzblau,"you are doing great, you are doing fine.",1,23
ross,"Hello!  Oh, sorry.",1,23
susan,What do you see? What do you see?,1,23
ross,"We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.",1,23
susan,"Oh, look at that.",1,23
carol,What does he look like?,1,23
ross,"kind of like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.",1,23
carol,Really?,1,23
phoebe,"You guys, he's beautiful!",1,23
ross,"Oh, thanks, Pheebs!",1,23
susan,"No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.",1,23
ross,How 'bout Ben?,1,23
susan,I like Ben.,1,23
carol,Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?,1,23
ross,"We uh, we just cooked it up.",1,23

chandler,"I know, I still am one of these.",1,23
monica,"Ross, can I?",1,23
ross,"The head, the head. You got to...",1,23
monica,"Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.",1,23
ross,"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.  But I'll still always come back, like this.  And sometimes I may be away longer, like this.  But I'll still always come back, like this.",1,23
chandler,"And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.",1,23
monica,He is so amazing.,1,23
rachel,"Oh, I know. Look at him.",1,23
joey,"Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that is his name.",1,23

monica,"OK, how does everybody like their burgers?",1,24
rachel,"Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.",1,24
monica,"Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?",1,24
joey,"Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're going to... complete the transaction, if you know what I...",1,24
joey,"Then you do. Heh, heh.",1,24
monica,"So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?",1,24
joey,What do you mean?,1,24
monica,"You know, just be there for her.",1,24
joey,Not following you.,1,24
monica,Think about it.,1,24
rachel,"OK, I'm guessing this is from...",1,24
rachel,"Well, thank you, Melanie.",1,24
chandler,"OK, this one right here is from me.",1,24
rachel,"OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's...  Travel Scrabble! Ooooh, thank you!",1,24
rachel,This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And......it's a book!,1,24
phoebe,"Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!",1,24
joey,,1,24
melanie,There is a little child inside this man!,1,24
chandler,"Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.",1,24
rachel,Who's this from?,1,24
chandler,"Oh, that is Ross's.",1,24
rachel,Oh... ...  Oh my God. He remembered.,1,24
phoebe,Remembered what?,1,24
rachel,"It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!",1,24
chandler,"Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?",1,24
phoebe,"Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.",1,24
monica,I can't believe he did this.,1,24
chandler,"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?",1,24
rachel,What did you just say?,1,24
chandler,ahem... um... Crystal duck.,1,24
rachel,"No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?",1,24
chandler,F-hah.... flennin....,1,24
rachel,Oh.... my God.,1,24
chandler,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no....",1,24
joey,"that is good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.",1,24
rachel,"I mean, this is unbelievable.",1,24
phoebe,"I know. This is really, really huge.",1,24
chandler,No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.,1,24
phoebe,Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever going to be the same ever again.,1,24
chandler,"OK, is there a mute button on this woman?",1,24
monica,"I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?",1,24
rachel,"No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just...",1,24
joey,"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.",1,24
rachel,"Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.",1,24
chandler,H-He's in China!,1,24
joey,The country.,1,24
monica,"No, no, wait.  His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.",1,24
chandler,What about the time difference?,1,24
monica,From here to the airport?,1,24
chandler,Yes!  you are never going to make it!,1,24
monica,"Rachel, what're you going to say to him?",1,24
rachel,I-I-I don't know.,1,24
chandler,Well then maybe you shouldn't go.,1,24
joey,"He's right, cause if you are just going to, like, break his heart, that is the kind of thing that can wait.",1,24
monica,"Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.",1,24
rachel,I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.,1,24
phoebe,"Here, look, alright, does this help?",1,24
rachel,"No... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. You know, I just, I've just got to talk to him. I... I got to... OK, I'll see you later.",1,24
chandler,"Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!",1,24
ross,,1,24
flight attendant,Alright!,1,24
ross,Ni-chou chi-ma!,1,24
rachel,"Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....",1,24
flight attendant,Hi!,1,24
rachel,Hi.,1,24
flight attendant,May I see your boarding pass?,1,24
rachel,"Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.",1,24
flight attendant,"Oh, ooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.",1,24
rachel,"No, I know, but I—he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...",1,24
flight attendant,No no no! Federal regulations!,1,24
rachel,"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.",1,24
flight attendant,Alright. What's the message?,1,24
rachel,Uh... I don't know.,1,24
flight attendant,"Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.",1,24
man,What?,1,24
flight attendant,"It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.",1,24
man,,1,24
melanie,"Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!",1,24
joey,"Heh, heh. It was nothing'.",1,24
melanie,"Well, now we've got to find something fun for you!",1,24
joey,"Uhhh..you know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.",1,24
melanie,M-Me again?,1,24
joey,Sure! Why not?,1,24
melanie,"Boy, somebody's going to get a big fruit basket tomorrow.",1,24
melanie,"Ooh, I got to tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.",1,24
joey,How do you mean?,1,24
melanie,"I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you are a giver. you are like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you are practically a woman.",1,24
monica,"Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you want to save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you going to go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?",1,24
rachel,"I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, you know, it's Ross. You know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.",1,24
monica and phoebe,Sure.,1,24
rachel,"I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.",1,24
monica,"Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! You know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!",1,24
phoebe,"Yeah, but, you know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.",1,24
monica,Another good point.,1,24
phoebe,"No, I mean, I mean, when you are at the fifteenth date, you know, you are already in a very relationshippy place. You know, it's... you are committed.",1,24
rachel,Huh?,1,24
phoebe,"Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?",1,24
monica,Why isn't it working out?,1,24
rachel,I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.,1,24
monica,Is he not cute enough for you?,1,24
rachel,No!,1,24
monica,Does he not make enough money?,1,24
rachel,"No, I'm just....",1,24
phoebe,Maybe there's someone else.,1,24
rachel,What...,1,24
monica,Is there? Is there someone else?,1,24
rachel,No! There is.. there is no one else!,1,24
monica,Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?,1,24
chandler,"Hey, big...",1,24
joey,Shhhh!,1,24
chandler,...spender.,1,24
joey,She's still asleep.,1,24
chandler,So how'd it go?,1,24
joey,"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you are great in bed?",1,24
chandler,The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.,1,24
joey,"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!",1,24
chandler,"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.",1,24
joey,"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, you know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.",1,24
chandler,I didn't know you had another level.,1,24
joey,I know! Neither did I!,1,24
monica,"Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?",1,24
rachel,Yeah.,1,24
monica,"Oh, from who?",1,24
rachel,From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.,1,24
monica,"Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?",1,24
rachel,"Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, you know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.",1,24
monica,"Oh, why?",1,24
rachel,"Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't want to...",1,24
monica,"No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!",1,24
rachel,"Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you are already so...",1,24
monica,"I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.",1,24
rachel,Who is it?,1,24
intercom,"It's me, Carl.",1,24
rachel,C'mon up.,1,24
monica,Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.,1,24
joey,Seven hundred bucks!,1,24
chandler,"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?",1,24
joey,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? you know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.",1,24
chandler,"Really? So, you are going to stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?",1,24
joey,"What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?",1,24
carl,"I'm just saying', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm going to shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!",1,24
ross,I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.,1,24
rachel,"Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.",1,24
ross,"Fine, just stop thinking about me.",1,24
ross,"Can't do it, can you?",1,24
rachel,So I'm thinking about you. So what?,1,24
ross,"I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?",1,24
rachel,Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....,1,24
carl,"I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!",1,24
ross,"Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.",1,24
rachel,"Ross, it's too hard.",1,24
ross,"No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.",1,24
rachel,"Ross, you are like my best friend.",1,24
ross,I know.,1,24
rachel,"If we broke up, and I lost you...",1,24
ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're going to break up?",1,24
rachel,"Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?",1,24
ross,"No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?",1,24
rachel,"I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.",1,24
ross,"Well, start looking.",1,24
rachel,Wow.,1,24
carl,Exactly! And you just know I'm going to be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!,1,24
rachel,Right! you are right!,1,24
carl,Heh...you know?,1,24
rachel,You know what?,1,24
carl,What?,1,24
rachel,"I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do....  I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I got to go. I'm sorry.",1,24
carl,But...,1,24
rachel,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.",1,24
man,"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!",1,24
ross,"Oh, hey, hey, I got that.",1,24
julie,"Oh, thanks, sweetie.",1,24
ross,No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.,1,24
julie,Really?,1,24
ross,Yeah.,1,24
julie,You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?,1,24
ross,"No, no, they will. I just... uh...",1,24
ross and julie,Can't wait.,1,24
ross,"Come on, they're going to love you.",1,24
phoebe,"Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that is pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?",2,1
rachel,Oh my god. Oh my god.  Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!,2,1
ross,Rach!,2,1
rachel,"Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?",2,1
ross,"It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?",2,1
rachel,What?,2,1
ross,you are bleeding.,2,1
rachel,"I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I want to hear everything! Everything.",2,1
ross,"Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.",2,1
rachel,"These are, these aren't for you.  These are for you.  Welcome to our country.",2,1
julie,Thank you. I'm from New York.,2,1
rachel,"Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.",2,1
chandler,No way!,2,1
monica,"I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's going to go for it with Ross!",2,1
phoebe,"Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?",2,1
joey,"Um, this?",2,1
phoebe,Yes.,2,1
monica,"Guys, you got your hair cut.",2,1
chandler,"Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.",2,1
phoebe,"Because, you know,  if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.",2,1
rachel,"Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.",2,1
chandler,"Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.",2,1
rachel,"You, you, you said he liked me.  You, you slowpokes!",2,1
ross,"that is all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?",2,1
joey,What up?!,2,1
ross,"Everyone, this is Julie.",2,1
rachel,Julie.,2,1
all,OH.  Hi!,2,1
julie,"Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.",2,1
ross,And bus.,2,1
julie,Oh my god.,2,1
ross,The screaming guy?,2,1
julie,And the spitting?,2,1
ross,You got to hear this story.,2,1
julie,"We're on this bus, that is easily 200 years old...",2,1
ross,200 at least.,2,1
julie,...and this guy...,2,1
rachel,"And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.",2,1
monica,"This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?",2,1
julie,"Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.",2,1
ross,"But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.",2,1
rachel,"Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?",2,1
monica,It's an expression.,2,1
ross,"Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're going to go see the baby.",2,1
julie,And then we've got to get some sleep.,2,1
ross,"Yeah, it's really 6",2,1
chandler,"Well, listen, don't tell us what's going to happen though, Because I like to be surprised.",2,1
rachel,Bye.,2,1
ross,"Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?",2,1
rachel,"Yeah, sure.",2,1
ross,Thank you.,2,1
chandler,"Hey, Rach, can I get...",2,1
rachel,Did you talk to him?,2,1
chandler,Not yet.,2,1
rachel,"Then, no.",2,1
chandler,"So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.",2,1
ross,"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never going to happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?",2,1
chandler,God?,2,1
ross,"It was you, pal.",2,1
chandler,"Well, maybe it was God, doing me.",2,1
ross,"Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that is all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're having' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.",2,1
chandler,"Well, you owe me one, big guy.",2,1
rachel,Here's your lemonade.,2,1
ross,I didn't order lemonade.,2,1
rachel,"Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're going to charge you for that.",2,1
ross,But...,2,1
rachel,"Go-go-go-go, come on!   So uh, what did you find out?",2,1
chandler,"He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you want to see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.",2,1
rachel,How is that the silver lining?,2,1
chandler,You have to really want to see it.,2,1
ross,"Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.",2,1
monica,"Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?",2,1
phoebe,"Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you are wondering if they've changed it?",2,1
monica,"No, although now that is what I'm thinking.",2,1
phoebe,"All right, so what were you thinking?",2,1
monica,"Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?",2,1
phoebe,OH! No.,2,1
monica,Why not?,2,1
phoebe,"Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.",2,1
monica,No you are not.,2,1
phoebe,"I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.",2,1
joey,"Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.",2,1
ross,Hello? Hi.,2,1
chandler,Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?,2,1
joey,Needs some clothes altered?,2,1
chandler,"No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.",2,1
joey,"Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been going' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'excuse me, 15.  All right, when was 1990?",2,1
chandler,Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!,2,1
ross,"Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What?  Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three.  Well you didn't hang up either.",2,1
rachel,She didn't hang up either!,2,1
ross,"Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...",2,1
rachel,"Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.",2,1
ross,Rachel! I'll just call her back.,2,1
rachel,Okay!,2,1
ross,"Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected...",2,1
rachel,"Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.",2,1
monica,"Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.",2,1
rachel,"I know you did. I'm just going to deal with it, I'm just going to deal with it.  I got to get out of here.",2,1
chandler,"Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.",2,1
joey,"You know, I think I was sixteen.",2,1
monica,"Please, just a little bit off the back.",2,1
phoebe,"I'm still on ""no.""",2,1
rachel,"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",2,1
joey,"No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not falling' for that again.",2,1
phoebe,What's going' on?,2,1
rachel,"Well, I sort of did a stupid thing last night.",2,1
chandler,What stupid thing did you do?,2,1
paulo,Bon giorno tutti!,2,1
phoebe,Ewww!,2,1
rachel,"Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.",2,1
monica,"Rachel, how did this happen?",2,1
rachel,"I don't know, I just kind of ran into him last night.",2,1
phoebe,Where?,2,1
rachel,At his apartment. Is this juice?,2,1
joey,"Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?",2,1
rachel,"Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.",2,1
monica,"Honey, you are not pathetic, you are sad.",2,1
chandler,People do stupid things when they're upset.,2,1
monica,"My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.",2,1
all,Hi!,2,1
ross,"Hi. Sorry we're late but we were—well, there was touching.",2,1
paulo,"Hey, hey Ross.",2,1
ross,"Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?",2,1
paulo,I do Raquel.,2,1
ross,"So, uh, he's back.",2,1
rachel,"Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?",2,1
ross,"No, not a problem.",2,1
rachel,Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.,2,1
phoebe,"Ok, you are going to have to not touch my ass.",2,1
chandler,"Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.",2,1
joey,"Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.",2,1
chandler,Are you sure he's going to be able to crack that code?,2,1
monica,"You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.",2,1
phoebe,"All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.",2,1
monica,I promise.,2,1
phoebe,"All right.  Now some of you are going to get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are going to feel a thing.",2,1
phoebe,"All right, that is it, I quit.",2,1
monica,What? I didn't say anything.,2,1
phoebe,"Yeah, but this  isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.",2,1
monica,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.",2,1
phoebe,Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.,2,1
monica,How who wears it?,2,1
phoebe,Demi Moore.,2,1
monica,Demi Moore is not a he.,2,1
phoebe,"Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.",2,1
monica,that is Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.,2,1
phoebe,Oh. Oh!,2,1
monica,Oh my God!,2,1
phoebe,Oh my God!,2,1
monica,Oh my God!,2,1
phoebe,"Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?",2,1
monica,"She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!",2,1
phoebe,"Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.",2,1
monica,I know!,2,1
frankie,How long do you want the cuffs?,2,1
chandler,At least as long as I have the pants.,2,1
frankie,"I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.",2,1
rachel,How is she?,2,1
phoebe,"It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.",2,1
ross,How's the hair?,2,1
phoebe,"I'm not going to lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.",2,1
joey,Can we see her?,2,1
phoebe,"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.",2,1
ross,Yeah.,2,1
joey,How're you doing?,2,1
rachel,I'm okay.,2,1
joey,"Ooh, that bad, huh?",2,1
rachel,What?,2,1
joey,"Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.",2,1
rachel,"When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.",2,1
joey,You got to tell Ross how you feel.,2,1
rachel,Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?,2,1
joey,What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.,2,1
rachel,"I don't know, I don't know.",2,1
joey,"Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.",2,1
chandler,"Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec?  Your tailor is a very bad man!",2,1
joey,Frankie? What're you talking about?,2,1
ross,"Hey, what's going' on?",2,1
chandler,Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.,2,1
ross,What?,2,1
joey,No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.,2,1
chandler,"Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...",2,1
ross,What?,2,1
chandler,Cupping.,2,1
joey,"that is how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.  What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?",2,1
ross,"Yes, yes it is. In prison! What is the matter with you?",2,1
joey,What? that is not?  Oh my God.,2,1
monica,Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.,2,1
ross,"I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.",2,1
monica,Thank you. My hair is very amused.,2,1
chandler,"Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.",2,1
phoebe,Thank you.,2,1
ross,"Well, I got to go. Bye. Bye, Rach.",2,1
rachel,"Wait, are you leaving?",2,1
ross,"Yeah, that is kind of what I meant by ""bye!""",2,1
rachel,"Well, can I talk to you for a sec?",2,1
ross,Okay.,2,1
joey,"Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...",2,1
chandler,that is ok.,2,1
ross,What's going' on?,2,1
rachel,"Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?",2,1
ross,"Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?",2,1
rachel,No. No-no-no-no.,2,1
ross,"Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.",2,1
rachel,Really?,2,1
ross,"You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking ""Oh my god, I'm with Rachel"". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie.  Was there a second of all?",2,1
rachel,"No, I think that was the whole all.",2,1
ross,Okay. Okay.  Okay.,2,1
joey,"I swear to god, Dad. that is not how they measure pants.",2,1
julie,"I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?",2,1
phoebe,"Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.",2,1
julie,Really?,2,1
phoebe,You want to do it right now?,2,1
julie,Great!,2,1
phoebe,"Ok, I just want to be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?",2,1
rachel,No. No no no no no. that is Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.,2,1
phoebe,"Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.",2,1
rachel,you are welcome.,2,1
monica,"Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's going to grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.",2,2
phoebe,"Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it.  Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?",2,2
susan,"Oh, is he hungry already?",2,2
carol,I guess so.,2,2
chandler,"You know, it's...  something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.",2,2
joey,"I got to get one, too.",2,2
ross,What are you guys doing?,2,2
chandler,We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?,2,2
ross,"Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.",2,2
joey,"Yeah, we know, but there's a baby sucking' on it.",2,2
ross,"This is my son having lunch, ok? It's going to happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you are uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.",2,2
ross,Carol?,2,2
chandler,Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?,2,2
carol,Sure.,2,2
joey,"Uh, does it hurt?",2,2
carol,"It did at first, but not anymore.",2,2
joey,Chandler?,2,2
chandler,"So, uh, how often can you do it?",2,2
carol,As much as he needs.,2,2
joey,"Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?",2,2
julie,"Rachel, do you have any muffins left?",2,2
rachel,"Yeah, I forget which ones.",2,2
julie,"Oh, you are busy, that is ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?",2,2
all,No thanks.,2,2
julie,"Oh, you are losing' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.",2,2
rachel,Thank you.  What a bitch.,2,2
julie,"Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?",2,2
phoebe,"I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.",2,2
monica,"Ok, um, I'll go with you.",2,2
julie,Great.,2,2
ross,"Hi, honey.",2,2
chandler,"Hey, sweetums.",2,2
ross,Hello to the rest.,2,2
all,Hi!,2,2
joey,Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?,2,2
monica,"It's going to be a problem, isn't it?",2,2
chandler,"Come on, you are going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? that is like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.",2,2
monica,But I'm...,2,2
phoebe,"Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.",2,2
ross,"So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?",2,2
monica,"Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.",2,2
ross,"It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.",2,2
monica,you are welcome.,2,2
phoebe,"Woof, woof.",2,2
joey,Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?  Hey Annabelle.,2,2
annabelle,"Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?",2,2
joey,Who?,2,2
annabelle,Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.,2,2
hombre man,Hombre?,2,2
joey,What's he doin' in my section?,2,2
annabelle,I guess he doesn't know.,2,2
joey,"Well, he's going to. I'll see you a little later, ok?  Hey, how you doin'?",2,2
hombre man,Morning'.,2,2
joey,"Listen, I know you are new, but it's kind of understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.",2,2
hombre man,"Your territory, huh?",2,2
joey,Yeah. Bijan for men?,2,2
guy,No thanks.,2,2
hombre man,Hombre?,2,2
guy,Yeah. All right.,2,2
hombre man,You were saying?,2,2
monica,"Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.",2,2
phoebe,What?,2,2
monica,"We were shopping, and we had lunch.",2,2
phoebe,"Oh, all right. What did I have?",2,2
monica,You had a salad.,2,2
phoebe,"Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.",2,2
rachel,"Hey, guys, what's up.",2,2
phoebe,"I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.",2,2
rachel,"Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?",2,2
phoebe,"Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.",2,2
rachel,You went shopping for fur?,2,2
phoebe,"Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some,  uh, boobs.",2,2
rachel,You bought boobs?,2,2
phoebe,Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.,2,2
joey,"Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?  Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.",2,2
annabelle,"Oh, actually I sort of have plans.",2,2
hombre man,"Ready, Annabelle?",2,2
annabelle,You bet.  Maybe some other time?,2,2
joey,"Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!",2,2
carol,"Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.",2,2
ross,"Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.",2,2
susan,"Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.",2,2
rachel,"Oh, this is so cute.",2,2
susan,"Oh, I got that for him.",2,2
ross,My mommies love me. that is clever.,2,2
monica,"Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju——Hi, Jew!   Uh huh?  Uh huh?  Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great. See you then. Bye.",2,2
rachel,"Did you just say Hi, Jew?",2,2
monica,"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.",2,2
phoebe,"Ben, dinner!",2,2
ross,"Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you are not supposed to do that.",2,2
phoebe,"Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.",2,2
chandler,What did you just do?,2,2
phoebe,"I licked my arm, what?",2,2
ross,It's breast milk.,2,2
phoebe,So?,2,2
rachel,"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.",2,2
joey,What is the big deal?,2,2
chandler,What did you just do?,2,2
ross,"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?",2,2
phoebe,You won't even taste it?,2,2
ross,No!,2,2
phoebe,Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?,2,2
ross,Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.,2,2
monica,"Hey, where is everybody?",2,2
rachel,They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?,2,2
monica,"Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.",2,2
rachel,"Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way.  Here are your keys, hon.",2,2
monica,Okay.,2,2
rachel,"Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?",2,2
monica,You know what probably happened? Someone must have stolen my credit card.,2,2
rachel,And sort of just put the receipt back in your pocket?,2,2
monica,That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.,2,2
rachel,"Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?",2,2
monica,Judy.,2,2
rachel,Who?,2,2
monica,Julie.,2,2
rachel,What?!,2,2
monica,Jody!,2,2
rachel,You were with Julie?,2,2
monica,"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.",2,2
rachel,Oh. Oh my God.,2,2
monica,"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.",2,2
rachel,"Yeah, right.  Sure!",2,2
monica,"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!",2,2
rachel,"Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.",2,2
monica,That is not true!,2,2
rachel,"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?",2,2
monica,Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?,2,2
rachel,"Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?  Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.",2,2
monica,"Hi, who's this?  Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica.  Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.  Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok?  No, I don't care what Steve thinks.  Hi, Steve.",2,2
carol and susan,Hey!,2,2
carol,How did we do?,2,2
phoebe,"Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.",2,2
ross,I did not freak out.,2,2
carol,Why'd you freak out?,2,2
ross,Because it's breast milk. It's gross.,2,2
carol,My breast milk is gross?,2,2
susan,This should be fun.,2,2
ross,"No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.",2,2
chandler,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.,2,2
carol,"Ross, you are being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.",2,2
ross,That would be no.,2,2
phoebe,Come on. It doesn't taste bad.,2,2
joey,"Yeah, it's kind of sweet, sort of like, uh...",2,2
susan,Cantaloupe juice.,2,2
joey,Exactly.,2,2
ross,You've tasted it? You've tasted it.,2,2
susan,Uh huh.,2,2
ross,"Oh, you've tasted it.",2,2
susan,"You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.",2,2
ross,give me the bottle.  give me the towel.,2,2
chandler,Howdy.,2,2
joey,"give me a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.",2,2
chandler,"Well, maybe it's because of the way you are dressed.",2,2
joey,"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.",2,2
chandler,What do you care? you are an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.,2,2
joey,"I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best.  I don't know. Maybe I should just get out of the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.",2,2
chandler,"All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's going to come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you going to run?",2,2
joey,Yeah I guess you are right.,2,2
chandler,you are damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you are made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.,2,2
joey,I'm going to do it.,2,2
chandler,All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.,2,2
monica,I don't know what else to say.,2,2
rachel,"Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.",2,2
monica,"I feel terrible, I really do.",2,2
rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?",2,2
monica,"Rachel,  say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?",2,2
rachel,Yes.,2,2
monica,It's that terrible?,2,2
rachel,"Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.",2,2
monica,"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,  you are my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.",2,2
rachel,I love you too.,2,2
phoebe,"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too.  Oh, I really needed that.",2,2
monica,"Look, I know that you are in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?",2,2
rachel,"I'd do anything for you, you know that.",2,2
monica,I'd do anything for you.,2,2
phoebe,"Wait, wait, wait, wait!",2,2
joey,"Morning'.  I said, morning'.",2,2
hombre man,I heard you.,2,2
store guy,"All right, everybody, I'm opening' the doors. You boys ready?",2,2
hombre man,Ready.,2,2
joey,"Yeah, I'm ready.",2,2
customer,"You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!",2,2
store guy,"Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?",2,2
hombre man,"I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.",2,2
annabelle,"My god, what happened?",2,2
joey,"These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lasting'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?",2,2
annabelle,Sure.,2,2
julie,So,2,2
rachel,"So I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?",2,2
julie,"I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.",2,2
rachel,Really? Me?,2,2
julie,"Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kind of got the feeling that maybe you don't.",2,2
rachel,"Well, you are not totally paranoid.",2,2
julie,Oy.,2,2
rachel,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not going to bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",2,2
julie,"Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?",2,2
rachel,"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.",2,2
julie,"I'd love it too. Shoot, I got to go. So, I'll talk to you later.",2,2
rachel,"All right, Julie.",2,2
julie,Bye.,2,2
rachel,Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.,2,2
ross,that is not bad.,2,2
chandler,Hey.,2,3
monica,So how was Joan?,2,3
chandler,I broke up with her.,2,3
chandler,"They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.",2,3
rachel,"Come on, they were not that huge.",2,3
chandler,"I'm telling' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.",2,3
monica,How many perfectly fine women are you going to reject over the most superficial insignificant things?,2,3
joey,"Hold it hold it. I got to side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.",2,3
chandler,You or me?,2,3
ross,"I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.",2,3
joey,"You guys are messing' with me, right?",2,3
all,Yeah.,2,3
joey,"That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, ""whoa.""",2,3
phoebe,You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.,2,3
chandler,Maureen Rosilla.,2,3
ross,Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.,2,3
monica,"Hello, Mr. Heckles.",2,3
mr. heckles,you are doing it again.,2,3
monica,We're not doing anything.,2,3
mr. heckles,you are stomping. It's disturbing my birds.,2,3
rachel,You don't have birds.,2,3
mr. heckles,I could have birds.,2,3
monica,"Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.",2,3
mr. heckles,Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.,2,3
rachel,"All right, bye-bye.",2,3
chandler,"Ok, Janice. Janice. You got to give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.",2,3
ross,We'll give you Janice.,2,3
phoebe,"I miss Janice though. ""Hello, Chandler Bing.""",2,3
rachel,"""Oh, my, god.""",2,3
joey,"""Oh, Chandler, now, now, that is it. There, faster!""",2,3
monica,"Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.",2,3
rachel,We won. We won!,2,3
monica,Mr. Heckles.,2,3
rachel,How did this happen?,2,3
mr. treeger,He must have been sweeping'. They found a broom in his hand.,2,3
monica,that is terrible.,2,3
mr. treeger,I know. I was sweeping' yesterday. It could have been me.,2,3
mr. treeger,You never know.,2,3
phoebe,"Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!",2,3
chandler,"Ok, Phoebe.",2,3
phoebe,"I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. that is fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.",2,3
joey,Such as?,2,3
phoebe,"Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?",2,3
ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?",2,3
phoebe,Nah. Not really.,2,3
ross,You don't believe in evolution?,2,3
phoebe,"I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.",2,3
ross,"Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?",2,3
phoebe,"Yeah, I just don't buy it.",2,3
ross,"Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.",2,3
phoebe,"Ok, don't get me started on gravity.",2,3
ross,"You uh, you don't believe in gravity?",2,3
phoebe,"Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.",2,3
chandler,"Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.",2,3
mr. treeger,"There she is. And over there, that is the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.",2,3
monica,What can we do for you?,2,3
mr. boyle,"All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to ""the noisy girls in the apartment above mine"".",2,3
monica,"Well, what about his family?",2,3
mr. boyle,He didn't have any.,2,3
rachel,"Ok, so let's talk money.",2,3
mr. boyle,"All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.",2,3
monica,"I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!",2,3
rachel,Have you ever seen so much crap?,2,3
chandler,"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap",2,3
joey,Check this out. Can I have this?,2,3
ross,How can you not believe in evolution?,2,3
phoebe,Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!,2,3
ross,"Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.",2,3
phoebe,Really? You can actually see it?,2,3
ross,"You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.",2,3
phoebe,"See, I didn't know that.",2,3
ross,"Well, there you go.",2,3
phoebe,"Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?",2,3
chandler,"Hey, look at this. ""My Big Book of Grievances.""",2,3
joey,"Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you are in here too.",2,3
chandler,"April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that is excellent.",2,3
rachel,"Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.",2,3
monica,"Rach, I think we have enough regular lamps.",2,3
rachel,"What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.",2,3
monica,It doesn't go with any of my stuff.,2,3
rachel,"Well, what about my stuff?",2,3
monica,You don't have any stuff.,2,3
rachel,"You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?",2,3
monica,No.,2,3
rachel,"Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.",2,3
monica,Mmm.,2,3
rachel,"Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm going to go find a place for my new lamp.",2,3
ross,"Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?",2,3
phoebe,Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.,2,3
ross,Please tell me you are joking.,2,3
phoebe,"Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.",2,3
ross,"No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--",2,3
phoebe,"What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.",2,3
ross,Is there blood coming out of my ears?,2,3
joey,"Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.",2,3
chandler,"Wow, he looks so normal.",2,3
phoebe,He's even kind of cute.,2,3
joey,"""Heckles, you crack me up in science class. you are the funniest kid in school.",2,3
chandler,Funniest? Heckles?,2,3
joey,that is what it says.,2,3
chandler,"Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?",2,3
phoebe,I'd call that excessive.,2,3
chandler,Whoa!,2,3
joey,What?,2,3
chandler,"Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.",2,3
joey,"So, you were both dorks. Big deal.",2,3
chandler,"I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?",2,3
joey,Have you been here all night?,2,3
chandler,"Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm going to end up alone, just like he did.",2,3
joey,"Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.",2,3
chandler,"Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.",2,3
joey,"All right, you know what we got to do? We got to get you out of here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.",2,3
chandler,"What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it ""supposably""?",2,3
joey,"Chandler, come on, you are going to find somebody.",2,3
chandler,How do you know that? How?,2,3
joey,"I don't know, I'm just trying' to help you out.",2,3
chandler,"You'll see, you guys are all going to go off and get married, and I'm going to end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you are married, will you invite me over for holidays?",2,3
joey,"Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're going to be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?",2,3
chandler,"Yeah, I understand.",2,3
joey,"You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?",2,3
chandler,You know what? I'm not going to end up like this. I'll see you man.,2,3
joey,Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.,2,3
chandler,"Hi, it's me.",2,3
janice,"Oh, my, god.",2,3
phoebe,Janice? You called Janice?,2,3
chandler,"Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?",2,3
ross,"You remember Janice, right?",2,3
chandler,"Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.",2,3
janice,Hello!!,2,3
chandler,"Oh, my, god!",2,3
joey,"Geez, look how fat she got.",2,3
janice,"Hey, it's everybody.",2,3
chandler,"Janice, you are--",2,3
janice,"Yes, I am.",2,3
chandler,Is it--?,2,3
janice,"Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.",2,3
chandler,Congratulations.,2,3
janice,"Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.",2,3
chandler,You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?,2,3
janice,And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.,2,3
monica,"Hey, Rach. You know what we haven't played in a while?",2,3
rachel,What?,2,3
monica,Hide the Lamp.,2,3
rachel,"Monica, let it go.",2,3
monica,Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?,2,3
rachel,"Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.",2,3
phoebe,Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.,2,3
ross,"Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.",2,3
phoebe,"Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.",2,3
ross,"It's the only possibility, Phoebe.",2,3
phoebe,"Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?",2,3
ross,"There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.",2,3
phoebe,I can't believe you caved.,2,3
ross,What?,2,3
phoebe,"You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?",2,3
rachel,I am. Let me just get my coat.,2,3
monica,"Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.",2,3
rachel,"Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?",2,3
monica,"Phoebe, tell her!",2,3
phoebe,"Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.",2,3
rachel,Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.,2,3
chandler,Neat. I'm going to die alone.,2,3
rachel,"Ok, you win.",2,3
monica,"Chandler, you are not going to die alone.",2,3
chandler,"Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.",2,3
phoebe,Uh huh. Why is that?,2,3
chandler,"If I'm going to be an old, lonely man, I'm going to need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. ""Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"" they'll shout!",2,3
monica,You have got to get over this. you are not going to end up alone.,2,3
chandler,"Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.",2,3
rachel,"Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.",2,3
monica,You are not a freak. you are a guy.,2,3
rachel,She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.,2,3
monica,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.",2,3
chandler,In a bad way?,2,3
monica,"No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.",2,3
rachel,Yeah. you are not going to end up alone.,2,3
phoebe,"Chandler, you called Janice! that is how much you wanted to be with someone!",2,3
monica,You made it!,2,3
phoebe,you are there!,2,3
rachel,You are ready to make a commitment!,2,3
chandler,Whoa! Don't know about that.,2,3
rachel,What you got there? Something else that is not yours that you can break?,2,3
monica,"No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.",2,3
rachel,Thank you.,2,3
monica,that is fine.,2,3
chandler,"Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not going to let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.",2,3
joey,"Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?",2,3
chandler,I'll take that.,2,3
joey,You want his yearbook?,2,3
chandler,"Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.",2,3
monica,"Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. you are all going to hell.",2,3
rachel,It's really not that big!,2,3
chandler,"Takin' that with you, huh?",2,3
joey,"Oh, yeah.",2,3
ross,You coming'?,2,3
chandler,"Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.",2,3
alison,"Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see ""Philosopher wanted""?",2,3
chandler,Sure.,2,3
ross,"Man, I sure miss Julie.",2,5
chandler,"Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.",2,5
ross,You ever figure out what that thing's for?,2,5
chandler,"No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people will think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.",2,5
jade,"Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you are still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kind of hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?",2,5
chandler,What?,2,5
jade,I got a little drunk...and naked.,2,5
chandler,Bob here.,2,5
chandler,What've you been up to?,2,5
jade,"Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.",2,5
chandler,Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.,2,5
ross,I know.,2,5
chandler,I'm back.,2,5
jade,"So, are we going to get together or what?",2,5
chandler,"Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?",2,5
jade,"Great, I'll see you then.",2,5
chandler,Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.,2,5
ross,"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinking' when she sees you tomorrow, she's probably going to realize, ""hey, you are not Bob.""",2,5
chandler,"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.",2,5
ross,Oh my god. You are pure evil.,2,5
chandler,"Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.",2,5
ross,"Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.",2,5
all,"Hi, Julie!",2,5
rachel,"Hi, Julie.",2,5
chandler,"Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.",2,5
phoebe,"Um, is, is there any chance that you are rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?",2,5
chandler,"Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.",2,5
joey,Do we need a cake?,2,5
chandler,"Look guys, I know it's a little steep.",2,5
rachel,"Yeah, whoosh!",2,5
chandler,But it's Ross.,2,5
phoebe,It's Ross.,2,5
joey,All right.,2,5
chandler,"I'll see you guys later, I got to go...do a thing.",2,5
ross,"Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you are not really going to go through with this, are you?",2,5
chandler,"You know, I think I might just.",2,5
rachel,"So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?",2,5
joey,"Well I guess I got to start saving' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.",2,5
phoebe,Can you believe how much this is going to cost?,2,5
rachel,"Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?",2,5
joey,"Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying ""let's go here, let's go there"". Like we can afford to go here and there.",2,5
phoebe,"Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, Because, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.",2,5
joey,For Ross.,2,5
rachel,"For Ross, Ross, Ross.",2,5
monica,Oh my god.,2,5
rachel,Hey.,2,5
joey,Hi.,2,5
rachel,What?,2,5
monica,"I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, saute, saute, saute. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.",2,5
joey,"If it's not you, this is a horrible story.",2,5
monica,"Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.",2,5
joey,"Yeah, someplace nice.  How much do you think I can get for my kidney?",2,5
ross,I'm telling' you. You can't do this.,2,5
chandler,"Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.",2,5
ross,"That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.",2,5
chandler,"We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.",2,5
ross,Go over there and tell that woman the truth.,2,5
chandler,All right.,2,5
ross,Go.,2,5
chandler,Hi.,2,5
jade,Hi.,2,5
chandler,"Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.",2,5
jade,Yes?,2,5
chandler,Whoever stood you up is a jerk.,2,5
jade,How did you--?,2,5
chandler,"I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that is me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?",2,5
jade,Thanks.,2,5
chandler,"No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.",2,5
ross,"Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--",2,5
monica,Who is also in charge of purchasing.,2,5
ross,Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--,2,5
monica,Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.,2,5
ross,"Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--",2,5
monica,"Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!",2,5
joey,Cool.,2,5
phoebe,Let's see!,2,5
ross,"that is fine, I'll just wait!",2,5
monica,"Oh, sorry.",2,5
joey,"Sorry, sorry.",2,5
ross,Monica!,2,5
waiter,Are we ready to order?,2,5
rachel,"Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.",2,5
waiter,"Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.",2,5
phoebe,"Wow, look at these prices.",2,5
rachel,"Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.",2,5
joey,"What are these, like famous chickens?",2,5
chandler,"Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.  I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?",2,5
ross,"Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?",2,5
chandler,"Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.",2,5
ross,"Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?",2,5
waiter,Do I dare ask?,2,5
monica,"Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.",2,5
ross,That sounds great. Same for me.,2,5
waiter,And for the gentleman?,2,5
joey,"Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?",2,5
waiter,"You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?",2,5
rachel,"Ok, I will have the uh,  side salad.",2,5
waiter,And what will that be on the side of?,2,5
rachel,"Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?",2,5
waiter,And for you?,2,5
phoebe,"Um, I'm going to have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.",2,5
chandler,"I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.",2,5
waiter,Anything else?,2,5
chandler,"Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. you are going to sneeze on my fish, aren't you?",2,5
ross,"Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.",2,5
rachel,"Um, everyone?",2,5
ross,"Oh, you are right, I'm sorry.",2,5
joey,Thank you.,2,5
ross,"Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.",2,5
monica,"Oh, thank you!",2,5
ross,"So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.",2,5
phoebe,"No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not going to happen.",2,5
chandler,"Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.",2,5
phoebe,"I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...",2,5
ross,"Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.",2,5
phoebe,Not for you.,2,5
monica,"All right, what's going' on?",2,5
rachel,"Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.",2,5
phoebe,"Fine. All right, fine.",2,5
joey,Yeah.,2,5
chandler,You can tell us.,2,5
ross,"Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.",2,5
joey,"Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.",2,5
monica,Ok.,2,5
ross,I hear you.,2,5
chandler,We can talk about that.,2,5
phoebe,"Well, then...Let's.",2,5
ross,"I, I just never think of money as an issue.",2,5
rachel,that is Because you have it.,2,5
ross,that is a good point.,2,5
chandler,"So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?",2,5
joey,"Because it's always something', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.",2,5
ross,"What--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's going to be a hoopla?",2,5
rachel,"Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.",2,5
monica,"If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.",2,5
ross,G-gift? The thing's not the gift?,2,5
chandler,"No, the thing was, we were going to go see Hootie and the Blowfish.",2,5
ross,"Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.",2,5
phoebe,"No, now I feel bad. You want to go to the concert.",2,5
ross,"No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.",2,5
monica,All of us.,2,5
chandler,Together.,2,5
ross,Not at the concert.,2,5
rachel,Ok.,2,5
joey,Yeah.,2,5
rachel,Thank you.,2,5
joey,Thanks.,2,5
phoebe,Yeah.,2,5
chandler,"So, the Ebola virus. that is got to suck, huh?",2,5
chandler,"Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?",2,5
monica,"I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.",2,5
phoebe,"Oh, it's like a skit.",2,5
monica,"Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.",2,5
ross,Who!,2,5
phoebe,Cool.,2,5
monica,"Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.",2,5
ross,"But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?",2,5
chandler,"By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.",2,5
ross,Come on.,2,5
chandler,"Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!",2,5
monica,"It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.",2,5
phoebe,So...Thank you.,2,5
ross,Could you be less enthused?,2,5
joey,"Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--",2,5
monica,Like?,2,5
joey,Charity.,2,5
monica,Charity?,2,5
ross,We're just trying' to do a nice thing here.,2,5
rachel,"Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.",2,5
phoebe,"Actually, it makes us feel that big.",2,5
ross,"I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.",2,5
chandler,"If you guys feel this big, maybe that is not our fault. Maybe that is just how you feel.",2,5
joey,"Oh, now you are telling' us how you feel.",2,5
rachel,"Ok, we never should have talked about this.",2,5
phoebe,"I'm just going to pass on the concert, Because I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.",2,5
rachel,Me neither.,2,5
joey,Me too.,2,5
monica,"Guys, we bought the tickets.",2,5
phoebe,"Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.",2,5
chandler,Why did you look at me when you said that?,2,5
monica,"Well, I guess now we can't go.",2,5
rachel,"What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?",2,5
monica,You know what? you are right.,2,5
phoebe,Fine.,2,5
ross,Fine.,2,5
joey,Fine.,2,5
chandler,Fine.,2,5
rachel,Fine.,2,5
monica,All right. We're going to go. It's not for another six hours. We're going to go then.,2,5
ross,Chandler!,2,5
chandler,Yeah?,2,5
ross,Geez! Are you ready?,2,5
chandler,Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.,2,5
ross,Whoa! You had sex today?,2,5
chandler,"Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.",2,5
ross,Wow.,2,5
chandler,"Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.",2,5
ross,Still doing the screening thing?,2,5
chandler,I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.,2,5
machine,"Here comes the beep, you know what to do.",2,5
jade,"Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.",2,5
chandler,Bob here.,2,5
jade,"Oh, hi.",2,5
chandler,"So, uh, you met someone, huh?",2,5
jade,"Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.",2,5
chandler,"So, uh, how was he?",2,5
jade,Eh.,2,5
chandler,Eh?,2,5
jade,"Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.",2,5
chandler,"Well, that makes me feel so good.",2,5
jade,It was just so awkward and bumpy.,2,5
ross,Bumpy?,2,5
chandler,"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you are not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.",2,5
jade,"Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?",2,5
monica,You know what? I'm not going to be able to enjoy this.,2,5
ross,"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.",2,5
chandler,"So, let's go.",2,5
ross,"Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.",2,5
chandler,"Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.",2,5
monica,"You know, the guys are probably having a great time.",2,5
joey,"Come on you guys, one more time.",2,5
phoebe,Ok. One.,2,5
joey,No.,2,5
monica,That was amazing!,2,5
ross,"Excellent, that was excellent.",2,5
chandler,I can't believe the guys missed this.,2,5
ross,"What guys? Oh, yeah.",2,5
steve,"Excuse me, you are Monica Geller aren't you?",2,5
monica,Do I know you?,2,5
steve,You used to be my babysitter.,2,5
monica,"Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?",2,5
steve,"Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.",2,5
monica,You can't be a lawyer. you are eight.,2,5
steve,"Listen, it was nice to see you. I got to run backstage.",2,5
monica,"Uh, wait, backstage?",2,5
steve,"Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.",2,5
ross,Ross.,2,5
chandler,Chandler.,2,5
steve,"How are you? Look, you guys want to meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?",2,5
ross,"Hey, you guys.",2,5
rachel,Happy birthday.,2,5
ross,"Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?",2,5
rachel,"Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?",2,5
monica,"Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?",2,5
rachel,"Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?",2,5
monica,"Uh, good.",2,5
ross,"Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.",2,5
chandler,"Yeah, we really missed you guys.",2,5
joey,"Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.",2,5
phoebe,"We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?",2,5
monica,"No, I just, I fell down.",2,5
rachel,On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?,2,5
monica,"You know, a party, or--",2,5
rachel,What party?,2,5
ross,"It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.",2,5
joey,You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?,2,5
chandler,"Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.",2,5
rachel,Who gave you that hickey?,2,5
monica,That would be the work of a Blowfish.,2,5
rachel,Oh!,2,5
phoebe,"Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, ""hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck"".",2,5
ross,"Look, don't blame us. You guys could have been there, you know.",2,5
rachel,"What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?",2,5
monica,It's work.,2,5
chandler,I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not going to feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.,2,5
joey,And we don't work hard?,2,5
monica,"Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.",2,5
chandler,I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.,2,5
joey,And you feel like we hold you back.,2,5
chandler,Yes.,2,5
rachel,Oh!,2,5
chandler,No.,2,5
monica,"Leon, Leon. Shh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.",2,5
phoebe,Oh.,2,5
waitress,Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.,2,5
joey,Let me get that.  You got five bucks?,2,5
machine,"Here comes the beep, you know what to do.",2,5
jade,"Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you are probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...",2,5
ross,"Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?  RACH",2,7
rachel,"Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . ",2,7
rachel,"And you know what, now I've got closure. ",2,7
rachel,Ross kissed me.,2,8
monica,"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!",2,8
rachel,It was unbelievable!,2,8
monica,"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!",2,8
phoebe,"Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?",2,8
rachel,"Oh, it ended very well.",2,8
phoebe,Oh.,2,8
monica,Do not start without me. Do not start without me.,2,8
phoebe,"Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a ""I got to have you now"" kind of thing?",2,8
rachel,"Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.",2,8
phoebe,"Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?",2,8
rachel,"No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.",2,8
phoebe/monica,oh.,2,8
ross,"And, uh, and then I kissed her.",2,8
joey,Tongue?,2,8
ross,Yeah.,2,8
joey,Cool.,2,8
chandler,"All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.",2,8
phoebe,Wow. What are you going to use it for?,2,8
chandler,Games and stuff.,2,8
monica,There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.,2,8
joey,"Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?",2,8
monica,There's an ad for a naked chef?,2,8
joey,"No, but if you are willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then…",2,8
ross,Hi.,2,8
phoebe,"Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?",2,8
ross,"That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that is just painful",2,8
monica,Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.,2,8
ross,"Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just going to throw all that away?",2,8
joey,You got all that from saline solution?,2,8
monica,We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.,2,8
ross,"Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.",2,8
rachel,"Hey, you.",2,8
ross,How are you?,2,8
rachel,Good. How are you?,2,8
ross,Good.,2,8
julie,"Hi, honey.",2,8
ross,"Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?",2,8
julie,Good.,2,8
ross,"Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you going to play something, Phoebe?",2,8
phoebe,"Oh, well, actually.",2,8
ross,Play it.,2,8
phoebe,"Ok, all right.",2,8
joey,"Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.",2,8
julie,What?,2,8
ross,Shh.,2,8
phoebe,"Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, ""Two of Them Kissed Last Night"".",2,8
phoebe,"There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!",2,8
rtst,"This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.",2,8
monica,"So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.",2,8
rtst,Mockolate.,2,8
monica,I'm sorry?,2,8
rtst,Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.,2,8
monica,OH.,2,8
rtst,"Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.",2,8
monica,All right. Mmm-mmm.,2,8
rtst,Yeah?,2,8
monica,"I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.",2,8
rtst,"No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays",2,8
monica,Mmm-mmm.,2,8
rtst,"But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.",2,8
monica,Wow.,2,8
rtst,Aren't you going to swallow that?,2,8
monica,Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.,2,8
rtst,"Yeah, isn't that great?",2,8
monica,Mmm.,2,8
rtst,"Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?",2,8
monica,"Absolutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.",2,8
rtst,Really?,2,8
monica,"Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell you, that'll last you till Christmas.",2,8
monica,How about Mockolate mousse?,2,8
phoebe,"It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.",2,8
monica,"Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?",2,8
phoebe,What makes it pilgrim?,2,8
monica,We'll put buckles on it.,2,8
rachel,Hey.,2,8
phoebe,Hey.,2,8
monica,Hey.,2,8
rachel,"Did uh, Ross call?",2,8
monica,"No, I'm sorry.",2,8
rachel,"Why didn't he call? He's going to stay with Julie, isn't he? He's going to stay with her and she's going to be all, ""Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're going to to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together.""",2,8
phoebe,"No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.",2,8
ross,"I don't know what to do. What am I going to do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.",2,8
chandler,"Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.",2,8
joey,"Hey, here's a thought, Ross.",2,8
chandler,Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.,2,8
joey,"Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.",2,8
chandler,"Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.",2,8
ross,Can't we just use a pen?,2,8
chandler,"No, Amish boy.",2,8
joey,"Ok, let's start with the cons, Because they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.",2,8
ross,"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.",2,8
joey,You could say that.,2,8
ross,"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common Because we're both palaeontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.",2,8
chandler,Waitress. Got it. You guys want to play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?,2,8
ross,I don't know.,2,8
joey,"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.",2,8
chandler,"Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?",2,8
ross,She's not Rachel.,2,8
monica,"Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.",2,8
rachel,Oh my god.,2,8
monica,Oh my god good?,2,8
rachel,"Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.",2,8
phoebe,"Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!",2,8
chandler,"I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?",2,8
joey,"Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?",2,8
ross,"Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.",2,8
chandler,"So, Spock actually hugs his father?",2,8
rachel,"Hey, do you guys have......hi.",2,8
ross,Hi.,2,8
rachel,Where you going'?,2,8
ross,"I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.",2,8
rachel,Oh.,2,8
ross,"No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.",2,8
rachel,"Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?",2,8
ross,"Well, uh.",2,8
joey,"He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.",2,8
rachel,Really?,2,8
ross,"Really. It's always been you, Rach.",2,8
rachel,"Oh, god.",2,8
joey/chan,oh.,2,8
rachel,"Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.",2,8
ross,"I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?",2,8
rachel,Let me get my coat.,2,8
ross,"Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.",2,8
rachel,"Ok, he's going' to get my coat. He's going' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?",2,8
chandler,What? Nothing.,2,8
rachel,What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?,2,8
chandler,"No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!",2,8
rachel,Well what is it? Let me see.,2,8
ross,"Hey, someone order a coat?",2,8
rachel,"Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.",2,8
ross,"He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?",2,8
chandler,"Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.",2,8
rachel,And I'm in it? Then let me read it.,2,8
"chandler, joey, ross",No!,2,8
rachel,Come on.,2,8
joey,"Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?",2,8
chandler,"Alright. ""It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end.""",2,8
ross,that is it? that is all you wrote? you are the worst writer in the whole world.,2,8
rachel,"All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.",2,8
ross,"No, you don't.",2,8
rachel,"All right, you know what, that is fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that is fine. I do not need to see it.",2,8
rachel,"What is this? Ross, what is this?",2,8
chandler,Good luck.,2,8
ross,"Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?",2,8
rachel,Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?,2,8
ross,"Now that is a little spoiled. He was supposed to type ""little"", the idiot.",2,8
rachel,Just a waitress?,2,8
ross,"No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?",2,8
rachel,Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!,2,8
ross,"No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.",2,8
rachel,She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid palaeontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.,2,8
ross,"No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?",2,8
chandler,"My diary! My diary, that is brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.",2,8
monica,"You know, that is true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.",2,8
phoebe,I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.,2,8
joey,"Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.",2,8
phoebe,What?,2,8
monica,What?,2,8
chandler,"Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.",2,8
monica,This was your idea?,2,8
phoebe,What were you thinking?,2,8
chandler,"All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.",2,8
monica,Yeah. You!,2,8
chandler,"All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?",2,8
phoebe,"Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.",2,8
ross,"Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!",2,8
rachel,"When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.",2,8
ross,I just want to read something. It's your pro list.,2,8
rachel,Not interested.,2,8
ross,"Ok, ok, number one",2,8
ross,Number six,2,8
joey,"Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?",2,8
ross,"Hey, Joey. You want to open the window?",2,8
joey,"Oh, yeah, I do.",2,8
chandler,What are you doing out there?,2,8
ross,"I am, uh, I am...",2,8
monica,"Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?",2,8
ross,"Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.",2,8
rachel,No.,2,8
ross,No?,2,8
rachel,that is what I said.,2,8
chandler,"Look, maybe we should go?",2,8
rachel,"No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.",2,8
ross,"Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.",2,8
rachel,"No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.",2,8
ross,"No, but, but I want to be with you in spite of all those things.",2,8
rachel,"Oh, well, that is, that is mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!",2,8
ross,"You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.",2,8
rachel,"Well, then, I guess that is the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.",2,8
joey,"I never know how long you are supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.",2,8
monica,"Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.",2,8
rtst,Doesn't matter.,2,8
monica,What?,2,8
rtst,Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.,2,8
monica,"Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.",2,8
rtst,"Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?",2,8
monica,"Well, uh, I ate some.",2,8
rtst,"Oh, some, that is fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?",2,8
monica,Hello?,2,8
ross,Hi.,2,8
rachel,"Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighing' me down.",2,8
monica,"Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.",2,8
ross,"Look, can, can you do something for me?",2,8
monica,"Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?",2,8
radio,"The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.",2,8
radio,"Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you are listening, I don't want to play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.",2,8
rtst,"Hi, thanks for coming in again.",2,8
monica,"Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.",2,8
rtst,"It's like I'm looking' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called ""fishtachios"". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. you are not allergic to anything, are you?",2,8
monica,Cat hair.,2,8
rtst,"Oh, sorry.",2,8
ross,"Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.  RACHEL",2,9
ross,"Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.  MONICA",2,9
mr. treeger,"Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.  ROSS",2,9
joey,They're ribbed for your pleasure.,2,9
rachel,"Joey, would you slow down? They're not going to be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.",2,10
joey,I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.,2,10
monica,"You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.",2,10
phoebe,"Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.",2,10
joey,"Here it is, here it is. The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.",2,10
chandler,"OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Pheebs, read yours.",2,10
phoebe,"OK. The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...",2,10
chandler,"Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours.",2,10
ross,I don't want to.,2,10
rachel,"Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.",2,10
ross,Yeah.,2,10
joey,Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's got to be a reason.,2,10
ross,"Oh c'mon. Maybe you are just, uhhh... paying your dues.",2,10
joey,"No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.",2,10
monica,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind. In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiani was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153… sucking.",2,10
joey,"When I was little, I wanted to be a veterinarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.",2,10
ross,Hi.,2,10
phoebe,Are... are you OK?,2,10
ross,"Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?",2,10
monica,Maybe.,2,10
ross,Don't toy with me.,2,10
fbob,Geller!,2,10
ross,"Hey, Fun Bobby!",2,10
fbob,"Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?",2,10
ross,"Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you are back with my sister!",2,10
monica,You and me both.,2,10
fbob,"Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?",2,10
phoebe,"Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.",2,10
fbob,"Hey, do you need me to pick you up?",2,10
joey,"No, I'm alright man. Really.",2,10
fbob,"No, I'm picking you up.",2,10
joey,"Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.",2,10
fbob,"OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still going to go.",2,10
monica,"OK, I'll see you later babe.",2,10
fbob,"Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.",2,10
fbob,See you.,2,10
all,Bye! See you later!,2,10
phoebe,Fun Bobby is so great.,2,10
monica,"Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.",2,10
phoebe,Half full of love.,2,10
monica,"And for our two-week anniversary, he's going to take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.",2,10
phoebe,Cabin of love.,2,10
rachel,"We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.",2,10
monica,Really? I only had two glasses.,2,10
joey,I just had a glass.,2,10
phoebe,Two.,2,10
rachel,I had one glass.,2,10
chandler,I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.,2,10

ross,Ooh.,2,10
joey, Ooh.,2,10
monica,So what. So he drank a lot tonight.,2,10
ross,"Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.",2,10
phoebe,"Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was so wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were so bombed,' or, um, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'",2,10
joey,"Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?",2,10
monica,"Well, we just happen to go to a lot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.",2,10
monica,"Rach, does this have non fat milk?",2,10
rachel,"Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.",2,10

monica,You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.,2,10
fbob,"Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.",2,10
monica,Bobby.,2,10
fbob,"Yeah, OK.",2,10
monica,"Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.",2,10
fbob,"OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'",2,10
monica,"So, what are you saying now?",2,10
fbob,"I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kind of like that you worry about me.",2,10
phoebe,"Sooo, what's going' on, huh?",2,10
fbob,I am going to try and quit drinking.,2,10

joey,"Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!",2,10
phoebe,"Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.",2,10
chandler,"Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.",2,10
phoebe,"Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all going to do something tonight.",2,10
rachel,"Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kind of got plans.",2,10
monica,You have other friends?,2,10
rachel,"Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.",2,10
monica,What?,2,10
joey,With a man?,2,10
rachel,What? What is so strange about me having a date?,2,10
joey,"What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?",2,10
rachel,"No, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.",2,10
monica,What are you talking about?,2,10
rachel,"I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.",2,10
phoebe,But you guys came so close.,2,10
rachel,"Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. you are just going to have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.",2,10
rachel,"Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.",2,10
russ,hi.,2,10
estl,"Stop saying you are not talented, you are very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will you? Ooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.",2,10
estl,"Well, there's my favourite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?",2,10
joey,"Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a call-back for Thursday.",2,10
estl,"Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?",2,10
joey,No.,2,10
estl,"Well, here it is.",2,10
joey,"OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...",2,10
estl,"Oh, isn't Lori a doll?",2,10
joey,"Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kind of got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.",2,10
estl,"Oh, I see. Well, I'm just going to put in a call here and we'll find out what's going' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you are going to have to sleep with her.",2,10
rachel,What's the matter?,2,10
monica,It's Fun Bobby.,2,10

monica,"Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.",2,10
rachel,"oh, OK.",2,10
monica,"Alright, here you go, sweetie.",2,10
fbob,Thanks. You want to hear something funny?,2,10
monica,"Oh God, yes!",2,10
fbob,There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.,2,10
phoebe,That is funny.,2,10
fbob,"I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walking' around the neighbourhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.",2,10
monica,"Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?",2,10
fbob,Oh yeah. See you guys.,2,10
chandler,Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.,2,10
monica,Oh.... my... God.,2,10
phoebe,It's not that bad.,2,10
monica,Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?,2,10
phoebe,"OK, OK, don't get all squinky.",2,10
rachel,Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.,2,10
monica,"But I'm going to be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.",2,10
phoebe,"Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.",2,10
russ,Hi.,2,10
chandler,Hey Ross.... bahhhh!,2,10
rachel,"Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?",2,10

ross,A date.,2,10
russ,"Yeah, I'm her date.",2,10
ross,"Oh, oh, you are... uh... you are, oh you are the date.",2,10

rachel,Oh.,2,10
ross,"Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.",2,10
rachel,"Well, we're not seeing each other, so....",2,10
ross,"Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...",2,10
rachel,"Well, yeah, this is the deal.",2,10
ross,"OK, well, um, have a nice evening.",2,10
rachel,"Um, Russ, you ready?",2,10
russ,Yeah.,2,10
rachel,Bye.,2,10
monica,Bye.,2,10
phoebe,Bye.,2,10
ross,She's dating. She's dating.,2,10
chandler,"Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?",2,10
ross,What do you mean?,2,10
monica,Do you not see it?,2,10
ross,"See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.",2,10
chandler,"Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?",2,10
ross,....................Yeah.,2,10
chandler,Hey.,2,10
joey,Hey.,2,10
chandler,"Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.",2,10
joey,"Well, the part's mine if I want it.",2,10
chandler,Oh my God!,2,10
joey,"Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.",2,10
chandler,Oh my... God?,2,10
joey,"Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. that is actually on television.",2,10
chandler,"So, what're you going to do?",2,10
joey,"Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?",2,10
chandler,"Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.",2,10
joey,I've never slept with someone for a part.,2,10
chandler,Well is she…,2,10
joey,Sorry.,2,10
chandler,It's alright. Is she good-looking?,2,10
joey,"Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.",2,10
chandler,"You know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. You know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. you know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.",2,10
joey,"I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, you know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always going to look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. you know, the Little General.",2,10
chandler,Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?,2,10
joey,"Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.",2,10
waiter,Can I get you something from the bar?,2,10
monica,"Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.",2,10
fbob,"If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.",2,10
monica,"No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.",2,10
fbob,So the light went out in my refrigerator...,2,10
monica,I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.,2,10
chandler,"Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? want to do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.",2,10
russ,Dysprosium.,2,10
ross,Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.,2,10
chandler,"And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.",2,10
phoebe,You don't see it? You actually don't see it?,2,10
rachel,What?,2,10
phoebe,"OK honey, you are dating Ross.",2,10
rachel,"No, Pheebs. I'm dating Russ.",2,10
phoebe,Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!,2,10
rachel,Steve... sleeve!,2,10
phoebe,"OK, no one is named Sleeve.",2,10
rachel,"Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you are seeing.",2,10
ross,"For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.",2,10
russ,You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.,2,10
chandler,"OK, I'm going to get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.",2,10
russ,I know what your problem is.,2,10
ross,"Oh you do, do you?",2,10
russ,"Um-hum, you are jealous.",2,10
ross,Of... of what?,2,10
russ,you are jealous because I'm a real doctor.,2,10
ross,"Hey, you are a doctor of gums. that is the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.",2,10
russ,"Hey, you listen.",2,10
ross,"No, no, let me finish.",2,10
russ,"No, let me finish.",2,10
ross,"No, you let me fini...",2,10
ross,Hi.,2,10
russ,Hi.,2,10
rachel,"Eww, Eww, Eww, Eww!",2,10
rachel,Did Joey say what he was going to go when he left?,2,10
chandler,"No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?",2,10
rachel,I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?,2,10
chandler,Me.,2,10
rachel,Why would I have to sleep with you?,2,10
chandler,It's my game. You want the job or not?,2,10
chandler,Hey.,2,10
monica,Morning.,2,10
ross,Where you going'?,2,10
monica,"Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?",2,10
ross,Ooh.,2,10
phoebe,What's with all the bottles of liquor?,2,10
ross,"What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?",2,10
monica,"Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.",2,10
rachel,"Oh God, even his knock is boring.",2,10
monica,Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.,2,10
fbob,"Uh, can I talk to you a minute?",2,10
monica,Sure.,2,10
fbob,This is really hard for me to say.,2,10
monica,"Oh God, you fell off the wagon.",2,10
fbob,"Oh, no, no, it's about you.",2,10
monica,What about me?,2,10
fbob,I think you may have a drinking problem.,2,10
monica,"What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.",2,10
fbob,"Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a co-dependent relationship right now, OK?",2,10
monica,Oh... shoot.,2,10
fbob,"Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.",2,10
monica,OK.,2,10
monica,Take care.,2,10
fbob,You too.,2,10
rachel,What happened?,2,10
monica,Well we... we kind of broke up.,2,10
gang,Awwwwwwww.,2,10
monica,Does anybody want these?,2,10
chandler,I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.,2,10
joey,Hey.,2,10
gang,Hey!,2,10
ross,How'd the call-back go?,2,10
joey,It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.,2,10
chandler,So what'd you do?,2,10
joey,"Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.",2,10
ross,Good for you.,2,10
joey,"But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.",2,10
phoebe,So... and?,2,10
joey,"So... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!",2,10
gang,All right!,2,10
joey,Alright... I've got to go shower.,2,10
russ,Hi.,2,10
chandler,"Oh, hey.",2,10
phoebe,Hi.,2,10
russ,"I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.",2,10
chandler,"Yeah, I'm sorry man.",2,10
russ,"Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?",2,10
phoebe,"Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.",2,10
russ,Oh.,2,10
julie,Hey.,2,10
chandler,Hey!,2,10
phoebe,"Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?",2,10
julie,"Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....",2,10
ross,"Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!",2,11
carol,So how did everything go?,2,11
ross,"Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.",2,11
carol,"Well, we've got to go.",2,11
ross,Ok.,2,11
susan,,2,11
carol,"Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.",2,11
ross,"Oh, you and me?",2,11
carol,"Uh, no, Susan and me.",2,11
susan,The other us.,2,11
ross,Ok.,2,11
carol,"We're uh, we're getting married.",2,11
ross,"As in, ""I now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?",2,11
carol,"Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.",2,11
ross,Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.,2,11
carol,Look I just thought that...,2,11
ross,"No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!",2,11
susan,Is your finger caught in that chair?,2,11
ross,Mmm hmmm.,2,11
carol,Want us to go?,2,11
ross,Uh-huh.,2,11
ross,This is so cool. you are actually going to be on television.,2,11
joey,"It really hit me last night. I'm going to be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinking' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..",2,11
monica,"Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.",2,11
"ross, chandler & joey",Yes!,2,11
monica,"They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?",2,11
ross,Would it matter?,2,11
monica,"Oh, you are so great! Thank you!",2,11
joey,Are you really not going?,2,11
ross,"I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?",2,11
monica,"They love each other, and they want to celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.",2,11
ross,If you want to call that a reason.,2,11
chandler,"Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbour.",2,11
monica,"Ross, I thought you were over this.",2,11
ross,"Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.",2,11
joey,"Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.",2,11
rachel,Did I miss it? Did I miss it?,2,11
joey,"No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.",2,11
chandler,"Whoa, she's pretty.",2,11
joey,"Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.",2,11
rachel,"I'm sorry, what?",2,11
monica,What?,2,11
joey,"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you are thinking' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.",2,11
chandler,"Oh, ok.",2,11
joey,"There's my scene, there's my scene. ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.",2,11
mrs. wallace,Is she going to be all right?,2,11
joey,I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.,2,11
chandler,Nice!,2,11
rachel,that is great!,2,11
ross,Excellent!,2,11
chandler,For a minute there I thought you were actually trying' to smell something.,2,11
ross,That is so good! Do it again!,2,11
joey,"All right, all right. ""Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!""",2,11
chandler,"that is great. All right, I got to get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.",2,11
ross,"No no, that is me.",2,11
chandler,"Oh, yeah.",2,11
ross,"Oh, hello.",2,11
phoebe,"Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...",2,11
ross,Is everything ok?,2,11
phoebe,"Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.",2,11
ross,Oh my god.,2,11
chandler,that is a little more relaxed than you want them to get.,2,11
phoebe,"Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.",2,11
monica,"Oh, honey.",2,11
phoebe,"Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."" Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that is it."" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.",2,11
rachel,What do you mean?,2,11
phoebe,I think it went into me.,2,11
monica,"God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.",2,11
chandler,"Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.",2,11
rachel,"Ok, who ordered what?",2,11
ross,"Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.",2,11
chandler,"Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?",2,11
rachel,Oh god.,2,11
joey,I can't believe you are so uptight about your mom coming'.,2,11
rachel,"I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?",2,11
phoebe,Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.,2,11
joey,"Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady will be with us?",2,11
phoebe,"I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!",2,11
mrs. green,There she is.,2,11
rachel,Mom!,2,11
mrs green,"Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that is the fun.",2,11
rachel,Pretty much.,2,11
mrs green,"Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.",2,11
rachel,"This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.",2,11
mrs green,"Oh hello, Ross.",2,11
ross,"Hi, Mrs. Green.",2,11
mrs green,"So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?",2,11
rachel,Oh Mom!,2,11
mrs green,"If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.",2,11
chandler,"Believe me, sometimes that happens.",2,11
mrs green,"This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.",2,11
rachel,Really?,2,11
mrs green,Yes.,2,11
phoebe,"I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that is before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.",2,11
joey,"Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?",2,11
phoebe,I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?,2,11
mrs green,"Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.",2,11
rachel,"Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.",2,11
mrs green,"You have some life here, sweetie.",2,11
rachel,"I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?",2,11
mrs green,"I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.",2,11
rachel,For...me.,2,11
mrs green,"Well, not just for you.",2,11
rachel,"Well, what do you mean?",2,11
mrs green,"I'm uh, considering leaving your father.",2,11
monica,"All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.",2,11
rachel,Oh god. I think I'm going to be sick.,2,11
monica,Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.,2,11
ross,And you had no idea they weren't getting along?,2,11
rachel,None.,2,11
joey,They didn't fight a lot?,2,11
rachel,"No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?",2,11
phoebe,"In my day, divorce was not an option.",2,11
joey,"Hey, look who's up.",2,11
rachel,"I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.",2,11
monica,"Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.",2,11
rachel,"Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?",2,11
chandler,"You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kind of true.",2,11
phoebe,that is him.,2,11
chandler,Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.,2,11
mr a,Phoebe?,2,11
phoebe,"Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.",2,11
mr a,"Oh, that is all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.",2,11
phoebe,"Um, do you want to sit?",2,11
mr a,"Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?",2,11
phoebe,"I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.",2,11
mr a,"you are saying, my wife is in you?",2,11
phoebe,"Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?",2,11
mr a,"Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.",2,11
phoebe,Everything?,2,11
mr a,Everything.,2,11
phoebe,"Whoa, that is a lot of stuff.",2,11
mr a,"Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.",2,11
phoebe,"I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.",2,11
mr a,"Worth a shot, huh?",2,11
mrs green,Look at this.,2,11
rachel,These are from Halloween three years ago.,2,11
mrs green,"Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?",2,11
rachel,"No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.",2,11
monica,"Um, you guys, you know when I said before, ""thank you, but I don't really need your help""?",2,11
rachel,"Actually, what I think you said was, ""don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.""",2,11
monica,"Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.",2,11
rachel,"Hey, Mon, you want some help?",2,11
monica,If you want.,2,11
phoebe,"Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Centre, Statue of Liberty.",2,11
rachel,She's still with you?,2,11
phoebe,"Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.",2,11
mrs green,"This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?",2,11
rachel,God!,2,11
monica,"All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.",2,11
mrs green,"that is fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?",2,11
rachel,Oh! What's new in sex?,2,11
mrs green,The only man I've ever been with is your father.,2,11
monica,"I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.",2,11
mrs green,"I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.",2,11
rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?",2,11
mrs green,No.,2,11
rachel,You want me to talk you out of it?,2,11
mrs green,No.,2,11
rachel,Then what? What do you want?,2,11
mrs green,I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.,2,11
rachel,Why on earth would I understand this?,2,11
mrs green,You didn't marry your Barry. I did.,2,11
rachel,Oh.,2,11
monica,"All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!",2,11
chandler,"Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.",2,11
monica,"Joey, speed it up!",2,11
joey,"I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!",2,11
phoebe,"Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.",2,11
monica,Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you want to see me cry?,2,11
phoebe,Sir! No sir!,2,11
monica,"All right, you!",2,11
ross,"No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.",2,11
monica,"All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm going to take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm going to create a new appetizer called ""pigs in Ross"". All right, ball the melon.",2,11
chandler,"Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.",2,11
monica,Hi.,2,11
carol,How's it going?,2,11
monica,It's going' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.,2,11
carol,"Fine, whatever.",2,11
ross,What's the matter?,2,11
carol,"Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.",2,11
ross,What?,2,11
monica,"you are still going to pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.",2,11
ross,"Carol, what's the matter? What happened?",2,11
carol,My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.,2,11
ross,Oh my god.,2,11
carol,"I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.",2,11
ross,It's ok. I'm sorry.,2,11
carol,"And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.",2,11
ross,"I uh can't believe I'm going to say this, but I think Susan's right.",2,11
carol,You do?,2,11
ross,"Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.",2,11
carol,Of course I do.,2,11
ross,"Well then that is it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.",2,11
carol,you are right. Of course you are right.,2,11
monica,So we're back on?,2,11
carol,We're back on.,2,11
monica,"You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.",2,11
joey,"It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.",2,11
chandler,"Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.",2,11
phoebe,"Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.",2,11
carol,Thank you.,2,11
ross,Any time.,2,11
carol,Ross.,2,11
minister,"You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.",2,11
phoebe,"Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.",2,11
monica,Would you look at them?,2,11
ross,"Yeah, can't help but.",2,11
joey,How's that pig-in-the-blanket working' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.,2,11
phoebe,I miss Rose.,2,11
chandler,"Oh, yeah?",2,11
phoebe,"I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.",2,11
woman,"You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?",2,11
phoebe,"Ok, that is so nice.",2,11
chandler,"I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?",2,11
rachel,"Hey, Mom? Having fun?",2,11
mrs green,"Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I want to pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.",2,11
rachel,"There's more alcohol, right?",2,11
susan,How you doin'?,2,11
ross,Ok.,2,11
susan,You did a good thing today.,2,11
ross,Yeah.,2,11
susan,You want to dance?,2,11
ross,"No, that is fine.",2,11
susan,Come on. I'll let you lead.,2,11
ross,Ok.,2,11
chandler,All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.,2,11
monica,"Ok, which one of us do you think is going to be the first one to get married?",2,11
ross,"Well, Mon, I was married.",2,11
phoebe,"Yeah, me, too, technically.",2,11
rachel,I had a wedding.,2,11
monica,"All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.",2,11
joey,I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?,2,11
chandler,Isn't Ben in this?,2,11
all,"Oh, yeah!",2,11
commercial voiceover, Can't get the monkey off your back? Then put it in your mouth...,2,12
commercial voiceover, ...With MonkeyShine Beer.,2,12
ross, That commercial always makes me so sad.,2,12
joey," Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.",2,12
ross, I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.,2,12
phoebe," I can see that, Because they both have those big brown eyes and, you know, the little pouty chin.",2,12
monica, And the fact that they're both monkeys.,2,12
ross," Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, you know, giving him away.",2,12
rachel," Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.",2,12
ross," Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.",2,12
chandler," Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.",2,12
joey," Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.",2,12
chandler, Rhythm?,2,12
joey," No, my first fan mail.",2,12
all, Alright!,2,12
monica,"Dear Dr. Ramoray, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'",2,12
rachel," You know, in crazy world, that means you are married.",2,12
monica," This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.",2,12
joey," Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.",2,12
ross, Hey guys.,2,12
all, Hey.,2,12
phoebe," Ooh, where are you off to, Traveling' Jake?",2,12
ross," Well, there's this, uh, palaeontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.",2,12
chandler," You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.",2,12
rachel," Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.",2,12
phoebe," Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.",2,12
phoebe," I know, I know. Hello.",2,12

rob," I don't know anything about music, but I think you are really, really great.",2,12
phoebe," Oh, wow.",2,12
rob," Anyway, I schedule performers for the children's libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?",2,12
phoebe," Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you are, you are the, you are, me play the songs that I will write for them.",2,12
joey," Hey, what do you want to do for dinner?",2,12
chandler, Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.,2,12
chandler, Hello.,2,12
erica, It's Erica.,2,12
joey," Ah, the stalker.",2,12
erica," Never mind, it's open.",2,12
chandler,"Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might want to have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.",2,12
joey, Let's get out of here.,2,12
chandler, The one time they're not home.,2,12
joey," OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me Because we've never met.",2,12
chandler, that is how radio stars escape stalkers.,2,12
joey, She's coming'.,2,12
erica, It's me.,2,12
joey," Uhh, this is it, this is how we're going to die. Ready?",2,12
chandler," Wait, wait, wait.",2,12
erica, Hi.,2,12
joey, Erica.,2,12
lipson," Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.",2,12
ross," Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.",2,12
lipson," Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.",2,12
ross," Oh my God, what happened?",2,12
lipson," Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.",2,12
ross, I can't believe this.,2,12
lipson," I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But you know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.",2,12
ross," Well, you know, someone should have called me.",2,12
lipson," I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.",2,12
ross, Zoo dollars?,2,12
lipson," Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.",2,12
kids, Ooh.,2,12
phoebe, I know.,2,12
monica," I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.",2,12
chandler," Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?",2,12
rachel and monica, Yeah.,2,12
chandler," Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.",2,12
rachel, And she's not crazy?,2,12
chandler," Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.",2,12
rachel, Oh my God.,2,12
monica," Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not pursue this.",2,12
chandler," Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you looking' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.",2,12
rob, You OK?,2,12
phoebe," No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.",2,12
rob," that is not a good idea, that is kind of the reason the last guy got fired.",2,12
phoebe," I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. you know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, you know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you going to kiss me?",2,12
ross, I was thinking' about it.,2,12
phoebe," OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe",2,12
all, Hi Phoebe.,2,12
phoebe," OK, um, I'm going to play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK.",2,12
erica," Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?",2,12
joey, Yeah it is. . . what?,2,12
erica," Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.",2,12
joey," Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minutes.",2,12
erica, Who's they?,2,12
joey, No one.,2,12
erica," Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.",2,12
joey," Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.",2,12
erica," No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?",2,12
joey," Alright, just one. Wow, you are good at that.",2,12
waiter," Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?",2,12
erica," Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Ramoray.",2,12
janitor, Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.,2,12
ross," Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?",2,12
janitor, It's about your monkey. It's alive.,2,12
erica," I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?",2,12
joey," Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.",2,12
erica," No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Ramoray?",2,12
joey, But that is what...,2,12
erica, I should just be happy to be near you.,2,12
joey, Hey I- ,2,12
erica, Hey what?,2,12
joey," that is it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.",2,12
phoebe,There'll be times when you get older,2,12
monica, Excellent!,2,12
chandler, Very informative!,2,12
rachel, Not at all inappropriate!,2,12
phoebe, Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.,2,12
rob," That was great, the kids loved you.",2,12
phoebe," Yay, I rock.",2,12
rob," And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth. You were incredible.",2,12
phoebe, But.,2,12
rob, How did you know there was a but?,2,12
phoebe, I sense these things. It was either but or butter.,2,12
rob," The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kind of hoping' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.",2,12
phoebe, I can do that.,2,12
rob, Really?,2,12
phoebe, Yeah.,2,12
rob, Because that would be fantastic. What? You want to kiss me?,2,12
phoebe, Thinking' about it.,2,12
janitor," Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.",2,12
ross," Buddy, my monkey?",2,12
janitor," Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.",2,12
ross, Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.,2,12
janitor, The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells you?,2,12
ross," That, that is the only thing the zoo's ever told me.",2,12
janitor, Of course they're going to say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?,2,12
ross, That guy Lipson?,2,12
janitor, Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?,2,12
ross," No, I, I only know Lipson.",2,12
janitor," Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...",2,12
ross," Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.",2,12
janitor," Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.",2,12
ross, Of course.,2,12
janitor," Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. that is all I know.",2,12
ross, This is unbelievable.,2,12
janitor," So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?",2,12
ross, Are you trying to get me to bribe you?,2,12
janitor, Maybe.,2,12
ross, But you already told me everything.,2,12
ross," Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.",2,12
rachel," Well, so what're you going to do?",2,12
ross," Well, I guess I'm going to call the beer company and try to find out where he is.",2,12
chandler, that is what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.,2,12
phoebe," OK, hi again.",2,12
all, Hi Phoebe.,2,12

joey," Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?",2,12
erica," OH, and I see you are having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?",2,12

joey," It's not what you think, that was...",2,12
erica, You told me I was the only one.,2,12
joey," Alright look, that is it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Ramoray, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.",2,12
erica, Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?,2,12
joey, Somebody want to help me out here?,2,12
rachel," Oh, I know, I know.",2,12

joey," Well, that was only Because I used the red one to unclog the drain.",2,16
chandler," Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.",2,16
joey," Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?",2,16

rachel," Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?",2,16
ross," No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, having' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?",2,16
monica," Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is going to be here any minute.",2,16

monica," No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.",2,16
ross," I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'",2,16
ross," Alright, shall we?",2,16
monica," OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.",2,16

monica," Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.",2,16
mrs. geller," SOOO, Richard's shopping in the junior section.",2,16
monica, Are we still on that?,2,16
mrs. geller, We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.,2,16
friend," She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.",2,16
joey, Can you believe this place?,2,16
chandler," I know, this is a great apartment.",2,16
joey," Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you are in there it's like you are peeing' with the Rockettes.",2,16

joey," Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?",2,16
joey's co-star, Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.,2,16
chandler," Oh that is all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.",2,16
mr. geller," C'mon, tell us.",2,16
friend," Yeah, is she really 20.",2,16
richard, I am not telling you guys anything.,2,16
mr. geller," C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.",2,16
ross," Dad, you really don't want to do that.",2,16
mr. geller," Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?",2,16
richard," Jack, would you let it go?",2,16
mr. geller," Look, I know what you are going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.",2,16
richard," Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.",2,16
mr. geller," Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .",2,16
ross," Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.",2,16
mr. geller, What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.,2,16
phoebe," OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?",2,16
rachel, Well I. . .,2,16

rachel, Uh-huh.,2,16
phoebe, What? Is it - is this Because of what Ross said?,2,16
rachel," No. Well, yeah, maybe.",2,16
phoebe," I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's going to work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?",2,16
rachel, What's 1922?,2,16
phoebe," Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?",2,16
rachel," Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .",2,16
phoebe," OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?",2,16
rachel, No.,2,16
phoebe," OK, who is the boss of you?!!",2,16
rachel, You?,2,16
phoebe, No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!,2,16

monica, Maybe we should just tell your parents first.,2,16
richard, My parents are dead.,2,16
monica," God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.",2,16

mrs. geller," Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.",2,16
mr. geller," Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.",2,16
mrs. geller, I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?,2,16
mr. geller, I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.,2,16
mrs. geller, I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.,2,16
mr. geller," Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.",2,16
mrs. geller, Really.,2,16
mr. geller," I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.",2,16
mrs. geller," So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?",2,16
mr. geller, Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.,2,16
mrs. geller,Oh Jack stop.,2,16
mr. geller," C'mon, it's my birthday.",2,16
joey, Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.,2,16
chandler," Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.",2,16
joey," Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.",2,16
chandler, Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.,2,16
joey," Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinking' about it.",2,16
chandler, What?,2,16
joey," I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.",2,16
chandler," Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.",2,16
joey," What're you getting' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.",2,16
chandler," Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.",2,16
joey, Well that is how I feel.,2,16
chandler, Well then maybe you should take it.,2,16
joey, Well then maybe I will.,2,16
chandler, Fine with me.,2,16
joey," Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.",2,16
mr. geller, Who's drink can I freshen?,2,16

richard, That - that is an idea.,2,16
monica," Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.",2,16
mrs. geller, Oh?,2,16
richard, Oh?,2,16
ross, Ohh.,2,16
mrs. geller," She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?",2,16
ross," Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?",2,16
mrs. geller," So, who's the mystery man?",2,16
monica," Well, uh, he's a doctor.",2,16

monica," Dad, I'm the twinkie.",2,16
mr. geller, you are the twinkie?,2,16

chandler," No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.",2,18

chandler, We don't need to remedy that.,2,18
phoebe," Oh yeah, it'll be fun.",2,18

And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, you know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, you know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever going to stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?",2,18

joey," Page 42, page 42, page 42.",2,18
phoebe," Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.",2,18
joey," Ooh, I look good.",2,18
phoebe," Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?",2,18
joey," Uh, well, kind of yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not going to live.'",2,18
phoebe," OH, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are going to be kind of mad when they read this?",2,18
joey," Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kind of come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?",2,18
writer," Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.",2,18
joey," I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?",2,18
delivery guy," Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.",2,18
joey," They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.",2,18
delivery guy, Right. Could you sign this?,2,18
joey," No. No way, I'm not signing that.",2,18
delivery guy, I don't think that is going to affect the plot of the show.,2,18
joey, How can they do this to me?,2,18
delivery guy," Er, uh, I'm just going to go. Sorry.",2,18
monica," Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.",2,18
rachel," Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.",2,18
ross, Good night.,2,18
richard, Night Richard. Good luck Mon.,2,18
monica," Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.",2,18
richard, Two.,2,18
monica," Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?",2,18
richard," Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that is two.",2,18
monica," Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm going to go brush my teeth.",2,18
richard," Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. you know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.",2,18
monica," Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.",2,18
rachel," Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.",2,18
ross," Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?",2,18
rachel, Uhhhooo.,2,18

rachel," Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.",2,18
ross," Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.",2,18
rachel," Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.",2,18
ross, Really?,2,18
rachel," Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, you know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, you know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.",2,18
chandler," Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.",2,18
eddie," that is very interesting, you know, Because that is exactly what someone who slept with her would say.",2,18
chandler," This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.",2,18
eddie, Where's Buddy?,2,18
chandler, Buddy?,2,18
eddie," My fish, Buddy.",2,18
chandler, There was no fish when she dropped it off.,2,18
eddie," Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my intelligence by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?",2,18
chandler, Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie.. Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just going to take this guy right off you and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?,2,18
richard, that is it? that is the giant number you were afraid to tell me?,2,18
monica, Well yeah.,2,18
richard," Well, that is not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinking it was like a fleet.",2,18
monica, You really ok with it?,2,18
richard," Oh honey, I'm fine.",2,18
monica," Oh, yay. Ok about that two.",2,18
richard," What? Alright, what about my two?",2,18
monica," Well, it just seems like a really small number.",2,18
richard," Right, and...",2,18
monica," And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you are doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?",2,18
richard," Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.",2,18
monica, But you've only slept with two people.,2,18
richard, Right.,2,18
monica," Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.",2,18
richard, Now I do.,2,18
rachel," Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you are loving, you make me laugh.",2,18
ross," Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.",2,18
rachel," God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...",2,18
ross," Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you are saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?",2,18
rachel," Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not going to lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.",2,18
ross, Knock-knock.,2,18
rachel," But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. you know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.",2,18
ross, Until now.,2,18
rachel," Oh, hi.",2,18
monica, Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.,2,18
rachel," Oh my God, honey that is great.",2,18

rachel, Yeesss.,2,18
monica," Fine, go have sex.",2,18
richard," No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.",2,18
ross," No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...",2,18
rachel, Honey.,2,18
ross," What, what oh....",2,18
richard, Shall we?,2,18
monica," It's not going to happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.",2,18
richard," Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...",2,18
chandler," So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.",2,18
monica, Why?,2,18
chandler, Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.,2,18
phoebe, Why would you kill his fish?,2,18
chandler," Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.",2,18
rachel," Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?",2,18

rachel," Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.",2,18
joey," Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or something.",2,18
phoebe," But Joey, you are going to be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.",2,18
joey," Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.",2,18
phoebe," Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.",2,18
monica," Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that is nice.",2,18
chandler, It's going to be ok. You know that?,2,18
joey," No, I don't. It's like, you know, you work your whole life for something' and you think that when you get it it's never going to be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. you know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.",2,18
chandler, I'm sorry man.,2,18
rachel," Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.",2,18

eddie," I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.",2,18
chandler,"Well that is not an, even a real fish. No, that is a goldfish cracker.",2,18

What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?",2,19

monica," Oh my God, it was incredible.",2,19
phoebe, Didn't it like totally speak to you?,2,19
rachel," Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?",2,19

phoebe," Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.",2,19
rachel, Men just take out wind?,2,19
phoebe," you-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.",2,19
rachel, Wow.,2,19
phoebe, Yeah.,2,19
rachel," Well that sounds kind of cool, kind of like The Hobbit.",2,19
monica," It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.",2,19
phoebe," Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.",2,19
monica, No.,2,19
phoebe," No, Because he's yummy.",2,19
monica, Yes. But all the other ones.,2,19
phoebe," Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.",2,19
joey, Anybody want a croan.,2,19
phoebe," Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'",2,19
estelle, Don't worry about it already. Things happen.,2,19
joey," So, you are not mad at me for getting fired and everything?",2,19
estelle," Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?",2,19
joey," No, can we get back to me?",2,19
estelle," Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.",2,19
joey, Alright. Cab driver number two?,2,19
estelle, you are welcome.,2,19
joey, But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray. How can I go from being' a neurosurgeon to driving' a cab?,2,19
estelle," Things change, roll with them.",2,19
joey," But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not going to do this.",2,19
estelle," Joey, I'm going to tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.",2,19
joey, I'm sorry. See you.,2,19
rachel," Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.",2,19
monica, Isn't it.,2,19
rachel," Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.",2,19
phoebe, I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.,2,19
ross, Hey you guys.,2,19

ross," Uh, sweetie we've got to go.",2,19
rachel, NO!,2,19
ross, No?,2,19
rachel," No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?",2,19
ross, Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.,2,19
rachel," No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.",2,19
monica, You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?,2,19
ross," Excuse me, your, your, your wind?",2,19
rachel," Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?",2,19
ross," You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.",2,19
rachel," Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.",2,19
phoebe," Um-um, um-um.",2,19
rachel," you are right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!",2,19
joey, What is it?,2,19
ross," I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.",2,19
joey," See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.",2,19
ross," What, what's that?",2,19
joey, It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.,2,19
ross," Open it, open in.",2,19
joey, Oh my God.,2,19
ross, Woah.,2,19
joey," Look at this, how did I spend so much money?",2,19

joey, Ahh.,2,19
ross," What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?",2,19
joey," My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm going to do.",2,19
ross, Well I guess you can start by driving a cab on Another World.,2,19
joey, What?,2,19
ross, That audition.,2,19
joey, that is a two line part.,2,19
ross," Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.",2,19
joey, So what.,2,19
ross," So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.",2,19
joey," Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.",2,19
ross, Toilet paper?,2,19
joey, Yeah.,2,19
ross," Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.",2,19
joey," Well knock it off, you are supposed to be my friend.",2,19
ross, I am your friend.,2,19
joey," Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Something' big's gonna come along, I know it.'",2,19
ross, But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.,2,19
joey," Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.",2,19
ross," Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's going to be till you get another.",2,19
joey," Look, I don't want to hear this right now.",2,19
ross," Huh, I'm just saying...",2,19
joey, Well don't just say.,2,19
ross," you know, maybe, maybe I should just go.",2,19
joey, Ok.,2,19
ross," Ok. I'll see you later. Just think about it, ok.",2,19
joey," I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Ramoray. That was huge. Big things are going to happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?",2,19
eddie, Hey pal.,2,19
chandler, Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?,2,19

chandler," Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?",2,19
eddie," Oh yeah, that is right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.",2,19
chandler," Maybe Because the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you are supposed to be doing right now?",2,19
eddie," Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!",2,19
chandler, Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...,2,19
eddie," Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?",2,19
chandler, Your last roommate's kidney?,2,19
eddie, that is a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.,2,19
joey," Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.",2,19
gunther, Lemonade? You ok man?,2,19
joey," Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.",2,19
gunther," Oh, that is too bad. How'd they do it?",2,19

rachel, Then what's going to happen?,2,20
ross," Well, we won't want to raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.",2,20
rachel, Uh-huh.,2,20
ross," Yeah, that way I figure, you know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.",2,20
rachel," Wow. Wow, that is great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.",2,20
ross, Huh?,2,20

richard, Charlotte who?,2,20
phoebe," With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like you know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.",2,20
monica," Alright, you want to feel better?",2,20
phoebe, Yeah.,2,20
monica," Ok, here, watch this.",2,20
phoebe, It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.,2,20
monica," So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfulness is baked right in.",2,20
phoebe," Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was going to see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.",2,20
richard," Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kind of see it coming?",2,20

monica," Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.",2,20
richard," Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shovelling snow?'",2,20
monica," Alright that is great, then just go. Go Knicks.",2,20
richard," Uh, it's the college playoffs.",2,20
monica," Oh, then go Vassar.",2,20
richard," Uh, they're not in it.",2,20
monica," Ok, then just go.",2,20
richard, Ok.,2,20
monica," Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't want to be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they want to spend 24 hours a day with them.",2,20
phoebe, Sure.,2,20
monica," It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, you know, and I don't know, what do I do?",2,20
phoebe, Does it matter? you are ultimately just going to die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.,2,20
rachel,Aghh.,2,20
phoebe, Me too.,2,20
monica, I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.,2,20
rachel," Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.",2,20
monica," you know what, I think I'm going to go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Christmas candles.",2,20
ross,"Ok, what the hell happened back there?",2,20
rachel," I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.",2,20
ross," Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. you know, I mean, you are at work, you are assembling bones, your mind wanders.",2,20
rachel," Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.",2,20
ross," C'mon, what, you never think about our future?",2,20
rachel," Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're going to sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're going to have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our children's' names are going to be. You know what our children's names are going to be.",2,20
ross," No, no, I mean, you know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.",2,20
rachel, What was the book?,2,20
ross, The big book of children's' names.,2,20
rachel," Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.",2,20
ross, Yeah.,2,20
rachel," But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are going to have to deal with that.",2,20
ross, Ok fine.,2,20
rachel, Thank you.,2,20
ross, We're not done.,2,20
rachel, I didn't know that.,2,20
ross," Ok, then you are going to have to understand that you are with a guy who's not going to stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're going to end up together and if that scares you, tough, Because you are going to have to deal with that.",2,20
rachel," Fine, I will.",2,20
ross," Good, Because I love you.",2,20
rachel, Oh yeah.,2,20

monica," Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?",2,20
phoebe," I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.""",2,20
chandler, Kick save and... denied.,2,20
richard," But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?",2,20

richard," What're you talking' about, I was killing' them.",2,20
monica," Yeah, well they suck too.",2,20
ross," Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.",2,20
rachel," Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.",2,20
ross,Hello.,2,20

phoebe,"Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough going' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.",2,20
ernie," Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.",2,20
phoebe," Oh, I'm so glad you are here.",2,20

everyone, Ahh.,2,21
phoebe, And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.,2,21
monica, His Indian name?,2,21

ross," Because it's a special hat. See he bought it Because he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, you know. Now Chandler...",2,21
chandler," Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. you are actually stealing my hat?",2,21

joey," Hey pheebs, I think you are good to go.",2,21
phoebe," Yeah, I don't know.",2,21
rachel, What's the matter?,2,21
phoebe," I just think that this was a really bad sign, you know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, you know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not going to be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb.

monica," Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?",2,21
joey," Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.",2,21
rachel, How did you make $17.,2,21
monica," Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.",2,21
joey, How come those?,2,21
monica," Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY because I think it sounds sexy.",2,21

rachel," Ok, so Phoebe, now are you going to call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?",2,21
phoebe," I, I don't want to meet my father over the phone. What am I going to say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'",2,21
joey," Hey Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.",2,21
phoebe," Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.",2,21
monica, DON'T...be too long with the phone.,2,21
rachel, She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.,2,21
joey,It's a woman.,2,21
phoebe, So talk to her.,2,21
joey,"Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.",2,21
rachel, Why the voice.,2,21
joey,Hard to say.,2,21
chandler, Your cappuccino sir.,2,21
ross, Thank you.,2,21
chandler, you know I think this is much better than the coffee house.,2,21
ross, Absolutely.,2,21
ross, How come it's not mixing with the water?,2,21
chandler,"Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.",2,21
joey,"Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my niece's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.",2,21
chandler, Ok.,2,21
ross, No.,2,21
chandler, No?,2,21
ross," No. Man I don't want to have to have Joey with me every time I want to descent cup of coffee. you know, and I don't want to spend the rest of my life drinking cappuccino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.",2,21
chandler," Alright, hang on a second there Custer.",2,21
joey," Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?",2,21
ross," Yeah, sure.",2,21
joey, By someone besides Monica?,2,21
ross," No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that is just something every man has to go through once in his life. you know, like a, like a right of passage or something'.",2,21
chandler," Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? you know, because I think actually mine's growing back.",2,21
monica,I need to borrow a hundred bucks.,2,21
rachel, What?,2,21
monica," Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.",2,21

mrs buffay," What are these, stitches?",2,21
phoebe," Yeah, eight of them. that is 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long Because that cone'll fill up really really fast.",2,21

phoebe, Oh.,2,21
frank, Except stilts.,2,21
phoebe, Stilts?,2,21
frank," Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving Because he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.",2,21
phoebe, Wow.,2,21
frank, Yeah.,2,21

phoebe, Yeah.,2,21
frank," This is huge, you can buy me beer.",2,21
phoebe," I'm not going to. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'",2,21
frank, I got to friend named Mark.,2,21
phoebe, That'll work too.,2,21
frank," Cool, alright. So maybe, you know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or something'.",2,21
phoebe," Yeah, that'd be ok.",2,21
frank, Alright.,2,21

chandler," Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?",2,21
ross, what do you mean?,2,21
chandler," Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.",2,21
big bully," No, you can't use your watch.",2,21
chandler, Ok.,2,21

phoebe, Hey nice boobs.,2,21
chandler," Guys guys, check this out.",2,21
joey, Excellent.,2,21
monica," So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.",2,22
all, oh.,2,22
monica, What?,2,22
ross, Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?,2,22
monica, You want to be in charge of the food committee?,2,22
ross, Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?,2,22
joey, Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?,2,22
ross, Yeah.,2,22
phoebe," Yeah, I agree. you know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you are fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.",2,22
monica," Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.",2,22
monica," Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.",2,22
chandler," Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.",2,22
ross," I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.",2,22
monica," Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.",2,22
joey," Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.",2,22
phoebe, Why not her?,2,22
joey," Cause she uh, she steals stuff.",2,22
chandler, Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.,2,22
monica, Joey that is horrible.,2,22
joey," Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.",2,22
phoebe," I'm sorry, I didn't know.",2,22
joey," I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.",2,22
ross," Hi honey, how did it go?",2,22
rachel," Agh, it was the graduation from hell.",2,22
chandler," you know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.",2,22
rachel," you know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.",2,22
monica, So what happened?,2,22
rachel," My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.",2,22
phoebe," Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.",2,22
monica," Well, how bout just her mom?",2,22
chandler, Why her mom?,2,22
monica, Cause I already invited her.,2,22
phoebe," Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?",2,22
joey," Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.",2,22
phoebe," Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?",2,22
monica," Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.",2,22
chandler, Excuse me?,2,22
monica, It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.,2,22
joey," Oh that is nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.",2,22
monica,Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?,2,22
mr. greene, What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?,2,22
monica," No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.",2,22
mr. greene," oh, you are having a parteee.",2,22
monica," No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.",2,22
mr. greene," I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?",2,22
chandler," This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?",2,22
mrs. greene, Hi Monica.,2,22
monica, Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.,2,22
chandler," So, basically just a Chinese guy.",2,22
joey," Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.",2,22
mr. greene," Alright, that sounds like a two person job.",2,22
mrs. greene," Well, my goodness, what was that?",2,22
monica," Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.",2,22
mrs. greene, You thought I was Rachel?,2,22
chandler," Yes because uh, you look so young.",2,22
phoebe," And because you are both, you know, white women.",2,22
mrs. greene," Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?",2,22
chandler," NO! No, I'll take that for you.",2,22
mrs. greene," Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons...  The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was…",2,22
phoebe,"Ha-ha, that is great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, you know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, you know, like at a restaurant. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.",2,22
monica," Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.",2,22
chandler," Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?",2,22
joey,"Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.",2,22
monica," So uh, Joey and Chandler, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.",2,22
chandler," Uhh, yes, absolutely, um. Why again?",2,22
monica, Because that is where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.,2,22
joey, Right this is staging.,2,22
chandler," Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.",2,22
joey,This is clearly in the wrong apartment.,2,22
chandler," Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two. Alright fellas, let's keep it moving', let' keep it moving.",2,22
monica, Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that is Ross.,2,22

rachel," Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.",2,22
mrs. greene, Happy birthday sweetie.,2,22
rachel," Wow you, you. I had no idea.",2,22

rachel, I do.,2,22
ross, that is who.,2,22

joey, Quick volleyball question.,2,22
chandler, Volleyball.,2,22
joey," Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?",2,22

rachel, You want me to see a therapist?,2,22
mrs. greene," Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.",2,22
rachel," Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I got to go, I got to go do a thing.",2,22
mr. greene, Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bonsai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.,2,22

chandler,"Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holding' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.",2,22
rachel," This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is going to be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's going to decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?",2,22
chandler," Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.",2,22
rachel," you know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.",2,22
chandler, Because it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?,2,22
rachel," It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset because nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occurred to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...",2,22
chandler," I, I know.",2,22
monica," Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.",2,22

chandler," Sorry, we're on a major flan high.",2,22

monica," Ok, that is enough.",2,22
phoebe," Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.",2,22
rachel," Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.",2,22

joey," Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?",2,23

chandler, Had it.,2,23
phoebe," Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!",2,23
monica," Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.",2,23
richard," Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.",2,23
richard," Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?",2,23
monica, Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.,2,23
richard, What're you doing?,2,23

monica," I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.",2,23
richard," Then, you are redoing it because...",2,23
monica," If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.",2,23
richard, you are pretty much running that risk either way.,2,23
monica," Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.",2,23
richard," Oh, well that is not so crazy.",2,23
monica, I'm just easing you in.,2,23
richard," Oh, alright.",2,23
monica," Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.",2,23

monica," Really? Wow, well then come on, I want to show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.",2,23
chandler," Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.",2,23
joey, But don't you need experience for a job like that?,2,23
chandler," It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you are doing, hey, you are an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you are a processor.",2,23
scott,"Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.",2,23

monica, It's going to be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just going to be so glad that you don't have barnacles on your butt.,2,23
phoebe, Come in.,2,23
ryan," Hey baby, I'm back…",2,23
phoebe," Hey Ryan, what's up?",2,23
ryan, What's going' on?,2,23
phoebe," Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.",2,23
ryan, Chicken or small?,2,23
phoebe, Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.,2,23
ryan, Why aren't you at home in bed?,2,23
phoebe,"Because my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, Because oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.",2,23
ryan," I'm sorry, I never had them.",2,23
phoebe," OH, ohh.",2,23
ryan," If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.",2,23
phoebe," Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.",2,23
ryan, Can I please see your face?,2,23
phoebe, Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.,2,23
ryan," Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.",2,23
phoebe," And you hate fish. Oh. that is so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me… Oh, I am scary.",2,23
ryan," Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.",2,23
phoebe," I hate this. Because I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.",2,23
ryan," Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not going to let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.",2,23
phoebe," Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.",2,23
joey, Hey.,2,23
chandler," Hey, how's the first day going'?",2,23
joey, Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.,2,23
chandler, Well there you go.,2,23
joey," Hey and everybody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.",2,23
chandler," Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?",2,23
joey," Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?",2,23
chandler, Weird world. Your kids?,2,23
joey, I figure my character has kids.,2,23
chandler, you know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.,2,23
joey," Well, see when you are acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.",2,23
chandler," Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.",2,23
joey," Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... you know what? Just did.",2,23
chandler, Really? Wow. that is some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.,2,23
ryan, You know what makes the itching even worse?,2,23
phoebe, That you don't stop talking about it.,2,23
ryan, Fine.,2,23
phoebe," Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...",2,23
ryan, What're you doing? Are you scratching?,2,23
phoebe," No. This is what I do for luck, ok.",2,23
ryan, you are scratching. Give me the dice.,2,23
phoebe, No.,2,23
ryan, Give me the dice.,2,23
phoebe," No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.",2,23
ryan," We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.",2,23
phoebe," Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just want to grab all these houses and rub them all over my body.",2,23
ryan, No.,2,23
phoebe, Give it.,2,23
ryan, No.,2,23
phoebe," Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.",2,23
ryan, Oh God help me.,2,23
phoebe," Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.",2,23
rachel," Oh, stop that, stop that right now.",2,23
ross," You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you are a military man.",2,23
joey," You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen will pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.",2,23
jeannie," Oh, that sounds lovely. We're going to have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.",2,23
joey," Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.",2,23
jeannie, Bye bye Joey.,2,23
joey, What a phony.,2,23
chandler," Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.",2,23
joey, Sir.,2,23
mr. douglas," Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not going to receive the systems report until next Friday?",2,23
chandler, Well the people in my group want to spend the holiday weekend with their families.,2,23
mr. douglas," I have a family, I'm going to be here.",2,23
joey," Yeah Bing, what's that about?",2,23
chandler," It's about cutting my people a little slack, you know, for morale. Look, if you want to see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.",2,23
mr. douglas, Rough numbers?,2,23
joey, This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.,2,23
mr. douglas, Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.,2,23
chandler," Uh, if you say so sir.",2,23
joey," Joseph's good, isn't he?",2,23
chandler," Well, I'm going to kill you.",2,23
joey," Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kind of guy that likes to mix it up. you know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.",2,23
chandler, Why?,2,23
joey," Look, I'm sorry but that is what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull something', he'll call you on it. 'What're you trying' to pull,' he'll say.",2,23
richard," Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?",2,23
monica, This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.,2,23
richard, you are strict.,2,23
monica, It's for their own good.,2,23
richard," You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.",2,23
monica," Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?",2,23
richard," If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.",2,23
monica, Very good.,2,23
richard, Thank you.,2,23
monica, You know what. Tomorrow I'm going to do your clocks.,2,23
richard, you are going to do what to my clocks.,2,23
monica, I'm going to set them to my time.,2,23
richard," Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.",2,23
monica," No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You want to know why?",2,23
richard, Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.,2,23
monica," No forget it, I'm not going to tell you now.",2,23
richard, No come on. Come on tell me.,2,23
monica, No. See you don't understand.,2,23
richard, Come on.,2,23
monica, No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.,2,23
richard, No that is not true. That is not true.,2,23
monica, Oh yeah.,2,23
richard, Yeah.,2,23
monica," Alright, well tell me one of yours.",2,23
richard," Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.",2,23
monica, What if they get mixed up?,2,23
richard," Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.",2,23
monica," You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you are too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.",2,23
richard," See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.",2,23
joey, Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.,2,23
chandler, Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?,2,23
joey,Because he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.,2,23
chandler," What- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?",2,23
joey," Because at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.",2,23
chandler," Alright, that is it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for you, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that is not possible so I'm going to have to let both of you go.",2,23
joey," What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.",2,23
chandler," I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.",2,23
joey," Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, Because he's not in your department.",2,23
chandler," Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.",2,23
joey, Karen.,2,23
chandler," Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.",2,23
joey, Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.,2,23
chandler," Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.",2,23
joey, Really?,2,23
chandler," No freakshow, she's fictional.",2,23
joey," Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.",2,23
chandler, Thank you.,2,23
joey," It's just that, I, I'm going to miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.",2,23
phoebe, Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.,2,23
rachel," No sorry hon, Monica's orders.",2,23
ryan,Well that wasn't easy.,2,23
ross," Ok, dinner's on.",2,23
rachel, And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's going to be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.,2,23
ross," Alright you kids, bye now.",2,23
phoebe and ryan, Bye.,2,23
ross," Oh look, a low budget puppet show.",2,23
phoebe, It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.,2,23

monica, Yeah?,2,23
richard," Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.",2,23
monica, No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.,2,23
richard, Or so I would have you believe.,2,23
monica," No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.",2,23
richard," Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.",2,23
monica," Alright, go on.",2,23
richard," Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.",2,23
monica," Oh my God, you are a freak.",2,23
richard, Yeah. How 'bout that.,2,23
rachel," So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?",2,23
ryan, I really can't say.,2,23
ross, So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?,2,23

ross, You like that do you?,2,23
rachel, Oh yeah.,2,23
ross, I'll make some calls.,2,23
rachel, Ok.,2,23
ryan, Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?,2,23
phoebe," I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and you know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.",2,23

ross," Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.",2,23
rachel," Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?",2,24
joey, Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.,2,24
all, Who?,2,24
joey, All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.,2,24
all, Wow!,2,24
joey," Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind of a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.",2,24
chandler,Because he was just so darn cute.,2,24
joey," No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.",2,24
ross," Well, hey. you are an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.",2,24
joey," I did do it, I'm a professional.",2,24
monica, Then what's the problem?,2,24
joey," See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that is like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.",2,24
phoebe," Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing. Ooh.",2,24
chandler," Hey, what did your agent say?",2,24
joey," Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I got to figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.",2,24
monica," What, forget it!",2,24
rachel," Yeah, right.",2,24
joey," Come on, I need your help here.",2,24
phoebe," All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.",2,24
joey," You see this, this is a friend.",2,24
phoebe," Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.",2,24
joey, Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?,2,24
monica," Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that is what you need to work on.",2,24
joey," Yeah, that makes sense.",2,24
ross, Over my dead body!,2,24
chandler, And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.,2,24
ross,"Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.",2,24
phoebe,"Oh my God, you look so good!",2,24
rachel, I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.,2,24
ross," So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.",2,24
rachel, Because I promised Mindy I would.,2,24
monica," Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.",2,24
rachel," Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.",2,24

rachel, Wow! What's that like?,2,24
chandler," It's like this, me, no jokes.",2,24
phoebe," All right, stop it, you are freaking me out.",2,24
richard," Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.",2,24
all," Bye, Richard.",2,24
monica," Bye sweetie, I love you.",2,24

monica, What are you talking about? What wedding?,2,24
phoebe," Come on, like you never talk that.",2,24
monica," Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'",2,24
rachel, Afraid to ask him?,2,24
monica, Could not be more terrified.,2,24
chandler," Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.",2,24
monica,"Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.",2,24
richard," Awww! You know that is probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.",2,24
monica," Hey, you know I got a question for you. Just a little thing, no pressure.",2,24
richard, Okay.,2,24
monica," Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?",2,24
richard, Sure I do.,2,24
monica," Yeah, am I in it?",2,24

monica," Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.",2,24
richard," Oh, yeah!",2,24

richard," Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.",2,24
monica," Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?",2,24
richard, Like a hound?,2,24
monica," Not a basset, a bassinet.",2,24
richard, You really need the bassinet?,2,24
monica," Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.",2,24
richard," Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.",2,24
monica, Uh-huh.,2,24
richard," Look I want you, now.",2,24
monica," that is Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talking' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.",2,24
joey," Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.",2,24

chandler,It means we're holding hands.,2,24
phoebe, Are you the cutest?,2,24
chandler, I'm afraid I might just be.,2,24
phoebe," You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.",2,24
chandler," Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.",2,24
phoebe, It could be like a big giant guy.,2,24
joey,"Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?",2,24
phoebe, We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.,2,24
joey," Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's going to live. Women live longer than men.",2,24
chandler, How do you not fall down more?,2,24
phoebe," Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'",2,24
chandler," All right. ""My husband is sleeping with his secretary."" She's married!",2,24
phoebe, Well at least we know she's a woman.,2,24
chandler, I can't believe she's married.,2,24
joey," Aw, man I'm sorry. This must be very tough for you, huh.",2,24
monica," So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you are not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.",2,24
richard," Oh, that is why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.",2,24
monica," Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.",2,24
richard, Neither am I.,2,24
ross," Hey, there.",2,24
rachel, Hi.,2,24
ross, Are you all right?,2,24
rachel," Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.",2,24
ross," Sweetie, it's be going to okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.",2,24

ross," I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'",2,24
rachel," Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.",2,24
ross," Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.",2,24
rachel," Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.",2,24

joey,"Look, what do you want me to say?",3,1
chandler,I want you to say that you like her!,3,1

ross,"Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.",3,1
rachel,"Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.",3,1

rachel,Were both of those Joey?,3,1
ross,"Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.",3,1
rachel,Not even with your best friend.,3,1
ross,No!,3,1

monica,Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?,3,1
phoebe,"All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....",3,1
monica,"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",3,1
phoebe,"All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....",3,1
monica,"Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.",3,1

joey,"Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.",3,1
monica,"So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.",3,1
phoebe,"Monica, do you want us to take you home?",3,1
monica,"Uh, huh.  Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.",3,1

ross,"With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!",3,1
chandler,"I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get out of here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kind of like, you are, you know. You know....

joey,"What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.",3,2
chandler,"The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that is my seat.",3,2
joey,"Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...",3,2
ross,"You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..",3,2

rachel,What?!,3,2
ross,Never mind.,3,2
richard,,3,2
monica,Is-is-is that message old or new?  Old or new?! Old or new?!,3,2
ross,"It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?",3,2
monica,"What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?",3,2
chandler,"Honey, you did call him back. Because, it's, it's really old.",3,2

ross,"No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't!  What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!",3,2
phoebe,"Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.",3,2
monica,"If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?",3,2
phoebe,"Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.",3,2
chandler,Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.,3,2
monica,"So, should I call him back?",3,2
the guys,,3,2
chandler,"All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair.  I'm so, comfortable.",3,2
joey,"Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.",3,2
chandler,All right!,3,2
ross,"Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.",3,2
chandler,"All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!",3,2
rachel,"Is this a little too...  Pheebs, what happened?",3,2
phoebe,Hummus. I got the hummus.,3,2

rachel,"No, you are right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.",3,2
ross,"No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.",3,2
rachel,"Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?",3,2
monica,I called him.,3,2
all,,3,2
monica,"Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?",3,2
phoebe,"Well, how could it not be breezy, no, Because, you are, you are in such a breezy place.",3,2
monica,"Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.",3,2
joey,"Monica, how are you going to do that?",3,2
monica,I know the code to his answering machine.,3,2
ross,"Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you are dialling, you are dialling.",3,2
richard,,3,2
machine,"""You have two new messages.""",3,2
joey,"Wow, what a cool job.  'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'",3,2
monica,"""Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in Because I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checking'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy.""",3,2
joey,"Hey, you can't say you are breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.",3,2
woman's voice,,3,2
joey,Now she sounded breezy.,3,2
monica,He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.,3,2
phoebe,"Monica, you don't know that.",3,2
monica,"Well, who's voice was that?",3,2
chandler,"Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.",3,2
monica,"Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?",3,2
ross,"Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.",3,2
monica,It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.,3,2
rachel,"Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!",3,2
ross,"You don't, you don't know what your wearing?",3,2
rachel,"Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.",3,2
ross,"Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.",3,2
chandler,"All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, ""Get out of my chair, dillhole!""",3,2
joey,Okay.,3,2
chandler,What are you doing?,3,2
joey,"You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.",3,2
chandler,The cushions are the essence of the chair!,3,2
joey,that is right! I'm taking the essence.,3,2
chandler,"Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.",3,2
ross,"Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.",3,2
rachel,"Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.",3,2
ross,"Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.",3,2
rachel,"Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.",3,2
phoebe,"Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!",3,2
rachel,"Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.",3,2
phoebe,"Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!",3,2
ross,"Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?",3,2
rachel,"No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.",3,2
chandler,We used them as pillows when we went camping.,3,2
ross,What?,3,2
chandler,The sheep.,3,2
ross,"Hey, what you do on your own time...",3,2
joey,Where's my underwear?!,3,2
ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?",3,2
chandler,He took my essence!,3,2
ross,"Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you are wearing now?",3,2
joey,"Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.",3,2
ross,"Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?",3,2
joey,It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not going to go commando in another man's fatigues.,3,2
chandler,"Well, then it looks like somebody is going to have to give back somebody his cushions.",3,2
joey,"Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm going to do the exact opposite to you.",3,2
chandler,"What are you, what are you going to show me my clothes?",3,2
joey,"Hey, opposite, is opposite!",3,2
chandler,He's got nothing!,3,2
phoebe,"Okay, I'm ready.",3,2
phoebe,"Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'",3,2
chandler,What are you supporting?,3,2
phoebe,Duh!! Christmas!,3,2
ross,"Okay, hey, that is okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch.  Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more.  What time is it? It's 7",3,2
rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?",3,2
ross,"Just, just, just pick one!",3,2
phoebe,"Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?",3,2
rachel,"Yeah, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?",3,2
ross,"Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you are trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.",3,2
rachel,But I...,3,2
ross,"No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.",3,2
rachel,All right.,3,2
ross,Thank you!,3,2
monica,"Okay. I got to call Michelle. I got to see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.",3,2
ross,"It was, it was her voice.",3,2
chandler,"Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.",3,2
michelle,,3,2
monica,Okay. That was her right?,3,2
phoebe,Definitely.,3,2
monica,"See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.",3,2
ross,Yay!,3,2
phoebe,"I'll get it, okay.  Hi, Monica and Rachel's.  Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling.  Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.",3,2
monica,"Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialled your number by mistake.  Oh, you are so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....",3,2
chandler,"You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?",3,2
monica,"Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that is allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you are not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!!  That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.",3,2
ross,"No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.",3,2
monica,"Okay, fine.",3,2
chandler,"They got a phone in there, right?",3,2
phoebe,"Okay, we're on it. We're on it.",3,2
ross,"Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.",3,2
rachel,I'm not going to go.,3,2
ross,you are not going to go.,3,2
rachel,"No, I think I'm going to catch up on my correspondence.",3,2
ross,"How, how, um how can you not be going?",3,2
rachel,"I'm not going to go, so I think that will accomplish the not going.",3,2
ross,"Um, you know, just out of curiosity...",3,2
rachel,"Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.",3,2
ross,"Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.",3,2
rachel,It's fine.,3,2
ross,"No, but, your-your mad.",3,2
rachel,I'm not mad.,3,2
ross,No.,3,2
rachel,I'm just not going.,3,2
ross,Your not going.,3,2
rachel,Right.,3,2
ross,Okay. You know that I-I have to go.,3,2
rachel,"Um, hum.",3,2
ross,Right. So is it going to be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.',3,2
rachel,No.,3,2
ross,"No, because your not upset.",3,2
rachel,Right.,3,2
ross,About the yelling.,3,2
rachel,"Right, and the humiliating.",3,2
ross,"Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.",3,2
rachel,"Um, hum.",3,2
ross,We're good.,3,2
rachel,Right.,3,2
ross,Okay. Honey?,3,2
rachel,"Yes, Ross.",3,2
ross,I love you.,3,2
phoebe,Get away from that! No!  She's just getting dressed.,3,2
chandler,Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?,3,2
joey,"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.",3,2
chandler,Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!,3,2
joey,Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...,3,2
chandler,Oooo-ooh!,3,2
joey,"Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.",3,2
ross,"Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!",3,2
chandler,"Jeez, what a baby.",3,2
joey,"Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.",3,2
ross,"You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even going to go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.",3,2
joey,You could drink the fat.,3,2
ross,"Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.",3,2
rachel,"No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.",3,2
ross,What?,3,2
rachel,I think you should drink the fat.,3,2
joey,Yay!,3,2
ross,"Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that is what I'll do.",3,2
phoebe,"Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. that is been sitting out.",3,2
ross,"I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.",3,2
rachel,"No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!",3,2
ross,You will?!,3,2
rachel,"You were really going to do that, weren't you?",3,2
ross,"Well, yeah.",3,2
rachel,You were going to drink the fat.,3,2
joey,Let's see what else he'll do!,3,2
ross,"How 'bout instead you, go get changed!  You, give him back his underwear! I'm going to go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!",3,2
chandler,Stop it. Stop it!,3,2
phoebe,"Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!",3,2
richard,,3,2
machine,You have three new messages.,3,2
monica,Not any more!,3,2
machine,Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.,3,2
monica,"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.",3,2
machine,Your outgoing message has now been changed.,3,2
monica,"Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!",3,2
monica,"""Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know."" Nooo!!",3,2
phoebe,How did you do that?,3,2
monica,I don't know!,3,2
machine,Good-bye.,3,2
monica,No!!!!,3,2
ross,"Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!",3,2
monica,Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.,3,2
phoebe,"Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.",3,2
ross,"Rachel!!  Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!",3,2
rachel,"And I still have about five seconds to spare.  Okay, that was about seven seconds.",3,2
ross,So we're a little late.,3,2
rachel,"Come on.  Oh! And, uh, by the way....",3,2
ross,What?,3,2
rachel,"I'm going commando, too.",3,2
ross,Aww!!!,3,2
sherman whitfield,"Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.",3,2
ross,Wow! What a pleasure.,3,2
whitfield,"Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.",3,2
chandler,Excuse me. Hi.,3,2
whitfield,Yes?,3,2
chandler,"Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.",3,2

chandler,"I mean, I was sitting there.",3,2
whitfield,"But, you got up!",3,2
chandler,"But, I never left the room!",3,2
whitfield,"But, you left the chair area.",3,2
chandler,"All right, that is it, give me your underwear.",3,2
joey,WHOAA!!,3,3
chandler,"See Joe, that is why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.",3,3
monica,"Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.",3,3
ross,Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?,3,3
monica,Went down to the docks. Bet you didn't know you could get it wholesale.,3,3
rachel,I didn't know there were docks.,3,3
joey,Hey.,3,3
chandler,Hey.,3,3
ross,"Aww, is it broken?",3,3
joey,"No, I got to wear this thing for a couple weeks.",3,3
rachel,Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?,3,3
joey,Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.,3,3
chandler,"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was going to buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.",3,3
joey,What is this? Fruit?,3,3
rachel,Monica's making jam.,3,3
joey,"Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?",3,3
chandler,Because the kids need new shoes.,3,3
monica,"I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam.  Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.",3,3
joey,This will just be my batch.,3,3
phoebe,"Um, that is it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.",3,3
guy,"You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....",3,3
phoebe,What?,3,3
guy,"One more chance Ursula, please?",3,3
phoebe,"Ooh. Oh, well this is awkward.",3,3
guy,Wh..,3,3
phoebe,"Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.",3,3
guy,"Oh, that is great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!",3,3
phoebe,"Oh, you are not a dingus.",3,3
guy,"I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.",3,3
phoebe,"Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.",3,3
guy,Well thanks.,3,3
phoebe,"Wait,  you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counsellor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you are not a witch you are just an average student.' See what I'm saying?",3,3
guy,Not really.,3,3
phoebe,"Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.",3,3
guy,"Wait. you are right. I know you are right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here",3,3
phoebe,"Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?",3,3
guy,"Yeah, okay.",3,3
phoebe,"Okay.  Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.",3,3
guy,Sorry.,3,3
rachel,Mon?,3,3
ross,Mon?,3,3
rachel,'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.',3,3
ross,"Wait a minute, look.",3,3
rachel,What?,3,3
ross,"Look, look, look.",3,3
rachel,"What, what, what?",3,3
ross,It's an empty apartment.,3,3
rachel,Ooh.,3,3
ross,We're all alone in an empty apartment.,3,3
rachel,"Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes  Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.",3,3
ross,There it is.,3,3
rachel,"Oh, oh, that is what you are talking about.  Hey.",3,3
ross,Hey.,3,3
chandler,Do I look fat?,3,3
ross and rachel,No.,3,3
chandler,"Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.",3,3
rachel,"Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.",3,3
chandler,"Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....",3,3
ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? No! Does size matter?",3,3
rachel,Nooo!,3,3
ross,And it works both ways.,3,3
chandler,"Okay, so you both just know this stuff?",3,3
rachel,"Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kind of catch on.",3,3
ross,"Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?",3,3
chandler,"that is easy, baggage claim.",3,3
ross,"Wrong! Now you are single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.",3,3
chandler,"Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.",3,3
rachel,"Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, Because we're cuddlily sleepers.  Okay, I'm late for work.",3,3
ross,Oh.,3,3
rachel,All right are you guys going to come down?,3,3
ross,"Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.",3,3
rachel,Good luck Chandler.,3,3
chandler,Thank you Rachel.,3,3
ross,Bye sweetie.,3,3
rachel,Bye hon.,3,3
ross,"Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.",3,3
chandler,"Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.",3,3
ross,"No! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here.  Okay, you are in bed...",3,3
chandler,Yeah.,3,3
ross,I'm going to use the cushion.,3,3
chandler,Yeah.,3,3
ross,"Okay, you are in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you roll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.",3,3
chandler,"Okay, the old hug and roll.",3,3
ross,Yep.,3,3
chandler,"Okay, one question.",3,3
ross,Shoot.,3,3
chandler,you are pretending the pillow's a girl right?,3,3
joey,Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?,3,3
rachel,you are so pretty.,3,3
phoebe,Hi!,3,3
all,"Hey, Phoebe.",3,3
phoebe,"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.",3,3
joey,You talked to him. Are you crazy?,3,3
phoebe,"Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but Because he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that is why, that is why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. Because of the restraining order.",3,3
chandler,"Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.",3,3
phoebe,"Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.",3,3
ross,"Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.",3,3
phoebe,"No, I'm just going to help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.",3,3
joey,"Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean",3,3
phoebe,"Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.",3,3
monica,Hey guys.,3,3
all,Hey Mon.,3,3
monica,"Joey, this is for you.  It's blackberry curin.",3,3

monica,"Joey, take your time with that. that is my last batch.",3,3
joey,No more jam?!,3,3
rachel,"Well, what happened to your jam plan?",3,3

chandler,"Well, your going to need much bigger jars.",3,3
ross,What are you talking about?,3,3
monica,I'm talking about me having a baby.,3,3
ross,What?,3,3
rachel,Are you serious?,3,3
monica,"Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that is when I came up with the baby plan.",3,3
ross,"Well, aren't you forgetting' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!",3,3
monica,"It took me 28 years to find one man that I want to spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that is just stupid.",3,3
chandler,"That, that is what's stupid.",3,3
monica,"I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.",3,3
rachel,Down at the docks again?,3,3
janice,Night-night Bing-a-ling.,3,3
chandler,"Night-night.....Janice.  'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time.

phoebe,"Oh, yeah. What's this?",3,3
malcom,"Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you want to here something from it?",3,3
phoebe,"Um, not even a little bit.",3,3
malcom,It's about you.,3,3
phoebe,"Oh, okay then.",3,3
malcom,"I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me even though I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kind of cool.",3,3
phoebe,Good. So what were you thinking?,3,3
malcom,I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.,3,3
phoebe,Really?,3,3
malcom,No.,3,3
phoebe,Oh.,3,3
malcom,"See that is just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.",3,3
phoebe,"Oh, okay.",3,3
chandler,"No, that is all right. I just had a jar of mustard.",3,3
monica,"Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2"", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.",3,3
chandler,You mean there's more than one of us.,3,3
ross,"Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm going to, I'm, I'm going to.....",3,3
monica,you are going to what?,3,3
ross,I'm going to tell Mom.,3,3
rachel,"Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you are crazy.",3,3
ross,Crazy.,3,3
monica,What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....,3,3
ross,"Oh, it's not the ideal way...",3,3
monica,"Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?",3,3
joey,Check it out!! Jam crackers!,3,3
monica,"Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy.  Oh my God, under personal comments",3,3
joey,"Yeah, the Knicks rule!",3,3
monica,"Joey, this is you!",3,3
joey,"Let me see.  Oh, right.",3,3
rachel,When did you go to a sperm bank?,3,3
joey,"Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU.  Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?",3,3
chandler,And that is how you bought it?,3,3
joey,"No, that is what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kind of surprised there's any of my boys left.",3,3
monica,"Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.",3,3
joey,"Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.",3,3
phoebe,Hello!,3,3
all,Hey.,3,3
ross,How's the maniac?,3,3
phoebe,"Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissing'.",3,3
rachel,"Phoebe, what are you doing?",3,3
phoebe,"Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.",3,3
rachel,"Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.",3,3
phoebe,"Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.",3,3
ross,you are taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?,3,3
phoebe,"What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?",3,3
chandler,"Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.",3,3
phoebe,What are you saying I should do?,3,3
monica,"I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.",3,3
phoebe,"Thank you, Monica.",3,3
joey,"Or, you could follow him and see where he goes.",3,3
monica,"Oh, that is what I would do, forget mine.",3,3
rachel,"Oh my God, what happened?",3,3
janice,"Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!",3,3
rachel,Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.,3,3
janice,"Oh,  I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.",3,3
rachel,Ross's what?,3,3
janice,"You know what, where he hugs you and kind of rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.",3,3
malcom,Phoebe?,3,3
phoebe,Yes? Yes! Oh.,3,3
malcom,What are you doing?,3,3
phoebe,"Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.",3,3
malcom,Were you following me?,3,3
phoebe,"Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.",3,3
malcom,So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.,3,3
phoebe,"Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walking' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?",3,3
malcom,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.",3,3
phoebe,"No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, Because I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, Because your, you know  Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.",3,3
malcom,"Uh-huh, I don't know.",3,3
phoebe,"Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I going to go?",3,3

monica,"Afraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...",3,3
joey,"No kidding', hmm.",3,3
monica,What?,3,3
joey,"No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.",3,3
monica,Really? Why?,3,3
joey,"I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.",3,3
monica,Hoyt?,3,3
joey,"It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.",3,3
monica,"Really, is he a swimmer?",3,3
joey,He's got the body for it.,3,3
monica,I like that.  What?,3,3
joey,You guys have one of those signs that says,3,3
monica,We do not have one of those signs.,3,3
joey,"Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.",3,3
monica,Two girls and a boy?,3,3
joey,Yeah!,3,3
monica,"And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.",3,3
joey,"Sure!  But hey, you know this way sounds good too.",3,3
monica,Yeah.,3,3
joey,"Oh Monica.  Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool,  for like a day. .",3,3
joey,"I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribbiani. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it  Maybe if they met me in person.",3,3
rachel,"Honey, you got a little thing on your...",3,3
joey,Did I get it?,3,3
rachel,Yeah.,3,3
ross,Hello.,3,3
rachel,Hello.,3,3
ross,"Hey.  Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?",3,3
chandler,Sure. What's up?,3,3
ross,"Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!",3,3
host,"Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!",3,4
phoebe,"Oh, oh! It's on again!",3,4
joey,"You guys, can we please not watch this all right.",3,4
all,Shh!,3,4
host,"Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flinging'-flangin' hard to open.",3,4
joey,"Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!",3,4
mike,And there is Kevin.,3,4
joey,Can we please turn this off?,3,4
rachel,"No way, Kevin.",3,4
mike,There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.,3,4
ross,Are you intrigued?,3,4
chandler,you are flingin'-flangin' right I am!,3,4
mike,"Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you are going to see how easy this is to do.  Go ahead.  This works with any milk carton.",3,4
joey,"Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.",3,4
chandler,"Well, it's official there are no good movies.",3,4
janice,"Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.",3,4
monica,"Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back.",3,4
joey,Hey!,3,4
phoebe,Hey.,3,4
chandler,"Hey, man. What's up?",3,4
joey,Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!,3,4
chandler,"Well, I'll tell you I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.",3,4
phoebe,"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!",3,4
joey,How is it you?,3,4
phoebe,"Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.",3,4
joey,"Yep, that is my audition.",3,4
monica,"See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.",3,4
phoebe,"Yep, and that is why we don't invite you to play.",3,4
janice,What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.,3,4
joey,"Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.",3,4
phoebe,That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.,3,4
joey,"Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.",3,4
phoebe,"What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .",3,4
joey,"What, what are you doing? What are you doing?",3,4
phoebe,"No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh.  'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'",3,4
joey,"Hang up, hang up.",3,4
phoebe,"'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'",3,4
chandler,Is anybody else scared?,3,4
phoebe,"'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?'  I need a pen.",3,4
chandler,Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!,3,4
monica,"Oh, now you want a pad.",3,4
carol and susan,Hey!!,3,4
ross,"There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi  What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?",3,4
carol,"He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.",3,4
susan,"He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.",3,4
ross,"Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?",3,4
susan,So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you are afraid he's going to grow up and be in show business.,3,4
carol,"This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?",3,4
ross,"You know what it's fine. If you are okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.",3,4
ross,"Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck?  No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-solider?",3,4
rachel,"Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?",3,4
monica,I got to go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?,3,4
joey,I love that movie.,3,4
monica,"There it is. Joey, what are you doing?",3,4
joey,"I'm sorry, it just felt nice.",3,4
chandler,Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.,3,4
joey,"Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.",3,4
chandler,"Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight.  Oh, that is great I'm going to have to see her tonight.",3,4
rachel,What's the big deal? Why don't you want to see Janice?,3,4
chandler,"Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.",3,4
ross,"And that is bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?",3,4
chandler,No.,3,4
ross,"You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.",3,4
chandler,"No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head",3,4
rachel,Men are unbelievable.,3,4
monica,"What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?",3,4
chandler,"I know, that,  that is why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.",3,4
monica,"Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.",3,4
joey,"Hey, you know about that?!",3,4
chandler,"Look what do I do? I want to get past this, I don't want to be afraid of the commitment thing. I want to go through the tunnel, to the other side!",3,4
ross,Where there is no fear of commitment.,3,4
chandler,Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?,3,4
joey,"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, Because as I understand it, you are not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you are afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",3,4
rachel,"Amazingly, that makes sense.",3,4
chandler,You think?,3,4
joey,"Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!",3,4
chandler,"Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.",3,4
phoebe,"Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?",3,4
rachel,"Sure Pheebs, you know, that is what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.",3,4
joey,"Come on baby, come on!",3,4
phoebe,"'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'",3,4
rachel,Very nice touch.,3,4
phoebe,"'Okay, go ahead.'  Um, hi Annie.  Fantastic!  You got it.  Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that,  except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.",3,4
rachel,Unbelievable.,3,4
joey,Thank you so much.,3,4
phoebe,"It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.",3,4
joey,"You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favour, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.",3,4
phoebe,"Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.",3,4
joey,"Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.",3,4
phoebe,Two?,3,4
joey,"Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. you are so good at it. I love you.",3,4
phoebe,"Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right",3,4
joey,"Nooo, four.",3,4
janice,"So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?",3,4
chandler,"Because, I wanted to uh, give you this.",3,4
janice,"oh, are you a puppy!  Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you are sleeping with gives you contact paper.",3,4
chandler,"Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.",3,4
janice,"Oh, you didn't have to do this.",3,4
chandler,"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you are my girlfriend, and that is what girlfriends should, should get.",3,4
janice,"Well, I got to buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.",3,4
chandler,"Well, not me. But that is what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.",3,4
janice,We should?,3,4
chandler,"Yep, we're a couple and that is what couples do. And, I want to meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!",3,4
janice,"I don't think we need to, because you are tripping me out right now! Are you okay?",3,4
chandler,"I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.",3,4
janice,You probably want us to move in together?,3,4
chandler,It doesn't scare me!,3,4
janice,"Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you are talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...",3,4
chandler,"Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared you'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!  Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just want to apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.",3,4
rachel,"Honey, this will help.",3,4
chandler,"So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.",3,4
rachel and monica,Uff.,3,4
monica,That is never good.,3,4
chandler,Then I got all needy and clingy.,3,4
rachel,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?",3,4
chandler,She said she'd call me.,3,4
rachel and monica,OH!,3,4
chandler,Oh God.,3,4
monica,Welcome to our side of the tunnel.,3,4
chandler,This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.,3,4
rachel,"Yeah, well that is that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.",3,4
monica,"You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you got to switch to low-fat.",3,4
rachel,"Yeah, you do.",3,4
chandler,"So, you don't think I'm terminal?",3,4
monica,"Well, no, not at all, you are not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.",3,4
chandler,"Okay, okay. So, should I call her?",3,4
rachel and monica,Nooo!,3,4
rachel,"This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.",3,4
monica,She has to know that your not ready.,3,4
rachel,"Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.",3,4
chandler,"So I'm not, not going to lose her?",3,4
rachel,"Ooh, honey, you are not a total loser.",3,4
chandler,"I said, 'So I'm not going to lose her?'",3,4
rachel,Oh.,3,4
ross,"Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.",3,4
rachel,G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's going to fall for that?,3,4
joey,G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?,3,4
ross,"Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!",3,4
joey and ross,Go Joe!!!,3,4
phoebe,Hello! Oh!,3,4
joey,Pheebs! There you are!,3,4
phoebe,"No it's not, sorry.",3,4
joey,"But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!",3,4
phoebe,"Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.",3,4
joey,"Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.",3,4
phoebe,"Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",3,4
joey,"It's okay, these things happen.",3,4
phoebe,"But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you are, you are in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't want to be the person who makes your face look like that.",3,4
joey,"I'm, I'm okay. See.",3,4
phoebe,"Oh, now you are sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.",3,4
joey,"No! No, no you can't quit! you are the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.",3,4
phoebe,"Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.",3,4
joey,They actually said that?,3,4
phoebe,"Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...",3,4
joey,"No, no, no, see that is why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this.  I canna work on a new accent.",3,4
phoebe,"Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.",3,4
ross,"You'll never get me, Joe!!!",3,4

janice,What woman?!,3,4
chandler,Chelsea.,3,4
janice,"Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you are seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you are pretending that you are seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?",3,4
chandler,Can I be that guy?,3,4
phoebe,"Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.",3,4

phoebe,"Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that is 'pretty dumb.'",3,4
joey,"Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm going to have to go back to Estelle.",3,4
phoebe,Oh.,3,4
joey,"Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you are a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.",3,4
phoebe,"Yeah, no, I understand.",3,4
joey,"You do, thanks.",3,4
phoebe,Yeah. Sorry.,3,4
joey,Wait a minute.,3,4
phoebe,What?,3,4

phoebe,"Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.",3,4

chandler,"....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.",3,4
monica,"My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.",3,4

monica,"Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.",3,4
rachel,"Yes, and grumpy.",3,4
chandler,"What are you, stop naming dwarves!  Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry.  Really?!  Really?!",3,4
rachel,"He's so lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.",3,4
chandler,I love you too.,3,4
monica,"Aw, it's so unfair.",3,4

rachel,"Well relax, he’ll be here.",3,5
phoebe,"No, I know, I’m just nervous. You know it’s just you know Mom’s dead, don’t talk to my sister, Grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately. It’s like the last desperate chance to have a family, you know, kind of thing. You’re so sweet to wait with me.",3,5

isabella,Aren’t you with that girl over there?,3,5
ross,"Well, yeah, kind of. Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I’m allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it’s flattery.",3,5
isabella,I’m sorry.,3,5
ross,"Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don’t, don’t just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...",3,5

ross,"Um, see, but that’s not the final draft.",3,5
isabella,It’s laminated!,3,5
ross,"Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.",3,5
isabella,You know it’s ironic...,3,5
ross,What?,3,5
isabella,...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.,3,5
ross,We’re just going to be friends.,3,5

janice,"Come on over the years none of you ever you know, got drunk and stupid.",3,6
joey,"Well, that’s really a different question.",3,6
janice,I’m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.,3,6
joey,"Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.",3,6
monica and rachel,What?!!,3,6
rachel,"Excuse me, there was no time!",3,6
joey,"Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go?",3,6
janice,"Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?",3,6
rachel,Does anybody need more coffee?,3,6
ross,"Yeah, I’ll take some.",3,6
joey,"Hey, there’s a dog out there!",3,6

phoebe,Bye-bye!  That’s why I moved out.,3,6
ross,"Hey, you know while we’re on that, when are you going to tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.",3,6
phoebe,I think on some levels she already knows.,3,6
ross,"Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.",3,6
phoebe,"Okay, well maybe not on those levels.",3,6
chandler,Hey.,3,6
ross,Hey.,3,6
chandler,"I’m never going to find a roommate, ever.",3,6
phoebe,"Why, nobody good?",3,6
chandler,"Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!",3,6
ross,So how many more do you have tomorrow?,3,6
chandler,"Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’",3,6
monica,"Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!",3,6
ross,"Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.",3,6

chandler,"Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do you do?",3,6
eric,"Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that’s cool.",3,6
chandler,"Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here you know......never.",3,6
eric,"Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’s beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.",3,6
chandler,"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good.  All right.",3,6

rachel,"Yeah, I know.",3,6
friend no. 1,What?,3,6
rachel,"Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, you know, just to sort of get it out of my system.",3,6
friend no. 1,Rachel stop!,3,6
friend no. 2,You’re so bad!,3,6
rachel,"I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex you know, with the next guy that I see.",3,6
chandler,"Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.",3,6

joey,Like you wouldn’t believe.  Wow! This is a great place.,3,6
monica,Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.,3,6
joey,Gotcha.,3,6
monica,"This place is really my Grandmother’s.  I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?",3,6
joey,"Oh, you bet I am!",3,6
monica,"Okay, here’s your penis!",3,6

joey,"Whoa, ah!! We’re you just going to give me some lemonade?",3,6
monica,Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!,3,6
joey,"Oh right, right.",3,6
monica,"I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they want to have sex?",3,6
joey,"Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk.",3,6
monica,"It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.",3,6
monica,Pheebs?,3,6
phoebe,Huh?,3,6
monica,Where’s your bed?,3,6
phoebe,It’s not in the apartment?  Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again.,3,6

phoebe,"Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live here anymore.",3,6
monica,What are you talking about?,3,6
phoebe,"I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t know how to tell you, but you know everybody else knows!",3,6
monica,Everybody knows!,3,6
phoebe,"That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.",3,6
monica,"Well, you-you could have just turned the cushion over.",3,6
phoebe,"Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.",3,6
monica,What?!?!,3,6
phoebe,"Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.",3,6
monica,You can spill. In the sink.,3,6
phoebe,"Aw, honey it’s not your fault, you know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening.",3,6
monica,"I love you, too.",3,6
phoebe,"Aww, good.  What?",3,6
monica,What? I’m just said.,3,6
phoebe,"No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.",3,6
chandler,"So ah, what are you watching?",3,6
joey,Baywatch.,3,6
chandler,What’s it about?,3,6
joey,Lifeguards.,3,6

joey,Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.,3,6
chandler,Wow! Look at them run.,3,6
joey,"They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?",3,6

chandler,You okay?,3,6
monica,Phoebe moved out.,3,6
chandler,Right.,3,6
monica,"I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don’t have a boyfriend?",3,6
chandler,"No!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.",3,6
monica,"Well, I think so.",3,6
chandler,"Oh-ho, come here.  Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life.",3,6

ross,"My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kind of over.",3,6

phoebe,"Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.",3,6
ross,"I’m an idiot. I mean should have seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross you know look at her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool!",3,6
phoebe,"Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?",3,6
ross,"Well, now I do!!",3,6
phoebe,I’m sorry.,3,6
ross,"Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever....",3,6
phoebe,"Aw, God Ross. Oh.",3,6
chandler,"Umm, this is nice.",3,6
monica,"I know, it is isn’t it?",3,6
chandler,"No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?",3,6
monica,"Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.",3,6
chandler,"Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.",3,6
monica,"Well, if you want to get a drink later we can.",3,6
chandler,"Oh yeah, that sounds great.  Oh, and listen, it’s, it’s going to be....",3,6
monica,I know. Thanks.,3,6
ross,"Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!",3,6
phoebe,"I know no, no, you know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross. You’re, you’re really, you’re so good.",3,6

phoebe,"Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear.",3,6
ross,"No, come on don’t start.  Ouch!",3,6
phoebe,What?,3,6
ross,Stupid balls are in the way.,3,6
ross,Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.,3,6
phoebe,You have chalk on your face.,3,6
ross,Huh?,3,6
phoebe,"Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass.",3,6

chandler,What a wank!,3,7
janice,"Oh, I cannot believe he’s using our divorce to sell mattresses.",3,7

phoebe,"Yeah, I can’t say croissant.  Oh my God!",3,7

joey,"Good evening. I’m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as  Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days of Our Lives,  I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don’t have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this.  Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.",3,7
joey,Hi!,3,7
phoebe,Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?,3,7
joey,"Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’Hey, the bell doesn’t dismiss you, I dismiss you.’",3,7

joey,"Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.",3,7
phoebe,"Oh, yay!",3,7

ross,It’s not a library...,3,7
dr. green,"I know!! It’s a museum! What, you’re the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.",3,7
ross,"So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat.",3,7

rachel,Yeah. That’s Daddy.,3,7
ross,That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.,3,7
rachel,"Yes, it bothers me Ross, but you know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers.",3,7
ross,So?,3,7
rachel,"So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not going to change.",3,7
ross,You really serve people sneezers?,3,7
rachel,"Well um, I don’t.",3,7

ross,"The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.",3,7
dr. green,What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?,3,7
ross,"Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.",3,7
rachel,"Yeah it is, it is.  We really, really have to do something about that.",3,7
ross,I know.,3,7
dr. green,"Excuse me, you think I’m cheap?",3,7
rachel,"Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t.",3,7
ross,"Nothing I do means anything, really.",3,7
dr. green,"This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I’ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.",3,7
ross,Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’.,3,7
joey,"Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I want to convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’  Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.  And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.",3,7
student,"Hey, Mr. Trib.",3,7
joey,Hey-hey.,3,7
student,"Guess what, I got an audition!",3,7
joey,"Aww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.",3,7
student,I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?,3,7
joey,You bet! What’s the part?,3,7
student,"Oh it’s great, it’s a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.",3,7
rachel,"You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.",3,7
ross,Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.,3,7
rachel,"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",3,7
ross,"Yeah, I’m going to go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.",3,7
ross,"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",3,7
phoebe,"I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kind of trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?",3,7
rachel,Um. yeah.,3,7
phoebe,I am so dead.,3,7
rachel,"All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",3,7
ross,"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.",3,7
rachel,"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",3,7
ross,"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’",3,7
rachel,"Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",3,7
ross,"Rachel one brunch is not going to solve anything. You got to face it, okay we’re never going to get along.",3,7
rachel,"Okay, well you are just going to have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t want to have to have a separate room for you too!!",3,7
ross,"Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels.",3,7
monica,What’s this?,3,7
phoebe,Isn’t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!,3,7
monica,This is not the bed I ordered!,3,7
phoebe,"I know, you must’ve won like a contest or something!",3,7
monica,Phoebe!,3,7
monica,Why is this car in my bedroom?,3,7
phoebe,"I’m sorry, okay, I-I wasn’t looking, and the store says that they won’t take it back because you signed for it...",3,7
monica,When did I sign for it?,3,7
phoebe,"When I was you! You know what, it’s all Joey’s fault, because he left his nose open!",3,7
monica,Did you make brownies today?,3,7
chandler,"Knock, knock.",3,7
monica,"Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.",3,7
chandler,"Hey, I’m going for sushi does anybody want..  Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.",3,7
phoebe,It’s Monica’s bed. What?,3,7
chandler,Okay.  It’s a race car.,3,7
phoebe,"So. This has always been Monica’s bed, what you’re just noticing now, how self-involved are you?",3,7
chandler,"Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?",3,7
monica,Sometimes I have bad dreams.,3,7
student,"Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not going to be me, not me.",3,7
joey,Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?,3,7
student,No.,3,7
joey,Whoa. That was really good.,3,7
student,"Thanks, any suggestions?",3,7
chandler,You told him to play the boxer gay!!,3,7
joey,"Well, I-I might’ve said super gay.",3,7
chandler,You totally screwed him over.,3,7
monica,"Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?",3,7
joey,"Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want this part.",3,7
phoebe,"Well, if you really, really want it, then it’s okay.",3,7

ross,"Oh, please. Sweetie it’s hopeless, okay, I’m just going to go.",3,7
rachel,What?!,3,7
ross,"Look, look I’m sorry. It’s just that....",3,7

rachel,With my alignment. I’ve got one leg shorter than the other.,3,7
dr. green,Oh God!,3,7
ross,Argue with that.,3,7
rachel,"What? It’s true, my right leg is two inches shorter.",3,7
dr. green,Come on! You’re just titling!  Her legs are fine!,3,7
ross,I know that!,3,7
dr. green,"So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?",3,7
rachel,"I’m sorry, let her?",3,7
ross,"What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance either.",3,7
dr. green,"Wait a minute, you don’t have renter’s insurance?!",3,7
rachel,No.,3,7
dr. green,Well what if somebody steals something? How are you going to run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!,3,7
ross,"Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?",3,7
dr. green,I’d love some juice. Thanks.,3,7
ross,Okay.  Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?,3,7
rachel,"Yeah honey, I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tell him about the mole I haven’t got checked yet.",3,7
ross,Excellent!,3,7
joey,"There will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he’s got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.  Thank you.",3,7
jester,"Uh, may I help you?",3,7
monica,"Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck with the race car bed.",3,7
jester,"Look, it’s like I told you, there’s nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.",3,7
joey,"All right, Jester man, look we want to see the king.",3,7
jester,Nobody sees the king!,3,7
joey,"Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king.",3,7
jester,Hey! You can’t go back there!,3,7
janice,Oh my God.,3,7
chandler,"Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom!  Hey-hey good looking’!  Varrrrrrrrroom.  All right, I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring.",3,7
rachel,Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?,3,8
chandler,I will have one.,3,8
chandler,"Okay, I’m not going to have one.",3,8
ross,Neither will I.,3,8
phoebe,"No, no, it’s just my tooth.",3,8
chandler,All right I’ll have one.,3,8
ross,"So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.",3,8
phoebe,"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.",3,8
chandler,See that is the problem with invisible dentists.,3,8
ross,Why? Why can’t you go to him?,3,8
phoebe,"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.",3,8
chandler,"That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist’s blouse.",3,8
rachel,"Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!",3,8
phoebe,"Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.",3,8
rachel,And all these people actually died?,3,8
phoebe,"Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now, you know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!",3,8
ross,"Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a coincidence.",3,8
phoebe,"Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.",3,8
ross,"Thanks, Gunther.   Hey!  Umm, can I get a napkin too?",3,8
gunther,"Oh, like you don’t already have everything.",3,8
phoebe,Ow! Ow!,3,8
rachel,"Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.",3,8
phoebe,"All right, fine, fine, but if you’re my next victim, don’t come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.",3,8
rachel,I promise.,3,8
phoebe,"Although, don’t feel like you can’t visit.",3,8
joey,"Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?",3,8
ross,"No, no he’s not.",3,8
monica,"You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.",3,8
ross,"What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?",3,8
joey,"Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.",3,8
rachel,"Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.",3,8
joey,"It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him.",3,8
phoebe,"Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll kill him.",3,8
joey,Eww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It’s like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.,3,8
phoebe,"Well, I’m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just want to, I just want to tell you all that um......",3,8
ross,"Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.",3,8
joey,What did they do?,3,8
ross,"Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.",3,8
monica,"So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?",3,8
ross,"Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you.",3,8
rachel,Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?,3,8
ross,"You? You! Want to watch Ben?  Yes! That’d be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.",3,8
joey,"Hey-hey, Ross?",3,8
ross,Yeah.,3,8
joey,I’ve got a science question.,3,8
ross,Hmm?,3,8
joey,"If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ‘Homo-sapiens’, is that why there extinct?",3,8
ross,"Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.",3,8
joey,"Hey-hey, I’m not judging.",3,8
rachel,"Look Benny, spoon.  Spoon. Come on! All right, you know what I think he’s bored.",3,8
monica,"Here. Ben, do you want to play the airplane game, do you want to show Rachel? Come here.  We’re going to do something fun. Okay.  Weee!!  Weee!!",3,8
monica,"Who’s so brave, you’re so brave, yes you are, you’re so brave.",3,8
rachel,"Okay. Okay honey, he’s fine, he’s fine, let’s just put him down. Come here, Ben.  See that’s a good boy.  How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!",3,8
monica,"He’s not going to say anything, because we’re not going to tell him.",3,8
rachel,We’re not?!,3,8
monica,No we’re not.,3,8
rachel,"All right, I like that.",3,8
monica,Okay.,3,8
rachel,"So we’re okay, we’re okay, we’re okay,  aren’t we? No, we’re not okay, we’re not okay, there’s a bump, there’s a bump.",3,8
monica,Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!,3,8
rachel,I cannot push it in!,3,8
monica,"Okay, we’re going to need a distraction.",3,8
rachel,"Okay, okay, okay.",3,8
monica,I got it!,3,8
rachel,Okay.,3,8
monica,"The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go,  rweee!!",3,8
rachel,Or. We could put a hat on his head.,3,8
monica,A hat! Yes! We need a hat.,3,8
rachel,We need a hat..,3,8
monica,Where are we going to find a tiny little hat?,3,8
rachel,"Oh, oh, oh, I’ll get ‘Rainy Day Bear’!!",3,8
monica,"Because he’ll know what to do?  Oh my God, you’re a genius!",3,8
rachel,"Oh God, oh God, it’s sowed on though.",3,8
monica,Give it. Give it.,3,8
rachel,Okay.,3,8
monica and rachel,Oh!!,3,8
rachel,"Oh, it’s just like a bloodbath in here today.",3,8
chandler,"Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?",3,8
joey,I’d really prefer a mountain bike.,3,8
chandler,"Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something special. Come in here with me.",3,8
joey,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something special, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.",3,8
chandler,"That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.",3,8
joey,"Oh, you want something serious. You know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.",3,8
chandler,"All right. Look, I’m going to go in here, and you don’t buy me anything ever.",3,8
joey,"No, no, you can’t, you can’t, okay, you can’t, you can’t buy her pearls, you just can’t, you can’t, you can’t.",3,8
chandler,Why not?!,3,8
joey,"Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...",3,8
chandler,What is the thing?,3,8
joey,"Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.",3,8
chandler,What?,3,8
joey,They were in his office.,3,8
chandler,"Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.",3,8
joey,"I’m telling you man, I saw it.",3,8
chandler,"Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.",3,8
joey,"I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?",3,8
monica,It just makes more sense as an ensemble.,3,8
rachel,Right.,3,8
monica,"Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.",3,8
phoebe,No! Oh! You’re alive! You’re alive!,3,8
rachel,"See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn’t I?",3,8
phoebe,"Yeah, well, we’ll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just want to call everyone I know.",3,8
monica,"Sure, we have no money, go ahead.",3,8
phoebe,"‘Hey! You’re not dead! Okay, see you!’",3,8
ben,Monica.,3,8
monica,Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?,3,8
ben,Monica bang!,3,8
rachel,"Okay, I heard that.",3,8

rachel,Uh-huh.,3,8
monica,Oh my God! He’s going to rat me out!,3,8

monica,You okay?,3,8
rachel,"Oh yeah! you know, if it’s not a headboard, it’s just not worth it.",3,8
janice,How’s my Bing-a-ling?,3,8
chandler,"Ah, I don’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, want to tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.",3,8
janice,Why are your eyes so white?,3,8
chandler,"You tell me! Maybe, it’s because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!",3,8
janice,Oh my God!!,3,8
chandler,All right!,3,8
janice,How did you know?,3,8
chandler,"Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.",3,8
janice,In the park?,3,8
chandler,No! In his office! How many kisses were there?,3,8
janice,Just those two!,3,8
chandler,"Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!",3,8
janice,"Oh, I’m sorry honey, I’m so, so,  haaaaa! I’m so, so sorry, I just  haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can’t breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?",3,8
chandler,Here.,3,8
janice,The receipt.,3,8
chandler,"I’ll take it! All right look, I got to know. Are you finished with me?  Are you finished with him?  Do you still love him?  Do you still love me?  All right look,  I’m going to need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?",3,8
janice,I don’t know.,3,8
phoebe,Okay. If you’re alive you answer your phone!,3,8
monica,"Okay, Ben, I won’t tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don’t tell about our little bonking incident.",3,8
rachel,"Monica, number one, I don’t think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!",3,8
joey,You said number two.,3,8
rachel,I also said number one.,3,8
joey,I know.,3,8
ross,Hey! Everyone.,3,8
rachel,Hi!,3,8
ross,How’s my little boy?,3,8
rachel,"He’s perfect, he’s never been better.",3,8

ben,Monica.,3,8
ross,"Oh my God, he just said your name, that’s great! Good job Ben.",3,8
ben,Monica bang!,3,8
monica,"Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.",3,8
phoebe,"Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.",3,8
joey,Uh.,3,8
phoebe,What?,3,8
joey,Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.,3,8
phoebe,"Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.",3,8
rachel,Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.,3,8
joey,"I’m telling’ you, he hasn’t moved since this morning.",3,8
monica,"All right, we should call somebody.",3,8
ross,And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t moving.,3,8
rachel,"Well, we have got to find out if he’s alive.",3,8
monica,How are we going to do that? There’s no way.,3,8
joey,"Well, there is one way. His window’s open, I say, we poke him.",3,8
joey,"Hey! you know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?",3,8
chandler,Yeah.,3,8
joey,"Well, now we got a reason.",3,8
chandler,What?,3,8
joey,"Well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device.",3,8
chandler,All right.,3,8
joey,"Hey uh, what’s a matter?",3,8
chandler,I talked to Janice.,3,8
joey,"Oh my God, is she going back to him?",3,8
chandler,"She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. You know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. You know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on the receipt!",3,8
joey,"What are you ah, what are you going to do?",3,8
chandler,"I don’t know, you know. What, what, would you do?",3,8
joey,"Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.",3,8
chandler,"Come on, tell me.",3,8
joey,"All right, you’re probably not going to want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me,  I would ah, I would bow out.",3,8
chandler,"What?  What are you, what are you talking about?",3,8
joey,"They have a kid together, you know. They’re like, they’re like a family, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you want to ah, come poke a nude guy?",3,8
ross,"Well, he’s finally asleep. About that ah, bump on his head?",3,8
rachel,"Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.",3,8
ross,"It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, you know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.",3,8
rachel,I did!,3,8
ross,I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.,3,8
rachel,I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!,3,8
ross,Monica did it?,3,8
ross,Monica?,3,8
monica,Yeah.,3,8
ross,"Umm, did you notice anything weird about Ben today?",3,8
monica,No. Why?,3,8
ross,"Well, I was just playing with him, and you know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head.",3,8
monica,Really?!,3,8
ross,"Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walking’ kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of you know...",3,8
monica,"Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!",3,8
rachel,I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.,3,8
monica,You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!,3,8
ross,Monica bang! Monica bang!  Ow!,3,8
rachel,I’ll get the hat.,3,8
chandler,"Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not going to be easy.",3,8
janice,Okay.,3,8
chandler,"I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t want to be the guy that breaks up a family, you know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think you know ‘You’re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.",3,8
janice,Wow!,3,8
chandler,"Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.",3,8
janice,"Oh! You’re right. Oh God. But, before I can say ‘good-bye’, there’s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it’s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie’s been singing about.

joey,"Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t play, everyone will be mad at you because the teams won’t be even. Come on.",3,9

monica,"Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind of competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose.",3,9
ross,"It was so not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.",3,9
monica,"To score the winning touchdown, by the way.",3,9
ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.",3,9
monica,I won the game.,3,9
ross,Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?,3,9
rachel,"Um, there was a Geller Cup?",3,9
ross,"Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and....  threw it in the lake.",3,9

phoebe,Woo-yay!!,3,9
monica,"No! Listen, I’m not going to go through this with you again, okay. Just once I want to beat when you can’t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let’s just call this, tie score and it’s halftime.",3,9
ross,"Okay, first of all, I don’t play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!",3,9

monica,"All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I’ll take care of the rest.",3,9
joey,Okay.,3,9
monica,Break!,3,9
joey,Here you go!,3,9

monica,"You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’re winning because I’m better than you.",3,9
monica,"Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, you know what, I’ll prove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win the game.",3,9
ross,"What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica, because I’m only down by three touchdowns.",3,9

ross,"Right. Okay, let’s play. Let’s go.",3,9
chandler,"No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?",3,9
joey,"Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.",3,9

chandler,Yes!!,3,9
joey,Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn’t understand the question.,3,9
chandler,"Well, you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.",3,9
margha,"I’m sorry, Joey, that is my chose.",3,9
chandler,"You hear that! That is her chose, mister I’ll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!",3,9
margha,"I’m now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.",3,9
chandler,Wh-what?,3,9
margha,"I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.",3,9
joey,Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.,3,9
chandler,"You know what, it doesn’t matter, because she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!",3,9
ross,"Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.",3,9
chandler,We’re not going to lose to girls.,3,9
ross,Hey! It’s 42-21!,3,9
joey,"This sucks, I was just up by that much!",3,9
monica,Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.,3,9

ross,Let go! Let go!,3,9
monica,Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!,3,9

monica,Let go!,3,9
chandler,"Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.",3,10

gunther,Rachel?,3,10
rachel,Yeah.,3,10
gunther,"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?",3,10

sarah,"So that’s two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.",3,10
ross,"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",3,10
chandler,"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.",3,10
ross,Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.,3,10
chandler,I was shrieking... like a Marine.,3,10
ross,All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.,3,10

rachel,I’m going to get back to retraining.,3,10
ross,"All right, see you guys.",3,10
chandler,"Look out kids, he’s coming!",3,10

phoebe,"Have fun. Oh wait, no, don’t! I forgot I am totally against that now.",3,10
joey,What? Me having a job?,3,10
phoebe,"No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights.  Hey, how do you sleep at night?",3,10
joey,"Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.",3,10
phoebe,Really?,3,10
chandler,"Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it’s the only chance to see New York.",3,10
gunther,"...and after you’ve delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....",3,10
rachel,"Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.",3,10
gunther,What if you put them here.,3,10
rachel,"Huh. Well, you know that’s actually a really good idea, because that way they’ll be closer to the mugs. You know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.",3,10
gunther,They already do. That’s why they call it the 'tray spot.’,3,10
rachel,"Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry.",3,10
gunther,It’s all right. Sweetheart.,3,10
ross,"So, this must be kind of neat for you, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore.",3,10
sarah,"Well, I kind of wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Space camp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.",3,10
ross,"Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?",3,10
sarah,"Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he’d be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.",3,10
ross,I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.,3,10
sarah,"No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he’s going to double the college money my Grandma left me.",3,10
ross,"Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?",3,10
sarah,The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.,3,10
ross,Yeah.,3,10
sarah,"So far, I’ve sold seventy-five.",3,10
ross,"Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able.  How much are the boxes?",3,10
sarah,Five dollars a box.,3,10
ross,And what is second prize?,3,10
sarah,"A ten speed bike. But, I’d rather have something my Dad couldn’t sell.",3,10
ross,"Well, that makes sense.",3,10
sarah,"Could you do me one favour, if it’s not too much trouble?",3,10
ross,"Yeah, Sarah, anything.",3,10
sarah,"Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are going to be on the news, and since we don’t have a TV, the lady across the alley said she’d push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.",3,10
woman,Yes?,3,10
ross,"Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies.",3,10
woman,"You’re no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.",3,10
ross,"No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird",3,10
woman,What does that mean?,3,10
ross,"Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.",3,10
woman,"I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, you know. Now, go away!",3,10
ross,"No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Space camp more than anything in the world.",3,10
woman,"I’m pressing, a policeman is on his way.",3,10
ross,"Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going.",3,10
woman,I can still see you!,3,10
ross,All right!!,3,10
phoebe,Hey.,3,10
joey,"Hey. What, what are you doing here?",3,10
phoebe,"Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah,  oh, but oh...",3,10
joey,"Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....",3,10
phoebe,Destiny.,3,10
joey,Sure.,3,10
phoebe,Yes.,3,10
joey,All right.,3,10
phoebe,Okay.  Yikes! That one doesn’t look very fulfilled.,3,10
joey,"Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just taking it to the back.",3,10
phoebe,"You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.",3,10
joey,Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.,3,10
phoebe,"So, what happens to the old guys?",3,10
joey,"Well, they go into the chipper.",3,10
phoebe,"Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds?  No! No!!!",3,10
joey,Hey! Hey!!,3,10
ross,"...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.",3,10
joey,"All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s.",3,10
ross,"Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl to Space camp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?",3,10
chandler,"Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?",3,10
ross,"No, but ah, there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I’ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.",3,10
ross,Mon?,3,10
monica,"All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds.  Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?",3,10
ross,"Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, you know I’m sure that’s not going to happen this time, why don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph’s.",3,10
monica,No.,3,10
ross,"Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘them.",3,10
monica,"Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this.",3,10
ross,"I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free.",3,10
monica,Oh God! I got to go!,3,10
ross,Come on! All the cool kids are eating ‘them!,3,10
gunther,"And when you have a second later, I want to show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.",3,10
rachel,"I’m training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.",3,10
joey,"Look Rach, wasn’t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?",3,10
rachel,"Well, yeah! I’m still pursuing that.",3,10
chandler,"How... exactly are you pursuing that? You know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?",3,10
rachel,"Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts.",3,10
joey,"If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.",3,10
rachel,The fear?,3,10
chandler,"He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.",3,10
rachel,"Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?",3,10
chandler,"Because, I’m too afraid.",3,10
rachel,"I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, you know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here.",3,10
chandler,"Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and still working here.",3,10
gunther,Rachel?,3,10
rachel,Yeah.,3,10
gunther,Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.,3,10
rachel,Can’t I just look at the handles on them?,3,10
gunther,You would think.,3,10
rachel,"Okay, fine. Gunther, you know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think I should do it anymore. I’m going to give you my weeks notice.",3,10
gunther,What?!,3,10
rachel,"Gunther, I quit.",3,10
chandler,Does this mean we’re going to have to start paying for coffee?,3,10
ross,"....and 12, 22, 18, four...  What?",3,10
chandler,I spelled out boobies.,3,10
monica,"Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?",3,10
ross,"Ah, we’re out. I sold them all.",3,10
monica,What?,3,10
ross,"Monica, I’m cutting you off.",3,10
monica,"No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it’s no big deal, all right, I’m-I’m cool. You got to help me out with a couple more boxes!",3,10
ross,"Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.",3,10
monica,Oh God!,3,10
chandler,"So, how many have you sold so far?",3,10
ross,Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!,3,10
chandler,"Oh my God, how did you do that?",3,10
ross,"Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me",3,10
rachel,"Okay, stop what you’re doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....",3,10
ross,"Well hey, who did these resumes for you?",3,10
chandler,Me! On my computer.,3,10
ross,Well you sure used a large font.,3,10
chandler,"Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.",3,10
rachel,Hey-hey-hey that’s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You want to know what else is really funny?!,3,10
chandler,Something else I might have said?,3,10
rachel,"I don’t know, I don’t know, weren’t you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!",3,10
ross,"Sweetie, calm down, it’s going to be okay.",3,10
rachel,"No, it’s not going to be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don’t have a lead. Okay, you know what, I’m just going to, I’m just going to call Gunther and I’m going to tell him, I’m not quitting.",3,10
chandler,You-you-you don’t want to give into the fear.,3,10
rachel,You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....,3,10
joey,Hey! I got great news!,3,10
chandler,"Run, Joey! Run for your life!",3,10

joey,Not a problem.,3,10
rachel,Thanks.,3,10
joey,And now for the great news.,3,10
ross,"What, that wasn’t the great news?",3,10
joey,"Only if you think it’s better than this...  snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.",3,10
monica,Christmas cookie?,3,10
joey,"Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it’s a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.",3,10
guy,Looks good. I’ll take it.,3,10
phoebe,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don’t want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.",3,10

joey,"Yeah, the ah, trees that don’t fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.",3,10

monica,"Oh honey, is that because your Mom died around Christmas?",3,10
phoebe,"Oh, I wasn’t even thinking about that.",3,10
monica,Oh.,3,10
ross,"Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?",3,10

ra boss,"Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your going to use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, because this part’s tricky, see some people use filters just once.",3,10
ross,"I’m, I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Space camp, and I’m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle’s Private Very Special Space camp!!",3,10

monica,"He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.",3,11
phoebe,"Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly, please?’",3,11
monica,"I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.",3,11
phoebe,"Ooh, that is silly.  I’ll go up there, I’ll tell him to keep it down.",3,11
monica,"All right, be my guest.",3,11
rachel,Good luck.,3,11
joey,"All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really want to know how I did it, I’ll show you. When you handed me back the card, what you didn’t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye.  I just did it.  I just did it, again. Here, I’ll slow it down so that you guys can see it.",3,11

chandler,I just saw Janice.,3,11

chandler,"Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Centre skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.",3,11
joey,"Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.",3,11
chandler,"Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.",3,11
joey,"Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story you know....",3,11
ross,"Hey Chandler, there’s a party tomorrow, you’ll feel better then.",3,11
chandler,"OH, you know what, I’m going to be okay, you don’t have to throw a party for me.",3,11
monica,It’s Joey’s birthday.,3,11
chandler,"Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.",3,11

rachel,Op.,3,11
mr. kaplan,Eh.,3,11
rachel,"Oh, you got me.",3,11
mr. kaplan,"Well, don’t think I haven’t noticed your potential. Well, I’ve got a project for you that’s a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?",3,11
rachel,"Oh, that sounds great.",3,11
mr. kaplan,"Come on over here, sweetheart.",3,11
rachel,"Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.",3,11
mr. kaplan,I need these hangers separated ASAP.  You’re welcome.,3,11
rachel,"Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.",3,11
monica,"I know honey, I’m sorry.",3,11
rachel,"Oh, I want to quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.",3,11
monica,"Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!",3,11
rachel,"Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t.... I don’t mind paying my dues, you know, its just how much am I going to learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.",3,11
rachel,Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?,3,11
guy,"I’m sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....",3,11
rachel,"It’s not funny, this is actually my job.",3,11

rachel,Do you want my pickle?,3,11
gunther,Hey guys.,3,11
monica,Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean you’re going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?,3,11
phoebe,"Well, he’s very charming.",3,11
monica,"I know, he’s too charming, but if you two start going out, then it’s just going to make it so much harder for me to hate him.",3,11
phoebe,"Well, you’re just going to have to try.",3,11
monica,"Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?",3,11
joey,"I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passing’ ‘them around...",3,11

ross,Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.,3,11
rachel,What!?,3,11
ross,"Well, I’m just saying, I mean why else would he just, you know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.",3,11
rachel,To be nice.,3,11
ross,"Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?",3,11
joey,"No, only for sex.",3,11
ross,"Thank you.  So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?",3,11

chandler,"Oh, I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialler.",3,11
j sisters,Oh!!,3,11
chandler,"No-no-no-no, no, it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savour the precious moments?  Those are some huge breasts you have.",3,11

ross,"Oh yeah! So ah, kind of pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.",3,11
monica,"Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, you know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, ‘Hummina-hummina-hummina.’",3,11
ross,That’s excellent.,3,11
ross,"So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?",3,11
rachel,"Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but you know, that’s true of any job.",3,11
monica,How you feeling’?,3,11
chandler,"Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.",3,11
phoebe,Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.,3,11

monica,That’s okay.,3,11
rachel,That’s all right.,3,11
ross,That’s okay.,3,11
joey,Can I talk to you for a second?!,3,11

joey,Yeah.,3,11
monica,You know which one was she again?,3,11
joey,"Why don’t you ask Chandler, because he’s the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just getting’ over Janice by groping my sister.",3,11
chandler,It’s got to be the first one.,3,11
joey,"Really? That’s great! You and my sister, sitting’ in a tree.",3,11

rachel,"Yeah, I do.",3,11
ross,Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter I’ve ever had to write.  What the hell’s a matter with you? How do you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?,3,11
chandler,"Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.",3,11
ross,"All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.",3,11
chandler,What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?,3,11

chandler,"Joey, what-wh-wh-what-wh-what-wh-what-wh-what-what are you doing here?",3,11
joey,Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?,3,11
chandler,I’m here to see Mary-Angela.,3,11
joey,"You are so the man!  Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, because my Grandma doesn’t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.",3,11
chandler,Where’s Mary-Angela?,3,11
joey,She’s right in there.,3,11
j sisters,"Hey, Chandler!",3,11

ross,Bummer.,3,11
rachel,"Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.",3,11
ross,"No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.",3,11
monica,"Wait a minute, why don’t you just call Mark.  I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to make stuff happen.",3,11
ross,"But, you, you don’t want to seem too pushy.",3,11
monica,"Honey, it’s not pushy, he gave her his home number.",3,11
ross,"What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?",3,11
rachel,"Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.",3,11
ross,"That’s right good things, that-that is what I said.",3,11
rachel,"Hello, Mark? Hi, it’s Rachel Green.  Oh no, don’t you apologize.  Yeah, I’ll hold.  He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.",3,11

rachel,"Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later.  Woo hoo!",3,11
ross,You go get ‘them.  What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?,3,11
monica,What?,3,11
ross,"‘Why don’t you call him?!’ Well, thank you very much! You know now he is going to prep her, you know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!",3,11
monica,Are you crazy?!,3,11
ross,Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.,3,11
monica,"What?! Ross you know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’re right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?",3,11
ross,No.,3,11
monica,I mean don’t you trust her?,3,11
ross,"Well, yeah!",3,11
monica,Then get over yourself! Grow up!,3,11

j sisters,Just do it.,3,11
chandler,Will you excuse me I have to um.....,3,11
chandler,Hey!,3,11
j sisters,"Finally, I thought we’d never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.",3,11
chandler,"Look, I may have jumped the gun here.  Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.",3,11
j sisters,"So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.",3,11
chandler,"Ah, you’re not Mary-Angela.",3,11

joey,What’s going’ on?,3,11
chandler,You’re it! Now run and hide!,3,11
mary-theresa,It’s no big deal. Chandler was just kissing’ me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.,3,11
joey,"What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?",3,11
chandler,"I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was.  Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.",3,11
j sisters,"I say, punch him Joey.",3,11
all,Yeah! Punch him!!,3,11
chandler,"You know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me.  Are you?",3,11
joey,"Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!",3,11
chandler,"Joey if you want to punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.",3,11
cookie,"So what. I say, punch him.",3,11
all,Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!,3,11
joey,"No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler.",3,11
cookie,I’ll do it.,3,11

chandler,"Okay, absolutely!",3,11

rachel,"Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.",3,11
phoebe,"Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.",3,11
ross,Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?,3,11
ross,Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?,3,11
joey,"All right, that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe.  This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime!  But, is he a big guy?",3,11
ross,"Ah, we’ll all go.  Come on.",3,11
phoebe,Thanks you guys! Thank you.,3,11
chandler,Don’t worry.,3,11
phoebe,"God, I hope they kick his ass!",3,11
rachel,"Honey, I’m sorry.",3,11
monica,"You know if it’s any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.",3,11
guy,May I help you?,3,11
rachel,Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?,3,12
chandler,"Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's going to focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.",3,12
rachel,Tell him.,3,12
ross,It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!,3,12
chandler,"All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?",3,12

ross,"Hmm? Oh, yeah.",3,12
phoebe,"Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!",3,12
chandler,It must take you forever to find your keys.,3,12
rachel,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.",3,12
phoebe,"Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.",3,12
rachel,"No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.",3,12
ross,"Honey, just relax, it's going to be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?",3,12
rachel,"Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.",3,12
ross,"Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?",3,12
rachel,"Yeah, it's kind of like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing.  Is this actually a lunchbox?",3,12
phoebe,"Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.",3,12
rachel,Oh.,3,12
chandler,"Hey, so can you make it on Friday?",3,12
ross,"What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?",3,12
chandler,Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.,3,12
phoebe,"A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliche. Why don't you get a magician?!",3,12
chandler,"Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.",3,12
ross,"She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and,  he's really good looking.  What am I going to do?",3,12
chandler,Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!  Don't cry out loud.,3,12

ross,I would never do that!,3,12
rachel,"Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.",3,12
ross,"Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.",3,12
joey,Mark's a genius!,3,12
ross,Why?! How?! How is he a genius?,3,12
chandler,"Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's going to be the guy she goes too to complain about you.",3,12

chandler,"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you are going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.",3,12
ross,I don't know you guys.,3,12
chandler,"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'",3,12
joey,"And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'OH, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'

monica,What do you mean?,3,12
phoebe,Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.,3,12
monica,"So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?",3,12
julio,What?,3,12
monica,"You know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And you know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. you know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.",3,12
julio,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.",3,12
monica,You don't even know me...,3,12
julio,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.",3,12
monica,What?,3,12
julio,"The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.",3,12
monica,"I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...",3,12
julio,"No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?",3,12
monica,Oh yeah.,3,12
director,"All right, let's do it!",3,12

rachel,A big idiot.,3,12
ross,"A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kind of hard for me.",3,12
rachel,"Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?",3,12
ross,"Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not going to, well that someone else is not going to take you away.",3,12
gunther,Let it be me! Let it be me!,3,12
rachel,"Honey, that is very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.",3,12
ross,I got to get going. Bye Chandler.,3,12
chandler,"Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kind of getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?",3,12
rachel,Where you going?,3,12
ross,"Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.",3,12

rachel,You have a play date with a stripper?!,3,12
chandler,"Man, I got to get a kid.",3,12
ross,"Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she you know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?",3,12
rachel,"Sure, is she married?",3,12
ross,"Ahh, no.",3,12
rachel,Oh.,3,12
ross,Are you jealous?,3,12
rachel,"No, I you know I don't see why she has to play with you, that is all. I mean doesn't she have any you know other stripper moms friends of her own?",3,12
ross,You are totally jealous.,3,12
rachel,"I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things you know about strippers. And you know, and um, I...",3,12
ross,"Honey, I love you too.",3,12
rachel,"Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.",3,12
ross,What?,3,12
ross,Huh.,3,12
rachel,"Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, you know.",3,12
chandler,"Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.",3,12
man,Is there a Julio here?,3,12
julio,I am Julio.,3,12
man,"Mister Pretensous,  you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.",3,12

monica,Right.,3,13
richard,No you do. You... just...,3,13
monica,What?,3,13
richard,You’ve got panties stuck to your leg.,3,13
monica,"That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d be running into you and saw an opportunity.",3,13
richard,It’s good to see you.,3,13
monica,It’s good to see you too.,3,13
monica,"You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but you know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the porn.",3,13

rachel,Oh I don’t know honey. It’s going to be really late.,3,13
ross,"Oh come on, not again.",3,13
rachel,"I know. I’m sorry. Look, I’ll make a deal with you all right? Okay?",3,13
ross,Hmm.,3,13
rachel,For every night that you’re asleep before I get home from work...,3,13
ross,Yeah.,3,13

rachel,Right.,3,13
phoebe,Hi.,3,13
all,Hey.,3,13
joey,Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?,3,13

ross,And what are you going to do for him?,3,13
phoebe,I’m going to let him.,3,13

monica,"Yeah well, I ran into Richard.",3,13
rachel,When did this happen?,3,13
monica,"Oh, um, around 8",3,13
phoebe,"Oh, there’s no such thing as an innocent burger.",3,13
ross,"So, are you going to see him again?",3,13
monica,Tomorrow night.,3,13
rachel,"Monica, what are you doing?",3,13
chandler,"Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.",3,13
monica,"It’s not a date, okay. I’m just going to teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.",3,13
joey,"Well, you might want to make a little extra, you know you’ll probably be hungry after the sex.",3,13
monica,"We’re not going to have sex! Okay, nothing’s changed here. He still doesn’t want children and I still do, so that’s why we’re just going to be friends.",3,13
ross,Naked friends.,3,13
rachel,Hey.,3,13
joey,Hey.,3,13
rachel,Do you have any ice?,3,13
joey,"Check the freezer. If there’s none in there, then we’re probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late.",3,13
rachel,"Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?",3,13
joey,I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.,3,13
rachel,"Hmm.  Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?",3,13
joey,"Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.",3,13
rachel,"But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?",3,13
joey,"Well, safer. You know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, you know.",3,13
rachel,How often do you read it?,3,13
joey,Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?,3,13
rachel,"Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?",3,13
joey,"The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be",3,13
rachel,"Okay. Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining,  and you will read Little Women.",3,13
joey,"All right, you got it.",3,13
rachel,All right.,3,13

chandler,"Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.",3,13
chandler,"I’m up! I’m up, I’ve gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?",3,13
phoebe,I’ll have coffee.,3,13
robert,"Yeah, me too.",3,13
ross,"Yeah, make that three.",3,13
chandler,"Okay Ross, why don’t you come with me?",3,13
ross,"Okay.   What ah, what is the matter with you? What’s going on?",3,13
chandler,Robert’s coming out.,3,13

chandler,Well?,3,13
ross,"Yeah, yeah, yeah!",3,13
chandler,What do we do? What do we do?,3,13
ross,"Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.",3,13
chandler,Like an eclipse.,3,13
richard,"So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?",3,13
monica,"You say ‘Thank you very much,’ and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we’re going to put are hands in this bowl, and we’re going to start squishing the tomatoes.",3,13
richard,"Ew, this feels very weird.",3,13
monica,You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.,3,13
richard,"Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them.  That’s my hand.",3,13
monica,Oops.,3,13
richard,Okay.,3,13
monica,got to keep squishing.,3,13
richard,Tomatoes are squishing.,3,13
monica,Okay.,3,13
richard,Op.,3,13

joey,Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo’s manuscript. I don’t see how he could ever forgive her.,3,13
ross,"Umm, Jo’s a girl, it’s short for Josephine.",3,13
joey,But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie.  Oh. You mean it’s like a girl-girl thing? Because that is the one thing missing from The Shining.,3,13
chandler,"No, actually Laurie’s a boy.",3,13
joey,No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.,3,13
phoebe,Hey!,3,13
chandler,Hey.,3,13
ross,"Hey! How’d the ah, basketball go?",3,13
phoebe,"Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.",3,13

phoebe,"Oh, I get more because I’m dainty.",3,13
robert,"So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?",3,13

ross,Calm down. There’s no reason to get testy.,3,13
phoebe,You guys!! Come on!,3,13

phoebe,What do you mean?,3,13
robert,Hey.,3,13
phoebe,Hey.,3,13
joey,"Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?",3,13
robert,Sure.,3,13
monica,"So, how’d the lasagne go over?  Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things.  Yeah, I’ve been thinking a lot about you too.  I know. It’s hard this whole platonic thing.  It’s a word!",3,13
monica,"Yeah, I do think it’s better this way.  Yeah, we’re being smart.   Yes, I’m sure.",3,13
richard,You really sure?,3,13
monica,I’ll call you back.,3,13
monica,So we can be friends who sleep together.,3,13
richard,"Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.",3,13
monica,"Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?",3,13
richard,Just your dad.  Although that’s actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister’s neighbour next Tuesday.,3,13
monica,Oh.,3,13
richard,You want me to cancel it?,3,13
monica,No!  No!,3,13
richard,Okay.,3,13

richard,Exactly.,3,13
robert,Hey.,3,13
phoebe,Hey. Ooh! Don’t sit down!,3,13

phoebe,"Yeah. And, first here’s a gift.",3,13
robert,Oh! Wow! Hey!,3,13
chandler,"Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!",3,13
robert,"Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don’t think I can wear these, they’re so tight, I feel like I’m on display. I’m sorry.",3,13
phoebe,"That’s all right, that’s well, I figured....",3,13

rachel,"Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you’re going to ruin it!",3,13
joey,All right I’ll talk in code.  Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?,3,13
chandler,"Hmmm, that’s very cool.",3,13
joey,"Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!",3,13
rachel,Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!,3,13
chandler,I can’t believe she cracked your code!,3,13
rachel,"All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.",3,13
joey,"Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.",3,13
rachel,Eh. Beth dies.,3,13
joey,"Beth, Beth dies?",3,13
rachel,Um-hmm.,3,13
joey,Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth going to die?,3,13
chandler,"No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?",3,13
rachel,What?!,3,13
ross,Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?,3,13
rachel,No. She doesn’t die.,3,13
joey,Then why would you say that?!,3,13
rachel,"Because, I wanted to hurt you.",3,13
robert,"Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.",3,13
rachel,Oh my....,3,13
robert,Got them.,3,13
monica,Hi.,3,13
rachel,Sorry. I’m sorry.,3,13

monica,What are you smiling at?,3,13
rachel,"I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.",3,13
monica,"Yeah, right.",3,13
richard,Hello.,3,13

phoebe,"Listen, Robert’s going to be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?",3,13
ross,Oh.,3,13
phoebe,"Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’",3,13
chandler,"We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.",3,13
ross,"He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary.",3,13
robert,Hey!,3,13
phoebe,Hey.,3,13
robert,"So are ready for the gym? They’ve got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.",3,13
phoebe,"No, I can spot you from here.",3,13

ross,"Hey, don’t we have to...",3,13
chandler,"Yeah, we got, um-hmm.",3,13
phoebe,"Umm, I think you’re really, really great...",3,13
robert,Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me?  Is it something I’m putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?,3,13
phoebe,"I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say.",3,13
gunther,"Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.",3,13
monica,Ow!,3,13
richard,"Really?! Well, it’s just like everyone else’s apartment. It’s got rooms, walls, and ceilings.",3,13
ric date,"Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.",3,13
monica,Oh my God! Oh my God!,3,13

ric date,We’re still on this side of the door.,3,13
richard,Um-hmm.,3,13
ric date,"Yeah, but I didn’t get to see it.",3,13
richard,Oh shoot! Maybe next time.  Thanks for a lovely evening.,3,13
monica,"So um, who was she?",3,13
richard,"Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.",3,13
monica,"Did you like her? And I’m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.",3,13
richard,"Well, you seem fine.",3,13
monica,"Okay,you know what, I’m not fine, I’m not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... you know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?",3,13
richard,You mean like exclusive friends?,3,13
monica,"Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.",3,13
richard,"Wow.you know we’re back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing’s changed.",3,13
monica,"That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache.",3,13
richard,"Okay, okay, one thing’s changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is going to end.",3,13
monica,"You know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I could do it again.",3,13
richard,I know I couldn’t. So....,3,13
monica,How ‘bout one last game of racquetball?,3,13

monica,"Yeah, sure.",3,14

monica,"No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said,  ‘the movie star.’",3,14

joey,"All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....",3,14
monica,You gave her food poisoning!?,3,14
joey,"I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.",3,14
phoebe,Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!,3,14
joey,"I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kind of has a ah, artificial leg.",3,14
monica,"Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?",3,14
joey,I ran!!,3,14
chandler,"Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.",3,14

ross,"Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...",3,14
rachel,"Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?",3,14
ross,Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?,3,14

monica,"Okay, well I do know you.",3,14
phoebe,That’s what I said.,3,14
monica,Well so?,3,14
phoebe,"I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone. You know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.",3,14
leslie,"My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don’t care what people say. My feet’s best friends, pals to the end. With them I’m one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....",3,14

leslie,"Wow, that’s great.",3,14

phoebe,"I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.",3,14
leslie,What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.,3,14
phoebe,"Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by now, you know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.",3,14

chandler,"Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it did.

I’m the smallest person in the world.",3,14
joey,Morning.,3,14
chandler,Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.,3,14

ross,Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.,3,14
rachel,"Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’",3,14
ross,"First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.",3,14

rachel,"You know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?",3,14
ross,"No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I feel like you’re slipping away from me, you know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but I hate that I’m not a part of it.",3,14
rachel,"It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. you know what I mean?  I mean it’s like, I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.",3,14
ross,That’s a little clearer.,3,14
rachel,"Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me you know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?",3,14
ross,"Sure, I-I-I...",3,14

chandler,No. No. I don’t think so.,3,14
ginger,"Okay. It’s just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.",3,14

leslie,"I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.",3,14
phoebe,"No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, you know what, I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.",3,14
leslie,"No, no, I don’t want to forget it.",3,14
phoebe,"Okay you know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won’t be partners. So what’s it going to be?",3,14

ross,Hi!,3,15
rachel,"Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?",3,15
ross,Well you said you couldn’t go out so....,3,15
sophie,"You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That’s it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.",3,15
rachel,"Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.",3,15
ross,"Yeah, but I got cous-cous!",3,15
rachel,"Honey, honey, I’m sorry, I know it’s our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don’t have time to stop.",3,15
ross,"Okay, you don’t have to stop, I’m invisible, I’m not here.",3,15
rachel,"But I don’t, hmm...  Oh, who approved that order?!  Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office.  Get me Mark on the phone!",3,15
sophie,I love Mark.  Do you know Mark?,3,15
ross,Yeah!!,3,15
rachel,"Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for  this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...",3,15
ross,Pepper?,3,15
rachel,None for me.,3,15
ross,"Okay sorry, whew.",3,15
rachel,"I’m sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I’m sorry but that’s...  Oh my God!!",3,15
ross,"Okay, that’s a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.",3,15
rachel,"Excuse me, I’m sorry, I’m going to have to call you back, I’ve got a Schemp in my office.   What are you doing?",3,15
ross,"I’m sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody’s off the phone, how ‘bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.",3,15
rachel,"Ross you’re not listening to me, I don’t have time to stop.",3,15
ross,"Come on Rach, you don’t have what, ten minutes?",3,15
rachel,I don’t have ten minutes!!,3,15
ross,"What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?",3,15
rachel,"Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don’t!",3,15
ross,"Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week.",3,15

ross,Hey.,3,15
rachel,"Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...",3,15
ross,"No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.",3,15
rachel,I was going to give you a chance to apologise to me.,3,15
ross,For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?,3,15
rachel,You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!,3,15
ross,"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.",3,15
rachel,"But I told you, I didn’t have the time!",3,15
ross,"Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.",3,15
rachel,"Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?",3,15
ross,"No, but it’d be nice if you realised, it’s just a job!",3,15
rachel,Just a job!,3,15
ross,Yes.,3,15
rachel,Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...,3,15
ross,"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for you, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.",3,15
rachel,Well neither do I!,3,15
ross,Is this about Mark?,3,15
rachel,Oh my God.,3,15
ross,"Okay, it’s not, it’s not.",3,15
rachel,"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.",3,15
ross,"Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.",3,15
rachel,"I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.",3,15
ross,"Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break,  let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogurt, or something..",3,15
rachel,No.  A break from us.,3,15
chloe,"And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000,you know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.",3,15
chloe,"Hey, it’s the dinosaur guy.  Hi, Ross.",3,15
ross,"Oh, hi Chloe.",3,15
chloe,"I want you to met some friends of mine.  This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don’t do that, and he says you got to. And you know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say ‘let’s Ross it!’",3,15
chandler,And that’s the only colour that comes in.,3,15
issac,"Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?",3,15
chloe,Oh!,3,15
chandler,"So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.",3,15
ross,"Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we’re going to break-up instead.",3,15
monica,"Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?",3,15
mischa,"Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.",3,15
monica,Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.,3,15
phoebe,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.",3,15
phoebe,You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.,3,15
mischa,Boutros Boutros Gali.,3,15
mischa,He says he was too.,3,15
phoebe,Interesting.,3,15
mischa,So I was wondering....,3,15
phoebe,"Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.",3,15
mischa,"Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.  So you are a chef?",3,15
monica,I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.,3,15
mischa,"Oh, really.",3,15
phoebe,"Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?",3,15
monica,"Well, I was having a conversation.",3,15
phoebe,"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.",3,15
monica,What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?,3,15
phoebe,That would be great. Thank you.,3,15
rachel,Hello!,3,15
mark,"Oh, hi. It’s Mark.",3,15
rachel,Oh.,3,15
mark,What? Is it my breath?,3,15
rachel,"No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!",3,15
mark,"Hi. Well, look, I was just going to leave a message, isn’t tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?",3,15
rachel,"Yeah. Well, umm.....",3,15
mark,"Rach, are you okay?",3,15
rachel,"Yeah, I’m fine.",3,15
mark,"You want to talk, I mean I can come over?",3,15
rachel,"No! Really, no, please, please, that’s, that’s okay.",3,15
mark,"All right, all right, I’m coming over, and I’m bringing Chinese food.",3,15
rachel,"Oh, yeah, I’m not, I’m not hungry.",3,15
mark,It’s for me.,3,15
rachel,"Oh. Okay, bye.",3,15
joey,So what are you going to do?,3,15
ross,"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.",3,15
chandler,"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",3,15
ross,"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to wait a while?",3,15
chandler,"Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",3,15
chandler,You know that whole swimming thing is a myth.,3,15
joey,"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.",3,15
chandler,Why? What happened to him?,3,15
joey,"Nothing, he’s just really believes in that.",3,15
rachel,"Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",3,15
mark,Wow. I’m sorry. Eggroll?,3,15
rachel,"No.  And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.",3,15
mark,"Well, then he’s, he’s probably just, out.",3,15
rachel,"Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.",3,15
rachel,Hello.,3,15
ross,Hi! It’s me.,3,15
rachel,"Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called.",3,15
ross,"Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",3,15
mark,"Hey, what do you want to drink?",3,15
ross,Who’s that?,3,15
rachel,Nobody.,3,15
mark,Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?,3,15
ross,Is that Mark?,3,15
rachel,"Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",3,15
ross,Yeah! Got it!,3,15
chloe,"Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.",3,15
ross,"Ah, that’s okay, thanks.",3,15
chloe,"Hey, you don’t have to smile. You just have to dance.",3,15
ross,"Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?",3,15
chloe,"Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.",3,15
mischa,"And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.",3,15
monica,Oh.  Can I have a tissue?,3,15
phoebe,"Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.",3,15
mischa,"Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.",3,15
phoebe,"Well, tell him, apology accepted.",3,15
mischa,"Oh, he’s unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!!  You silly diplomat, why don’t you learn some English, Sergei?",3,15
phoebe,"Excuse me, but umm, isn’t he paying for your dinner?",3,15
monica,"Hey, the man’s dog just died.",3,15
mischa,I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.,3,15
monica,It will be my pleasure.  My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can’t even say coupons.,3,15
sergei,"Uh,  plate?",3,15

sergei,Plate. Plate. Plate.,3,15
phoebe,"See, we don’t need them.",3,15
sergei,Plate?,3,15

chloe,"Well, you’re practically dancing already. Why don’t you just do it over here?",3,15
ross,"Oh, no, no.",3,15
chloe,What? Are you married? because that’s okay.,3,15
rachel,"Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you’re not home.",3,15
chloe,Still no smile?,3,15
sergei,"Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie.  Ameri-ccan.",3,15

rachel,"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.",3,16

rachel,No. A break from us.,3,16
rachel,"Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",3,16
ross,"I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",3,16
mark,"Hey, what do you want to drink?",3,16

rachel,"God, Monica it’s on the ceiling.",3,16
monica,"That’s okay, this is more important than fruit   on my ceiling! You broke up?!",3,16

monica,Oh no!!,3,16
rachel,No.,3,16
monica,"Rachel, you and Mark?!",3,16
rachel,"No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.",3,16
chloe,Morning!,3,16
rachel,"Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you got to know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.",3,16
ross,Yeah!!,3,16
rachel,"Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I you know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine.",3,16
ross,Na-huh.,3,16
rachel,"So, I love you.",3,16
ross,I love you.,3,16

chloe,You must be so happy!,3,16
ross,"Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I’m feeling. Well....",3,16

rachel,So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?,3,16
ross,"Yes, you can, very much.",3,16
ross,Ah!!,3,16
phoebe,Hey!,3,16
monica,Hey.,3,16
phoebe,"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?",3,16
monica,"Oh, there’s banana on it.",3,16
phoebe,"Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.",3,16
monica,So then you know?,3,16
phoebe,"The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.",3,16
monica,"Oh, good. Thanks.",3,16
phoebe,Now what is Fabutec?,3,16
monica,"Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....",3,16
phoebe,Waxine!!,3,16
monica,Yes! Have you seen it?,3,16
phoebe,"Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.",3,16
monica,I know!!,3,16
phoebe,God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? Because how can they do that?,3,16
monica,Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!,3,16
phoebe,They have the best stuff in there.,3,16
chandler,Oh my God! Oh my God!,3,16
joey,"Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you should have done. Huh?",3,16
ross,"You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I going to do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she going to do? What is she going to say?’ when I tell her what I did.",3,16
chandler,"Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?",3,16
ross,"What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?",3,16
joey,"Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s going to get you in trouble.",3,16
chandler,"He’s right. Nobody’s going to benefit, and you’re just going to hurt her.",3,16
joey,"Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.",3,16
ross,"Yeah, but don’t you think....",3,16
chandler,"All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.",3,16
ross,"Yeah, okay.",3,16
joey,"All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail?",3,16
ross,What trail?,3,16
joey,The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!  You always have to think about the trail!,3,16
ross,"Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail.",3,16
chandler,"Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!",3,16
phoebe,"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,",3,16
monica,Did that!,3,16
phoebe,Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.,3,16
monica,Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!,3,16
phoebe,Was it not pain-free?,3,16
monica,"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.",3,16
phoebe,"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.",3,16
monica,"That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, you know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.",3,16
phoebe,Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!,3,16
monica,"Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?",3,16
ross,Chloe? Hi..,3,16
chloe,Is this about me taking your watch?,3,16
ross,You took my watch?,3,16
chloe,"I’m sorry, I do that.",3,16
ross,"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",3,16
chloe,"Oh no. I feel it isn’t really anybody’s business, you know.",3,16
ross,"Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?",3,16
chloe,"Oh, well I tell Issac everything.",3,16
ross,"You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, HI! You know we haven’t actually met...",3,16
issac,You dog!,3,16
ross,"Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.",3,16
issac,"Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.",3,16
ross,"Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.",3,16
issac,"Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love them, monogamy is too cruel a rule.",3,16
ross,"Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?",3,16
issac,"Aw, no problem dude. You know we got to look out for each other. We’re the same, you and me.",3,16
ross,"Actually, no, we’re not.",3,16
issac,"Yeah, we are.",3,16
ross,"No, we’re not.",3,16
issac,"Yeah, we are.",3,16
ross,"No, we’re not!!",3,16
issac,"Okay, we’re not.",3,16
ross,Right.,3,16
issac,"But, we are.",3,16
ross,Fine. I just need to know that you’re not going to tell your sister.,3,16
issac,I can promise not to tell her again.,3,16
ross,Jasmine?,3,16
jasmine,Uh-huh.,3,16
ross,"We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.",3,16
jasmine,You did a bad thing!,3,16
ross,"Yes, I did.",3,16
jasmine,Very bad!,3,16
ross,Very bad.,3,16
jasmine,"Very, very bad.",3,16
ross,"I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?",3,16
jasmine,No.,3,16
ross,"Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?",3,16
jasmine,All right.,3,16
ross,"Thank you, thank you.",3,16
jasmine,"But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.",3,16
ross,Who’s your roommate?,3,16
ross,"Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.",3,16
gunther,I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to?,3,16
monica,Ow!,3,16
phoebe,Oh!!,3,16
monica,Ow!! Ow!!,3,16
phoebe,Ow!!!,3,16
monica and phoebe,Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!,3,16
phoebe,We’re all right.,3,16
monica,"It’s okay, it’s okay.",3,16
phoebe,We’re all right.,3,16
monica,We were just waxing our legs.,3,16
chandler,Off?!!,3,16
phoebe,"For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.",3,16
chandler,"Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.",3,16
joey,"Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.",3,16
phoebe,"Oh yeah, come here.",3,16
chandler,"Oh, that’s mature.",3,16
joey,"Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?",3,16
phoebe,Uh-huh.,3,16
monica,That’s right.,3,16
ross,"Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!",3,16
rachel,I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!,3,16
monica,What?,3,16
chandler,"Nothing, nothing.",3,16
monica,Rachel said everything was okay.,3,16
phoebe,"What, what are they talking about?",3,16
ross,Rachel?,3,16
rachel,Just get away from me!,3,16
ross,"No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?",3,16
rachel,A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!,3,16
phoebe,Where-where did he put it?!,3,16
rachel,"Ross, you had sex with another woman!",3,16
monica,Oh my God.,3,16
phoebe,"Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.",3,16
chandler,"Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....",3,16
monica,Oh!!  You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!,3,16
chandler,"He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.",3,16
rachel,"You know what, I want you to leave! Get out of here!",3,16
ross,No!!,3,16
rachel,Just get out! Now!!,3,16
ross,No!! No!! I want to stay. I want to talk about this.,3,16
rachel,Okay! All right! How was she?,3,16
chandler,Uh-oh.,3,16
ross,What?,3,16
rachel,Was she good?,3,16
joey,Don’t answer that.,3,16
rachel,"Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?",3,16
ross,She was...,3,16
joey,Awful! Horrible!,3,16
chandler,She was not good. Not good.,3,16
joey,She was nothing compared to you.,3,16
ross,"She, she was different.",3,16
joey,Eww!,3,16
chandler,Uh-oh.,3,16
rachel,Good different?,3,16
ross,Nobody likes change.,3,16
ross,"What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.",3,16
phoebe,Should we do something?,3,16
chandler,"Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.",3,16
ross,"I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.",3,16
rachel,"Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave?  Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!",3,16
ross,"Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!",3,16
rachel,And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!,3,16
ross,"Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.",3,16
rachel,We were on a break!,3,16
ross,"That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.",3,16
rachel,You think you’re going to get out of this on a technicality?,3,16
ross,"Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!",3,16
rachel,"Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!",3,16
joey,"You know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore.",3,16
monica,"What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there.",3,16
joey,Why not?!  I’m hungry.,3,16
monica,Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.,3,16
rachel,God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!,3,16
ross,"Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!",3,16
rachel,"Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.",3,16
chandler,"You know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.",3,16
joey,"Yeah, we’ll be fine.",3,16
ross,"Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.",3,16
chandler,"Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever.",3,16
phoebe,"Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s going to have to take my 9",3,16
ross,Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?,3,16
rachel,All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?,3,16
ross,Yes I would.,3,16
rachel,"You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?",3,16
ross,Yes.,3,16
rachel,"You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....",3,16
ross,"La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it’s, I mean it’s you.",3,16
all,oh!,3,16
ross,"What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?",3,16
rachel,"I’m thinking, I’m going to order a pizza.",3,16
ross,"Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’",3,16
joey,"Oh man, pizza? I like pizza.  Put olives on the pizza.",3,16
phoebe,We could eat the wax! It’s organic.,3,16
chandler,"Oh great, food with hair on it.",3,16
phoebe,"No, not the used wax.",3,16
chandler,Because that would be crazy?,3,16
ross,"Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kind of hungry myself.",3,16
rachel,"Fine.  Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza.",3,16
ross,No anchovies.,3,16
rachel,"With ah, extra anchovies.",3,16
ross,"That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘them off.",3,16
rachel,"Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?",3,16
ross,"You can have the last piece, if you want.",3,16
rachel,"Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.",3,16
phoebe,"They’re going to get through this, aren’t they?",3,16
chandler,"Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too.",3,16
monica,What if they don’t?,3,16
joey,You think I need a new walk?,3,16
chandler,What?,3,16
joey,"Well you know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. You know, you know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk.",3,16
chandler,Are you actually saying these words?,3,16
ross,"What, now you’re not even taking to me?  Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey!",3,16
joey,"Whoa-ho-ho!  Yeah, okay.",3,16
monica,Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.,3,16
phoebe,"Yeah, you know, people can be so self-involved.",3,16
ross,"You know what, you know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!",3,16
rachel,That’s....,3,16
ross,That’s what?!,3,16
rachel,That is neither here nor there.,3,16
ross,"Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you want to fight for us? Or, do you want to bail?  Look, I,  I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t.  I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.",3,16
rachel,"No Ross!!  Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re going to make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?",3,16
ross,"Okay, okay, okay.",3,16
rachel,I think you should go.,3,16
ross,What?,3,16
rachel,I really think you need to go now.,3,16
ross,"Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...",3,16
rachel,"Yeah, what the hell did I know!",3,16
ross,"Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,  I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you.  Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach,  and, and....",3,16
rachel,"No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t,  it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever.",3,16
ross,"Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.",3,16
rachel,Then how come it is?,3,16
phoebe,They’ve been quiet for a long time.,3,16
joey,Maybe she killed him?,3,16
chandler,Let’s go.,3,16
chandler,Is that your new walk?,3,16
joey,"No, I really have to pee.",3,16
joey,Can I see the comics?,3,17
chandler,This is the New York Times.,3,17
joey,"Okay, may I see the comics?",3,17
monica,Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?,3,17
chandler,We are. He’s meeting us here.,3,17
monica,No! Rachel is meeting us here.,3,17
phoebe,"Oh come on, they can be in the same room.",3,17
joey,"Yeah, you should have been there last night.",3,17
phoebe,Why? What happened now?,3,17
joey,"Well Ross was hanging’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....",3,17
chandler,"Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.",3,17
joey,Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.,3,17
phoebe,Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.,3,17
joey,"Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.",3,17
phoebe,"Whoa!! He is so unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then you know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.",3,17
chandler,"You know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.",3,17
phoebe,"You know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....",3,17
joey,I had the same dream!,3,17
phoebe,"Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.",3,17
joey,"Oh, I had the opposite dream.",3,17
chandler,"You know what maybe it’s going to be okay, I mean it’s been a week.",3,17
joey,"Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.",3,17
monica,It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.,3,17
monica,"Okay, let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!!",3,17
rachel,Hey!,3,17
monica,Let’s get the show on it!,3,17
rachel,"Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.",3,17
monica,"Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s so close.",3,17
rachel,Closer than here?,3,17
phoebe,"Oh, hey, look, I found coffee!  Okay, let’s skedaddle.",3,17
rachel,"Wait, I’m not just going to drink somebody’s old coffee.",3,17
phoebe,"Okay, your highness.",3,17
phoebe,"Um, Rachel I’m really sorry.  That’s okay, do you want to get back together?  Yeah, okay.  Did anyone else hear that?!",3,17
rachel,Is he here?,3,17

rachel,OH!,3,17
monica,We’re sorry honey.,3,17
rachel,"Oh, it’s okay.",3,17
joey,"Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to, really.  Are we talking models in their underwear?",3,17
rachel,And heels.,3,17
joey,"Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.",3,17
rachel,"No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that’s only fair.",3,17
phoebe,"oh boy, do I feel bad.",3,17
joey,Oh yeah.,3,17
monica,Very bad.,3,17
phoebe,Chandler what are you doing?!,3,17

ross,"Look, you guys I just want to say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just want to say thanks.",3,17
chandler,Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.,3,17
ross,"Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think?  Two days of darts, it’ll be great!",3,17

ross,"Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?",3,17
carol,It’s not that kind of anniversary.,3,17
ross,Ah!  Oh.,3,17
carol,So!! Anyway...,3,17
ross,"Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. Because you know love lasts forever, you know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.",3,17
carol,"Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.",3,17
ross,"Yeah, well.",3,17
carol,"You know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?",3,17
ross,"Oh yeah, I’d love that.",3,17
carol,"Oh, great! Me too.",3,17
ross,I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.,3,17
phoebe,"Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.",3,17
rachel,Great!,3,17
phoebe,"Yeah, what town are we near?",3,17

phoebe,Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?,3,17
rachel,"Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.",3,17
phoebe,"Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?",3,17
rachel,"I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.",3,17
phoebe,"Okay.  Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?  Okay!  Yeah, no they don’t do that.",3,17
rachel,"Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.",3,17
monica,"Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.",3,17
rachel,"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!",3,17
phoebe,But if...,3,17
rachel,"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.",3,17
phoebe,"Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.",3,17
monica,So the going for help went well?,3,17
joey,"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.",3,17
chandler,I have the lung capacity of a two year old.,3,17
monica,Then why are you smoking?,3,17
chandler,Well it’s very unsettling.,3,17
ross,"....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable you know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. You know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.",3,17
carol,"Ah, Susan will be so pleased.",3,17
ross,"717?  Where’s 717?  Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?",3,17
carol,"No. But it’s okay, I’ll just put out pickles or something.",3,17
phoebe,"Ross, thank God.",3,17
ross,"Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?",3,17
phoebe,I ate a bug.,3,17
monica,"Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let’s stock up.",3,17
phoebe,"Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck.",3,17
ross,"Oh, now you want a favour?",3,17
phoebe,"Yes, please.",3,17
ross,"Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?",3,17
carol,"Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.",3,17
ross,"No, I’m not going to pick them up.",3,17
carol,"Listen, we both know you’re going to do it because you’re not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.",3,17
ross,"No, Rachel doesn’t want me to....",3,17
carol,"Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you because she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.",3,17
ross,"Yeah, you’re right.",3,17
carol,Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something.  What?   You slept with someone else?!,3,17
ross,"We were on a break!!! Okay!!  We were, we were...,  yeah. Where are you? I’ll find you.",3,17
carol,You slept with another woman?,3,17
ross,"Oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk.",3,17
joey,"Okay, done.",3,17
monica,What’s ‘pleh’?,3,17
joey,That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!,3,17
monica,Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards?,3,17
rachel,"Op, op, car! Car!!  Ugh!!!",3,17
phoebe,"Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives!",3,17
chandler and joey,Hey!!,3,17
phoebe,Hi!,3,17
rachel,What is he doing here?!,3,17
ross,"He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.",3,17
all,No! Come on!,3,17

rachel,"Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.",3,18
ross,"Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.",3,18
rachel,"Oh right, because you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.",3,18

phoebe,"Yeah, isn’t it fantastic?",3,18
monica,"Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to get married?",3,18
phoebe,"What, he’s 18.",3,18

alice,oh.,3,18
chandler,"If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?",3,18
ross,And so now you guys are going to be married?,3,18
alice,"Yeah. you know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.",3,18
rachel,Oh my God!! Great!,3,18
phoebe,"Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that?",3,18
frank,"I mean, how hard can it be? You know, I mean, you know, babies, you know who doesn’t want babies right? And besides you know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will,‘because you know, it’ll be me. Right?",3,18
alice,"You know, I mean, really we do realise that there’s an age difference between us.",3,18
phoebe,Oh good! Okay. Because you were acting like you didn’t.,3,18
alice,"Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?",3,18
hypnosis tape,"You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don’t need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.",3,18

rachel,"Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.",3,18
monica,"Pete, can I get you something else?",3,18
pete,"Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you’re given’‘them out.",3,18
monica,Haven’t you and I covered that topic?,3,18
pete,"Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you….",3,18
monica,"Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.",3,18
pete,"Well, if that were true, I’d dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.  Come on, you think she should go out with me, don’t you?",3,18
rachel,"Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that isn't a pretty picture in the morning, you know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, you know.",3,18
monica,"I mean really, think about it.",3,18
pete,"Ho-ho, I will.",3,18
phoebe,"No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life, you know. You know, I don’t want to be all judgmental, you know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!",3,18
ross,"Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?",3,18
phoebe,"No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing you know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!",3,18
joey,"Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.",3,18
phoebe,"But, I mean, do you think he’s going to enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank,  and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and you know what, it’s not good home economics.",3,18
joey,"Well, have-have you told him how you feel?",3,18
phoebe,Yes. Not out loud.,3,18
ross,"Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s going to be married, and then you’re going to hate yourself.",3,18
phoebe,"Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s going to hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t.  But, you guys can, please you got to talk him out of it.",3,18
ross and joey,No-no-no-no-no.,3,18
phoebe,"Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!",3,18
ross and joey,No.,3,18
phoebe,"Okay, I’m going to go get Frank.",3,18
joey,"So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.",3,18
rachel,I think you should definitely go out with this guy.,3,18
monica,"Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me.",3,18

ross,"Yeah, yeah.",3,18
joey,Why can’t I find that?,3,18
ross,"Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!",3,18

phoebe,"Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?",3,18
alice,"Absolutely. Okay, first we’ll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn’t work we can go back to",3,18
phoebe,"You know what, forget it. It’s ruined.",3,18
alice,"Oh no-no, never say that. If we can’t get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.",3,18
phoebe,"Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.",3,18
pete,"Okay, that’s great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.",3,18

pete,"Well, you know, I never know how much to tip.",3,18
monica,"You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?",3,18
employee,"Umm, I’m still here.",3,18
pete,"You’re taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn’t leave you that tip, you wouldn’t of come down here, we wouldn’t be having this argument, and there wouldn’t be this ah, heat between us.",3,18
monica,What?!,3,18
pete,"Come on, you got to admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. because you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we’re like this-this couple that fights.",3,18
monica,"Okay, umm, you’re a loon.",3,18

frank,"Hi.  Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It’s-it’s me!",3,18
phoebe,"Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?",3,18

phoebe,"What umm, what happened?",3,18
frank,"Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.",3,18
phoebe,"Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?",3,18
frank,"Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, you know, but I don’t see how I could all of the sudden be too young, because I’m older than I was when we first got together.",3,18
phoebe,"Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But,you know what, maybe it’s just all for the best?",3,18
frank,"Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!",3,18
phoebe,"Oh, sweetie, oh.",3,18
frank,"You know, I just was finally happyyou know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it’s still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kind of went away. And now it’s, and now it’s gone and I don’t know why!",3,18
phoebe,"Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But,you know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?",3,18
frank,What?,3,18
phoebe,"Umm, well I, I kind of had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together,you know. And you’re going to see it to, one day, you really, really will.",3,18
frank,"Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?",3,18
phoebe,Okay.,3,18
frank,"Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.",3,18
phoebe,"Okay, but.",3,18
frank,"Wait,you know what, I-I came to you because I thought you’d understand! Oh no!!you know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go",3,18

alice,Hi Frank.,3,18
frank,"Hi, Mrs. Knight.",3,18
alice,"Phoebe’s right Frank. I know it’s hard to hear, but it would’ve been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not.  Is that it, is that what it is?",3,18

rachel,"Oh, okay.",3,19
mark,"I’ve kind of of had this ah, this crush on you.  But since you were with Ross, I-I didn’t do anything about it. But, now that you’re not, I’d really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that’s-that’s what I’m doing, now.",3,19
rachel,Wow! Umm....,3,19
gunther,I dropped a cup.,3,19
pete,"...so you know, that’s why, within a few years, that voice recognition is going to be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. You know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car. ’Clean my room.’ It’s not going to be able to do any of those things, but it’ll understand what you’re saying.",3,19
monica,"Oh, this is so great.",3,19
pete,"Yeah, it was.",3,19
monica,All right then.  Bye.,3,19
monica,"Hello, people who do not live here.",3,19
all,Hi! Hello!,3,19
monica,I gave you a key for emergencies!,3,19
phoebe,We were out of Doritos.,3,19
ross,"Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?",3,19
chandler,"Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.",3,19
monica,"He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so funny, and so sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!!",3,19
ross,Still?!,3,19
monica,"No!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.",3,19
chandler,Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?,3,19
monica,Two.,3,19
chandler,Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?,3,19
joey,"Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!",3,19
ross,I guess he must have gotten the part in that play.,3,19
monica and phoebe,Oh.,3,19
chandler,"Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.",3,19
the director,Joe. How’s it going?,3,19
joey,Good.  Hey.,3,19
kate,Hi.,3,19
joey,"Oh, so you’re playing Adrienne, huh?",3,19
kate,Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?,3,19
joey,"Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I’m Joey Tribbiani.",3,19
kate,"Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.",3,19
joey,"So the ah, play’s pretty great, huh?",3,19
kate,"Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray’s work. She’s so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.",3,19
joey,"Oh, forget about it. She rocks!",3,19
kate,Where do I know you from?,3,19
joey,Dr. Drake Ramoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.,3,19
kate,"No, that’s not it. So, you’re a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?",3,19
joey,"Hey, I’ve done plays before. I’m a serious actor.",3,19
kate,That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You’re-you’re-you’re the guy that doesn’t know how to pour milk!!,3,19
joey,"See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn’t. Now, see, that’s acting.",3,19
kate,"Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.",3,19
joey,"Yeah, that was real.",3,19
phoebe,Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.,3,19
rachel,I know.,3,19
phoebe,"What, so what are you going to tell him?",3,19
rachel,"Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m going to tell him no.",3,19
phoebe,Huh.,3,19
rachel,"I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now.  Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. You know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.",3,19
phoebe,"Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.",3,19
rachel,I don’t have any issues with my Father.,3,19
phoebe,"Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.",3,19
joey,"I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me.",3,19
ross,Hello.,3,19
chandler and joey,Hey!,3,19
ross,So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.,3,19
joey,"Wow, what-what do you think she wants?",3,19
ross,"Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.",3,19
chandler,"It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive.",3,19
ross,Then be supportive like a guy.,3,19
chandler,"If I broke up with you, I’d miss you.",3,19
ross,Hi.,3,19
rachel,Hi!,3,19
ross,"You ah, wanted to see me?",3,19
rachel,"Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff.",3,19
ross,What?!,3,19
rachel,"OH, you know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.",3,19
ross,What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?,3,19
rachel,"No. Ross, it, it just seems that you know it’s time we-we you know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?",3,19
ross,Yes.,3,19
rachel,Yeah?,3,19
ross,"Yes, I do.",3,19
rachel,Good.,3,19
ross,"Yeah, I-I really do.  Hey! This-this was a gift?!",3,19
rachel,"Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.",3,19

rachel,"Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.",3,19
ross,"No!!you know-You know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where, where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm,  Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too. Yes, I do.",3,19
rachel,You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!,3,19
ross,"I’m just trying to help you, move on.",3,19
rachel,"Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....",3,19
ross,Petty...,3,19
rachel,Petty...,3,19
ross,Petty...,3,19
rachel,Petty...,3,19
ross,Petty...,3,19
rachel,Small...,3,19
ross,Small...,3,19
rachel,You are so just doing this out of spite.,3,19
ross,"Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!",3,19
rachel,Huh?,3,19
ross,I’m-I’m going to wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!,3,19
rachel,You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!,3,19
ross,"Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...",3,19
rachel,yeah-yeah-yeah!!,3,19
ross,"Oh-oh, okay, okay!  If you don’t mind I’m going to the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt.  You have a pleasant evening.",3,19
phoebe,"So, you’re like a zillionaire?",3,19
chandler,And you’re our age. You’re our age.,3,19
phoebe,"You know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.",3,19
pete,What like Pete Dakota?,3,19
phoebe,"Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.",3,19
joey,"Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.",3,19
chandler,That’s not a state Joe.,3,19
joey,"Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?",3,19
pete,"I got to go, so ah, I’ll see you guys later.",3,19
all,Okay.,3,19
chandler,You’re our age!,3,19
pete,"So ah, we on for tomorrow?",3,19
monica,"Absolutely!  Now get out of here you!!   Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!",3,19
phoebe,"Yeah, kind of.",3,19
kate,Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?,3,19
joey,"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothing’. You look at me, and it’s nothing’.  Nothing.",3,19
the director,"Tasty! I’m really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it’s-it’s nice.",3,19
kate,I have a question about this scene.,3,19
the director,Yes?,3,19
kate,"Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor.",3,19
the director,"Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking.",3,19
joey,Yeah.,3,19
kate,I think my character’s going to need a little bit more of reason than that.,3,19
joey,"Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! You know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.",3,19
kate,It doesn’t say that in the script.,3,19
joey,It does in mine!,3,19
chandler,"I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?",3,19
ross,You bug me.,3,19
chandler,Is there any chance you didn’t see that?,3,19
chandler,Ross! You got to stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re going to get peep eye!,3,19
ross,"I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! You know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!",3,19
chandler,You didn’t just break up.,3,19
ross,"Hey, it’s been like three weeks!",3,19
chandler,You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!,3,19
ross,"Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m going to kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this.  Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she’s going in.",3,19
chandler,Okay.,3,19
ross,"She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!",3,19
chandler,And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.,3,19
ross,"Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!",3,19
chandler,Stop what?!,3,19
ross,"I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!",3,19
chandler,No!! You can’t!!,3,19
ross,"Look, they must be stopped!",3,19
chandler,"I am your friend, and I am not going to let you do this!!  You are surprisingly strong!",3,19
ross,I need juice! People need juice!!,3,19
chandler,Look man!,3,19
ross,People need juice!,3,19
chandler,Listen to me!!,3,19
ross,"Juice, I need...",3,19
chandler,"She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s going to be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.",3,19
ross,"Yeah, okay.",3,19
chandler,Okay.,3,19
ross,It’s just I miss her so much.,3,19
chandler,I know.,3,19
mark,Why do all you’re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?,3,19
rachel,"Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",3,19
rachel,You know what?,3,19
mark,No. And I don’t think I’m going to want to.,3,19
rachel,I can’t do this.,3,19
mark,"Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know.",3,19
rachel,"Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, you know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.",3,19
mark,"Ahh! Fair, schmair! you know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!",3,19
rachel,Oh God. I’m sorry about this.,3,19
mark,That’s okay.,3,19
rachel,You sure?,3,19
mark,Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.,3,19
spokeswoman,"...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...",3,19
pete,"Hey, can I ask you something?",3,19
monica,Sure.,3,19
pete,Where are we?,3,19
monica,"Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m going to say, midget rodeo.",3,19
pete,Just tell me the truth.,3,19
monica,"Okay. Umm, you know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.",3,19
pete,"Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that like a year ago?",3,19
monica,"So I did tell you. Okay, you know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. you know what I mean?",3,19
pete,"Oh, yeah. I know that.",3,19
monica,I so want to be attracted to you.,3,19
pete,"But you’re not. Okay, good.",3,19
monica,I’m sorry.,3,19
pete,"You know what, don’t be. This is not, don’t be because it’s not so bad.",3,19
monica,It’s not?,3,19
pete,"I know I’m no John Bon Jovi,  or someone who find attractive, I’m just, I think,you know, that you might end up feeling differently.",3,19
monica,"Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too.",3,19
pete,"Yeah, stupidly charming isn’t’ it? Well listen let’s, you want to get something to eat? because this place is kind of depressing.",3,19
spokeswoman,And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.,3,19
pete,One second.,3,19
chandler,I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.  Draw!!,3,19
chandler,"I wasn’t doing anything.  Uh-oh, what did she do now?",3,19
joey,"Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!",3,19
chandler,"Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.",3,19
joey,"God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’",3,19
chandler,I think somebody has a crush on somebody.,3,19
joey,"Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?!you know?",3,19
chandler,"I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.",3,19
joey,"Oh.  OH. OH, you’re out of your mind.",3,19
chandler,"Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!",3,19
joey,"Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!",3,19
kate,Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?,3,19
joey,"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothing’. You look at me, and nothing’.  Nothing.",3,19
the director,"You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we’re going to pick it up here, tomorrow.",3,19
kate,"Well, that was ah...",3,19

kate,"Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. Good night.",3,19
joey,"Ah, Kate?",3,19
kate,Yeah?,3,19
joey,"You ah, you forgot your shoes.",3,19

joey,"Hey, listen you ah....",3,19
kate,Hmm?,3,19
joey,...feel like getting a cup of coffee?,3,19
kate,Umm.,3,19
the director,Kate?,3,19

the director,You ready to go?,3,19
kate,Yeah.,3,19
the director,Very nice. Very nice.,3,19

joey,"Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.",3,19
phoebe,"Hey!  Why isn’t it Spiderman? You know like Goldman, Silverman...",3,19
chandler,Because it’s-it’s not his last name.,3,19
phoebe,It isn’t?,3,19
chandler,"No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. you know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.",3,19
phoebe,"Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!",3,19
rachel,Hey!,3,19
monica,"Hey, Rach, how was work?",3,19
rachel,"Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.",3,19
monica,"By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.",3,19
rachel,"Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just going to throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and...",3,19
monica,Something wrong?,3,19
rachel,No. Nothing.,3,19
chandler,"So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?",3,19
phoebe,"Okay well, he would turn things to gold.",3,19
chandler,What about things that are already gold?,3,19
phoebe,"Ahh, his work is done.",3,19
chandler,"Okay, let’s play my game now.",3,19
phoebe,Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!,3,19
chandler,"Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!",3,20
joey,Yeah! Oh my God!  Is this what it’s like to be you?,3,20
monica,"Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?",3,20
joey,"Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart!",3,20
phoebe,"Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this!",3,20
ross,Hey!,3,20

ross,"Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.",3,20
monica,"Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!",3,20
ross,We were all pretty shaken up about it.,3,20
phoebe,"Wait, am I missing something though? Because I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way.",3,20
ross,"Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.",3,20
monica,"Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch!   And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?",3,20
ross,You get the dollhouse.,3,20

phoebe,"Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.",3,20
joey,"Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?",3,20
phoebe,"No, just a barrel.",3,20
monica,"You know what, you can play with my dollhouse.",3,20
phoebe,Really?! Really?!,3,20
monica,"Any time you want. You know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.",3,20
chandler,My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.,3,20
rachel,"Hey, Sophie!",3,20

phoebe,"That’s a dog, every house should have a dog.",3,20
monica,Not one that can pee on the roof.,3,20
phoebe,"Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.",3,20
chandler,And is this in case the house sneezes?,3,20
phoebe,"No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic.",3,20
monica,I don’t want a ghost.,3,20
phoebe,"Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.",3,20
ross,"Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.",3,20
phoebe,"Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.",3,20
rachel,Hey!,3,20

chandler,"Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checking’ out the Chan-Chan man!",3,20
rachel,"That was  surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?",3,20
chandler,"Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it.",3,20
rachel,"Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s going to love me.",3,20
phoebe,"Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh!  Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!",3,20
monica,"Okay, Phoebe, you know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.",3,20
phoebe,"Okay,  fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination.",3,20

lauren,"Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.",3,20
joey,They gave me the shaft all right.,3,20
lauren,"Oh, you’re so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?",3,20

monica,"It’s very interesting, Phoebe.",3,20

ross,This is the coolest house ever!!,3,20
phoebe,"Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?",3,20

chandler,"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.",3,20
rachel,Hmm.,3,20
chandler,"Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!",3,20
joanna,Chandler is fantastic!!,3,20
rachel,What?!,3,20
joanna,"Oh God, we just clicked! You know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?",3,20

sophie,Isn’t this great?!,3,20
joanna,Don’t spoil it.,3,20
joey,"Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?",3,20
the director,"Hello. Oh! It’s you. Just ah, just one-one sec.  I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!",3,20
joey,That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?,3,20
kate,He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you’re dating.,3,20
joey,"Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I’m going out with?",3,20
kate,"I don’t care. Why, do you want me to care?",3,20
joey,Do you want me to want you to care?,3,20
kate,Do you?,3,20
joey,What?,3,20
the director,"Okay, I’m afraid to say this, but let’s pick it up where we left off.",3,20
joey,"Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?",3,20
kate,I’ve got no reason to stay.,3,20
the director,Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I’ll see you in the morning.,3,20
kate,"I can’t believe we go on in, in a week.",3,20
joey,"Hey, it’s going to be all right.",3,20
lauren,"Hey! So since we’re getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?",3,20
joey,What?,3,20
lauren,You know! At the place I told you about last night?,3,20
joey,"Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, you know what, I think I kind of need to work on my stuff tonight.",3,20
lauren,"Oh, okay.",3,20
joey,Okay.,3,20
lauren,I’ll see you tomorrow.,3,20
joey,Okay.,3,20
lauren,Good night.,3,20
joey,"Ah, are you okay?",3,20
kate,"Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we going to do about this scene, huh?",3,20
joey,I don’t know.,3,20
kate,"Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.",3,20
joey,How do you mean?,3,20
kate,"Well, Adrian’s looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can’t just kiss her, he’s got to, got to really give her a reason, you know?",3,20
joey,Maybe he could slip her the tongue.,3,20
kate,"Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.",3,20
joey,"Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.",3,20
kate,"And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!",3,20
joey,"And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!",3,20
kate,"And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....",3,20
joey,Something like that?,3,20
kate,"Yeah, that’s pretty much what I had in mind.",3,20
joey,Yeah.,3,20
joey,Hey.,3,20
ross,Hi.,3,20
joey,Hey.,3,20
ross,Hi.,3,20
joey,Hey.,3,20

joey,"No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.",3,20
ross,oh!,3,20
monica,You’re kidding?! That’s great!,3,20
joey,"Oh, it was so amazing. After the  love making...",3,20
monica,Oh my.,3,20
joey,"Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming because, because her eyes keep going like this.",3,20
chandler,"I’m telling you, Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’",3,20
rachel,"OH, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?",3,20
chandler,That’s what you say at the end of a date.,3,20
rachel,"You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’",3,20
chandler,"To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just you know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.",3,20
monica,"Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?",3,20
rachel,"Well, they always called.",3,20
monica,"Hmm, bite me.",3,20
joanna,Did he call?,3,20
rachel,No. Sorry.,3,20
joanna,Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?,3,20
sophie,"Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.",3,20
joanna,"Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?",3,20
rachel,"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",3,20
joanna,Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?,3,20
rachel,Well...,3,20
joanna,"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?",3,20
rachel,No. I...,3,20
joanna,"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.",3,20
rachel,Call her! Call her now!,3,20
chandler,"Multiple, so many paper cuts.",3,20
rachel,"Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!",3,20
chandler,"Oh, well give me the phone then.",3,20
rachel,"Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!",3,20
chandler,"Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’",3,20
rachel,Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.,3,20
chandler,Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!,3,20
rachel,"I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!",3,20
chandler,"All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!",3,20
rachel,That’s fine!,3,20
chandler,"That’s just a lot of big talk, you know.",3,20
rachel,I know.,3,20
ross,Mon?,3,20
monica,I’m in the shower!,3,20
ross,"Oh, fire! There, there’s a fire! Fire!!",3,20
joey,Hey.,3,20
kate,Hi.,3,20

kate,About what?,3,20
joey,"You know, about what happened with us.",3,20
kate,"Nooo. And there’s really no reason he should find out, so ah let’s not make a big deal about it, okay?",3,20
joey,"What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there, you’re not that good an actress.",3,20
kate,"Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That’s all it was. Joey, I’m-I’m sorry you feel bad, but haven’t you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?",3,20
joey,Nooo.,3,20
lauren,"Hi, Kate!",3,20
kate,"Hi, Lauren.",3,20

ross,"Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.",3,20
phoebe,All right. Did everyone get out okay?,3,20
monica,"Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate.",3,20
phoebe,OH. What is this?,3,20
ross,"No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!!",3,20
phoebe,"OH, the-the Foster puppets!",3,20
chandler,"It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here,  and it’s all the time.",3,20
joanna,"Well, thanks again for lunch.",3,20
chandler,"Yes, this, this was pleasant.",3,20
joanna,"It was, wasn’t it?",3,20
chandler,"The food there was, was great.",3,20
joanna,Wasn’t it?,3,20
chandler,So take care.,3,20
joanna,You too.,3,20
chandler,"Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.",3,20
joanna,"Great! I’m looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?",3,20
rachel,Sophie’s desk.,3,20
rachel,Chandler!! Are you going to call her!,3,20
chandler,No!,3,20
rachel,Chandler!!,3,20
chandler,"Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.",3,20
rachel,"Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now.",3,20
chandler,Ah—I’m not going to call you.,3,20
joanna,What?,3,20
chandler,"I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, you know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy,  mascara goop. And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.",3,20
joanna,"Well, this isn’t how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.",3,20
chandler,"Yeah, o-okay.",3,20
joanna,So...,3,20
chandler,Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!,3,20
joey,"Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’ve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I’ve ah, I’ve recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me?  Great. Thanks. Okay, bye.  Hello, Jennifer?

monica,Okay.,3,21
pete,So ask me what I did today.,3,21
monica,So what did you do today Pete?,3,21
pete,I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.,3,21
monica,What?! Oh.,3,21
monica,Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?,3,21
rachel,What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?,3,21
monica,"I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues.  But Pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me.",3,21
rachel,And you’re still not attracted to him at all?,3,21
monica,"Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.",3,21
rachel,"Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health teacher.",3,21
monica,"Oh, please.",3,21
monica,What? Honey.,3,21

rachel,I know.,3,21
rachel,Ow!!,3,21
monica,Oh God!,3,21
ross,"Hey, you guys! Guess what?",3,21
rachel,Got a job on a river boat?,3,21
ross,"You know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...",3,21
rachel,"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",3,21
ross,Right.,3,21
rachel,"Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like.",3,21
ross,You like it right?,3,21
monica,Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!,3,21
rachel,"Yeah, come here!",3,21
monica,What-what was it you were going to tell us?,3,21
rachel,Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!,3,21
ross,"Okay, good bye!",3,21
chandler,"So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.",3,21
phoebe,"Umm, oh, about three months.",3,21
chandler,"Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.",3,21
joey,Hey!!,3,21
chandler,Hey!,3,21
joey,I got you something! Open it! Open it!,3,21
chandler,Okay.  It’s a chicken.,3,21
joey,"It’s cute, huh?",3,21
phoebe,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?",3,21
chandler,Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.,3,21
phoebe,"Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s of love.",3,21
joey,"Oh, well no problem there.",3,21
chandler,Easy Lenny.,3,21
pete,So? I mean have you thought about it?,3,21
monica,Okay. Here’s the thing.,3,21
pete,"Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What’s the thing?",3,21
monica,"I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....",3,21
pete,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, that’s-that’s what you’re worried about? If that’s the problem, we’ve got no problem.",3,21
monica,Huh?,3,21
pete,"No! Look, I was going to tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.",3,21
monica,Oh?,3,21
pete,"Her name’s Ann, she’s a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.",3,21
monica,"Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so happy for you. And now I can work for you!",3,21
pete,I guess you can.,3,21
monica,"Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! OH!  All right, you know what? I’m just going to roll right into that office and-and quit!",3,21
pete,All right.,3,21
monica,Okay.  Can you give me a little push?,3,21
pete,"Yeah, sure. Good luck!",3,21
monica,I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo!  I’m okay!! I’m all right!!,3,21
phoebe,"Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.",3,21
pete,What?,3,21
phoebe,"I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?",3,21
pete,Why would you say that?,3,21
phoebe,"Because you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so because you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...",3,21
pete,You’re good. You’re good!,3,21
phoebe,"Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift.",3,21
pete,"Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?",3,21
phoebe,"Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?",3,21
pete,Thanks a lot.,3,21
phoebe,"No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.",3,21
chandler,"Okay, but this is the last time.  With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chicken.",3,21
joey,Hey.,3,21
chandler,Hey.,3,21
joey,How’s she doing?,3,21
chandler,She?,3,21
joey,"Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?",3,21

chandler,I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!,3,21
joey,Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?,3,21
chandler,You don’t think I get up when you get up?,3,21
joey,"oh, here it comes.",3,21
chandler,"Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister!",3,21
joey,Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!,3,21
chandler,And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?,3,21
joey,"That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...",3,21
chandler,"I know what you meant!!  You notice that ever since we got this chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?",3,21
joey,"I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.",3,21
chandler,I’ll take her back tomorrow.,3,21
joey,Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?,3,21
ross,Hey!,3,21
chandler,Hey!,3,21
ross,"oh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think?  This blue suit, or this brown one?",3,21
joey,"Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.",3,21
ross,Really?,3,21
rachel,Oww!,3,21
ross,Wow! That aspirin dance really works!,3,21

ross,"And I’m sure you’re going to make a big impression. Hi! I’m Rachel Green. It’s nice to meet you.  Come on, you probably have a broken rib!",3,21
rachel,"Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be broken then.",3,21

chandler,"You know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. You know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.",3,23
ross,"At least they knew what yours was. You know, yours had a name.",3,23
joey,"Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! You know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, ""Aww, he's got a Ross.""",3,23

chandler,"Well, if he's going to break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If you know what I mean.",3,23
joey,"Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.",3,23
phoebe,"and I-I can't take it! You know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is going to catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.",3,23
rachel,"Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?",3,23
phoebe,Uh.,3,23
joey,"Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?",3,23

phoebe,"Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m going to do that for you.",3,23
vince,"Uh yeah, I can’t believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.",3,23
chandler,"Everything’s going to be all right. Okay, Dick?",3,23
guru saj,"Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  That’s supposed to be a duck right? because otherwise, this is way out of my league.",3,23
joey,"Yeah, yeah. He’s got a, he’s got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can’t do anything about it. Is there something you can do?",3,23
guru saj,"Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?",3,23
chandler,"Do you think that there’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign, and it says “You’re in Sample.”",3,24
monica,Hey.,3,24
all,Hey!,3,24
rachel,How’d it go with Pete?!,3,24
joey,Tell us!,3,24
monica,"You’re not going to believe this. Okay, so I go over...",3,24
billy crystal,"I’m sorry. Ex-excuse us. I’m sorry, it’s a little crowded. Do you mind if we...",3,24
robin williams,"Yeah, could you scooch?",3,24
billy,"Yeah, move over just a little bit.",3,24
robin,Keep on scooching.,3,24
monica,"So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...",3,24
robin,Why? Why?! What’s wrong with me?!,3,24
billy,What’s the matter?,3,24
robin,"I have a feeling’... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.",3,24
billy,How do you know?,3,24
robin,"Well you know, he’s got access.",3,24
billy,Yeah.,3,24
robin,"You know it’s that feeling you get, you know?",3,24
billy,Like when you go bowling and you know you’re in somebody else’s shoes?,3,24
robin,That’s the one.,3,24
phoebe,"All right, so, so you went to Pete’s...",3,24
ross,What happened?,3,24
monica,I...,3,24
robin,"Why is this happening to me?! I don’t know, maybe it’s my wound.",3,24
monica,Forget it.,3,24
billy,So it’s-it’s not heeled yet?,3,24
robin,"No-no, it’s oozing, oozing.  Could you pass me the cream? Is there any—Oh, there’s the cream.",3,24
billy,"Thomas, this is going to be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.",3,24
robin,"What is it, Tim?",3,24
billy,"It’s me, I’ve been sleeping with your wife.",3,24
joey,So you’re the gynaecologist?,3,24
billy,"Hey, I’m trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!",3,24
robin,"Ooh,  Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin?  Would you--Give me this thing  all right!! Enough!  And you are no longer my friend! We are finished!  Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!!  Get away from me!!",3,24
billy,"Thomas, come back here!",3,24
phoebe,"So Monica, what were you going to tell us?",3,24
monica,I have no idea.,3,24
rachel,"So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?",3,24
phoebe,"No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name.",3,24
monica,He didn’t ask me to marry him.,3,24
all,OH.,3,24
phoebe,Well then definitely don’t take his name.,3,24
monica,He wanted to tell me he’s going to compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.,3,24
the guys,Pete?!,3,24
rachel,Why?! What is it?,3,24
monica,I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sort of like wrestling.,3,24
phoebe,Oh?!,3,24
monica,"Yeah, but without the costumes.",3,24
phoebe,Oh.,3,24
joey,"And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.",3,24
chandler,"Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are",3,24
monica,"So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff?",3,24
ross,"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.",3,24
monica,What’s fish hooking?,3,24
ross,"Huh, what’s fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",3,24
joey,"What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.",3,24
doug,"So thanks for the warm welcome. It’s good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let’s go out there and get them! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I’ in team.",3,24
chandler,"Yes, but there’s two in martini, so everybody back to my office.",3,24
doug,You! Chuckles! What’s your name?,3,24
chandler,"Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah...",3,24
doug,"No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny.  This team is about hard work, but it’s also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!",3,24
ross,"That’s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six.  Thank you.   Yeah, we have the reservations.",3,24
rachel,Yes!!,3,24
chandler,"All right buddy, way to go!",3,24
ross,"Dude, what are you doing?",3,24
chandler,"Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.",3,24
phoebe,"Yeesh, what’d you do about it?",3,24
chandler,"Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.",3,24
monica,"I got to tell you, I think it’s okay to be that guy.",3,24
joey,"Yeah, maybe it’s like you know, that jock thing. You know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.",3,24
rachel,"You know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by you know, grabbing’ her boob.",3,24
chandler,"Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just you know, stick your head in between ‘them.",3,24
monica,"Okay, can we please go eat?",3,24
joey,Yeah. What are we getting?,3,24
monica,Anything but stew.,3,24
ross,"All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. You know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.",3,24
joey,"Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. You know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack you, his hand will smell.  Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?",3,24
chandler,What if Joey were president?,3,24
phoebe,"Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?",3,24
rachel,Yeah.,3,24
phoebe,"Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?",3,24
rachel,"Oh, ah with who?",3,24
phoebe,"Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it...",3,24
rachel,"Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?",3,24
phoebe,"You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...",3,24
rachel,Oh!  That’s fine.,3,24
phoebe,"Great! Okay, good for you!",3,24
hoshi,"You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?",3,24
pete,"I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?",3,24
hoshi,It’s just hard when I know I have e-mail I can’t get!,3,24
monica,Hi!,3,24
pete,Monica!  Hi honey.,3,24
hoshi,"All right, on the table.",3,24
monica,"Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, because I kind of like you.",3,24
pete,"Oh, believe me, I don’t want to get hurt either. I’m being smart about this. See these guys? They’re the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin.  A house painter! He used to be a house painter.",3,24
monica,Promise me you’ll be careful.,3,24
pete,I promise.,3,24
monica,"Hey, are we still on for tonight?",3,24
pete,Yeah.,3,24
monica,"Okay, good, because umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...",3,24
hoshi,No! No boom-boom before big fight!,3,24
monica,How ‘bout just a boom?,3,24
rachel,"Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?",3,24
phoebe,Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.,3,24
bonnie,Hi!,3,24
rachel,This is Bonnie?  This is Bonnie?  You’re Bonnie?,3,24
bonnie,I can show you an ID if you want?,3,24
rachel,"Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.",3,24
bonnie,"Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.",3,24
rachel,"Oh, that must be it.",3,24
phoebe,Well I hope you have fun tonight.,3,24
bonnie,Thanks! You too.,3,24
rachel,You said she was bald.,3,24
phoebe,"Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.",3,24
rachel,How could you not tell me that she has hair?,3,24
phoebe,"I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.",3,24
rachel,"OH, well, this is just perfect!",3,24
phoebe,"Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.",3,24
rachel,"Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, you know, that girl has hair got all over head!",3,24
phoebe,"Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.",3,24
rachel,"Why, does she have a bad personality?",3,24
phoebe,"Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!",3,24
doug,"Bing!  Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun.  Ooh. Barely got you that time, get over here. Come on.  Wham!  Good one. That was a good one.  Keep at it team.",3,24
chandler,What is with him?,3,24
phil,"With him? You’re is favourite, you’re his guy!",3,24
stevens,We never get smacked.,3,24
chandler,"Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once.",3,24
phil,"Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.",3,24
stevens,"I’m telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.",3,24
doug,Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?,3,24
chandler,No sir.,3,24
doug,There you go.,3,24
ross,Hey!,3,24
monica,"God Ross, what is that?",3,24
ross,"Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!",3,24
announcer,"From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He’s known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!",3,24
monica,"I love you, Pete!!!",3,24
announcer,"And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He’s a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!",3,24
monica,Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!,3,24
pete,"Don’t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent’s strength and weight against him.",3,24
ross,"Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.",3,24
ross,All right! You go get him! Let’s go!,3,24
referee,"Here we go gentlemen, here we go!  Are you ready?   Are you ready?  Let’s get it on!!",3,24
pete,Uh-oh.,3,24
monica,Hey!  It’s me. Mon-I-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.,3,24
pete,"It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant “You suck!”",3,24
monica,"I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.",3,24
pete,"What, look back?",3,24
monica,"Well, you’re not going to get going are you?",3,24
pete,Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?,3,24
monica,"Well, no. But...",3,24
pete,Well I’m not going to stop until I’m the Ultimate Fighting Champion.,3,24
monica,That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!,3,24
pete,"Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad’s garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.",3,24
monica,You didn’t know that already?,3,24
pete,"Look, I’m going to get better. Okay? I promise you.",3,24
monica,"Okay, just get a lot better.  Fast.",3,24
pete,"Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.",3,24
monica,Yeah. That-that was the problem.,3,24
monica,Hey.,3,24
ross,Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?,3,24
monica,"Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.",3,24
ross,Hot dog?,3,24
monica,"Four, please.  I’m really nervous.  Thank you.",3,24
phoebe,"So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?",3,24
ross,"What? Oh! I got to tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific.",3,24
phoebe,"OH, that’s too bad!",3,24
ross,"No, I-I’m saying I liked her.",3,24
phoebe,"Yeah, you know what, there are other fish in the sea.",3,24
ross,"Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again.",3,24
phoebe,"Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?",3,24
chandler,Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?,3,24
ross,"Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.",3,24
joey,"Hey, the fight’s starting!",3,24
ross,"Okay, we’ll be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?",3,24
chandler,"Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s going to be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.",3,24
joey,Fight’s over!,3,24
chandler,"Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!",3,24
doug,Bing! You got those numbers for me?,3,24
chandler,"No, I ah, I didn’t do them.",3,24
doug,"Oh, you forgot?",3,24
chandler,"No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.",3,24
doug,"Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller.  That’s okay, you’re still my number one guy!  Bing!",3,24
chandler,Doug!!,3,24
doug,Hmm.,3,24
chandler,I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.,3,24
doug,"Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I got to tell you, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!",3,24
chandler,"No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.",3,24
doug,Oh?,3,24
chandler,"Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.",3,24
doug,"Well, say no more. You know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You’re okay.",3,24
chandler,Okay.,3,24
doug,Ha!  Ah!,3,24
chandler,Ah!,3,24
phoebe,"Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?",3,24
rachel,"Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.",3,24
phoebe,No! No! Look at that!  It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!,3,24
rachel,Phoebe!,3,24
phoebe,"Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.",3,24
rachel,"Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...",3,24
phoebe,"Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.",3,24
rachel,"OH!  Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s going to marry her, and this is all your fault.",3,24
phoebe,You said it was okay!,3,24
rachel,You said she was bald!!,3,24
phoebe,What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!,3,24
rachel,"Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!",3,24
phoebe,"Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?",3,24
rachel,Yes.,3,24
phoebe,Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?,3,24
rachel,Yes.,3,24
phoebe,So?,3,24
rachel,"I just you know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!",3,24
phoebe,Oh no.,3,24
rachel,What?,3,24
phoebe,"Oh, we killed them all.",3,24
rachel,Oh!,3,24
pete,"It’s okay, it’s not as bad as it looks, it’s a precaution. Ah, I’m not supposed to move my spine.",3,24
monica,Please tell me you’re stopping now.,3,24
pete,"I’m fine! I’d fight tonight, if they’d let me.  See this circle I’m marking off here? This is my zone of terror.",3,24
monica,You are insane! You-you got to give this up!,3,24
pete,"I can’t until I’m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I’m telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I’m not saying I could beat Superman, but you know, kids are stupid.",3,24
monica,"Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!",3,24
pete,"You know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt.",3,24
monica,"Well then, you know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re going to have to do it without me.",3,24
pete,"Well if you’re asking me to quit, then you’re asking me to be someone I’m not. I’ve got to do this.",3,24
monica,Then I’ve got to go. Bye.,3,24
pete,Mon-Monica?,3,24
monica,Yes?,3,24
pete,"Could you leave a note? because I’m on a lot of pain killers now, and I don’t know if I’ll remember this tomorrow.",3,24
doug,"So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I’m happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8",3,24
chandler,"Thank you, sir.",3,24
stevens,"Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase you know, by accident.",3,24
doug,"Of course, you did. Forgot something else too you bastard!   Well, what about you? You’re not feeling left out or anything are you?",3,24
chandler,"No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.",3,24
doug,"Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don’t you?",3,24
chandler,"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!",3,24
doug,"Now get on out of here, you!",3,24
tv announcer,"Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...",3,24
chandler,"Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!",3,24
rachel,"Oh, I can’t watch this.",3,24
joey,"Check it out, he’s winning!  Pete’s winning!",3,24
monica,Really?!,3,24
joey,No-o-o!!,3,24
tv announcer,"Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.",3,24
all,Oh! Oh!,3,24
phoebe,"Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?",3,24
ross,"Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t.",3,24
all,OH!!,3,24
chandler,"So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!",3,25
bonnie,"All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don’t know, we were, we were making out.",3,25
chandler,Tell it again.  Seriously.,3,25
rachel,I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?,3,25
joey,"Yeah, sure. Well you know, earlier she was talking about geography.",3,25
monica,"Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in.",3,25
joey,"Well, I think we all learned something.",3,25
phoebe,"Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!  That’s my Mom’s writing! Look.",3,25
chandler,"Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.",3,25
phoebe,You know what that means?,3,25
joey,That you’re actually 50?,3,25
phoebe,"No-no, that’s not, that’s not me Phoebe, that’s her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F.  Best Friends Forever.",3,25
all,Oh!,3,25
rachel,That is so cool.,3,25
phoebe,"I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?",3,25
all,"Yeah! Yeah, we can!",3,25
bonnie,"Shoot! I can’t go, I have to work!",3,25
ross,That’s too bad.,3,25
rachel,"OH, big, fat bummer.",3,25
phoebe,So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re going to drive out to Montauk.,3,25
joey,"Hey, Bonnie had sex there!",3,25
monica,Would you look at them. Am I ever going to find a boyfriend again? I going to die an old maid.,3,25
chandler,"You’re not going to die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.",3,25
monica,Thanks!,3,25
chandler,"Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your boyfriend.",3,25
monica,Yeah right.,3,25
chandler,Why is that so funny?,3,25
monica,You made a joke right? So I laughed.,3,25
chandler,"Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?",3,25
monica,"Well, no. You’re Chandler. You know, Chandler!",3,25
chandler,"Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically you know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say it’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and I’m like  “Hey, nice to meet, you. Hey, oh-hey.”",3,25
monica,Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.,3,25
joey,Hey!,3,25
monica,"Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!",3,25
joey,"No, it’s just my luggage.",3,25
"chandler, monica, and joey",Hey!!,3,25
joey,Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!,3,25
phoebe,"Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.",3,25
ross,"Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?",3,25
phoebe,"Oh, I wasn’t talking about his karma.",3,25
rachel,Hey!,3,25
chandler,Hey!,3,25
joey,"Hey-hey, check out the hat!",3,25
chandler,"What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can’t have children!!",3,25
monica,"Seriously, where did you get the hat?",3,25
rachel,Ross gave it to me.,3,25
ross,"Yeah, I think she looks good.",3,25
rachel,"OH, thank you.",3,25
chandler,"Buy it for you, or win it for you?",3,25
rachel,"Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.",3,25
phoebe,"And this time, they’ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.",3,25
ross,"Go, go, go!",3,25
rachel,"Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!",3,25
phoebe,Oy!!,3,25
monica,What’s with all this sand?,3,25
phoebe,"Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.",3,25
ross,"Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.",3,25
p senior,"Well, yes, it’s kind of an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But you know, the ocean is right there.",3,25
phoebe,"Knock, knock, knock.",3,25
p senior,"Ah, oh, hang on a second.  Come in, come in.  All right, so think about it, and call me back.",3,25

phoebe,I’m not asking!,4,1
p senior,"Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and selfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it’s like to be eighteen years old?",4,1
phoebe,"Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.",4,1
p senior,"Well, I’m so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn’t even hear about your Mom and Dad until a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don’t know, you’re here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.",4,1
phoebe,"Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And you know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! You know what, you walked out on me, and I’m just, I’m going to do the same thing to you.",4,1

rachel,I wrote you a letter.,4,1
ross,OH! Thank you! I like mail.,4,1

ursula,"All right, hang on!",4,1
monica,"Pass the cheese, please.",4,1

monica,I was in too much pain.,4,1
joey,And I was tired from digging the huge hole!,4,1
chandler,And then Joey remembered something.,4,1
joey,I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...,4,1
ross,"Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you...  Eww!! You peed on yourself?!",4,1
phoebe and rachel,Eww!!,4,1
monica,"You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was going to pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So..",4,1
"phoebe, ross, and rachel",Eww!!,4,1
joey,"That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you! Only, uh, I couldn’t. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.",4,1
chandler,"Joey kept screaming at me, “Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.",4,1
joey,That’s because sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.,4,1
phoebe,"“...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroom.”  Thank you, thank you. OH, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom.  Except for you. You go away.",4,1
p senior,"I’ll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn’t been a day where I didn’t regret giving you up.",4,1
phoebe,"Okay, bye.",4,1
p senior,"No, I’m not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn’t look you up was, well I was afraid that you’d react, just well like, the way, the way you’re reacting right now, and can’t we just, you know, start from here?",4,1
phoebe,No.,4,1
p senior,"Sorry. But just one last thing. You know you came looking for family. I’m family, I’m it. Now, now I’m done.",4,1
phoebe,"But, it’s not like we’re losing anything. You know?",4,1
p senior,"Yeah, I guess you’re right.",4,1
phoebe,It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.,4,1
p senior,"Well, I don’t know. I mean it’s not like we don’t have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.",4,1

p senior,Hey! Me too!,4,1
phoebe,"All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.",4,1
rachel,"Oh-hooo, I missed you.",4,1
ross,I missed you too.,4,1
rachel,"Ooh, I was so nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. You know?",4,1
ross,I suppose.,4,1
rachel,"You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”",4,1
ross,Umm-hmm.,4,1
rachel,"Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...",4,1
ross,WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!,4,1
chandler,Coffee house?,4,1
monica,You bet.,4,1
ross,"And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!",4,1
rachel,"Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!",4,1
ross,I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!,4,1
rachel,What?!!,4,1
ross,I fell asleep!,4,1
rachel,You fell asleep?!,4,1
ross,It was 5,4,1
rachel,You know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!,4,1
ross,FINE BY ME!!,4,1
rachel,"Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you’re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!",4,1
monica,Hey!!,4,1
rachel,Sorry!!  I just feel bad about all that sleep you’re going to miss wishing you were with me!,4,1
ross,"Oh, no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!",4,1
rachel,"And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",4,1
chandler,I KNEW IT!!!!,4,1
monica,Gin.,4,1
chandler,"We were playing Gin? you know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.",4,1
monica,Will you stop!,4,1
chandler,Okay. All right.,4,1
monica,"Okay, all right, I think you’re great, I think you’re sweet, and you’re smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.",4,1
chandler,Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!,4,2
joey,"How many times do I have to tell you! You, turn and slide! you know, turn and slide.",4,2
chandler,"You don’t turn and slide, you throw it out! I’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!",4,2
joey,"Look, we’re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!",4,2
chandler,"All right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it.",4,2
joey,"All right. But, you’re going to have to tell them.",4,2
chandler,Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet?  They seem all right with it!,4,2
chip,"Hey Monica, it’s Chip.",4,2
monica,Yes!!,4,2
ross,Who’s Chip?,4,2
monica,Shh!,4,2
chip,"Good running’ into you at the bank today, so ah, here’s my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.",4,2
monica,"Chip, is Chip Matthews.",4,2
ross,The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?,4,2
monica,"Because I ran into him at the bank, he is still so cute.",4,2
ross,"Monica, you’re so lucky! He’s like the most popular guy in school!!",4,2
monica,"I know!!   Chip? Hi! It’s Monica.  ‘Kay.  ‘Kay.  Okay.  Okay, good-bye.  Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!",4,2
ross,I was just leaving.,4,2
rachel,"Good! Because I’ve got a product report to read, it’s like eight pages, I hope I don’t fall asleep.",4,2
ross,Why? Did you write it?,4,2
rachel,"Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?",4,2
ross,"Well ah, actually...",4,2
rachel,I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.,4,2
ross,"Well, umm, why don’t you give him a call?",4,2
rachel,Okay.  Are you sure you want to hear this?,4,2
ross,"Oh, I’m sure.",4,2
rachel,"Chip! Hi, it’s Rachel.  Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message.  Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down.  Monica Geller.  OH.",4,2
ross,"Oh, that’s right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that’s got to be embarrassing!",4,2
phoebe,"...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!!   Thank you, thanks.",4,2
ross,"Hey, here’s a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?",4,2
chandler,"Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.",4,2
ross,I’m reading your ad.,4,2
joey,"Looks good, uh?",4,2
ross,Yeah.,4,2
chandler,"Stunning entertainment centre. Fine,  fine Italian craftsmanship.",4,2
phoebe,"Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment centre?",4,2
rachel,Why? I love that thing.,4,2
chandler,You want it?,4,2
phoebe and rachel,Oh no.,4,2
chandler,"Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?",4,2
joey,"Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!",4,2
chandler,"All right look, I’m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.",4,2
joey,What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.,4,2
chandler,No.,4,2
joey,Oh. What do you do?,4,2
chandler,I can’t believe you don’t know what I do for a living!,4,2
phoebe,"Yeah, I actually don’t know...",4,2
ross,"Good, so do I",4,2
rachel,Something to do with numbers?,4,2
phoebe,"Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you!  Come on. Crazy.  Oh my God.",4,2
rachel,What?,4,2
phoebe,Nothing. Nothing.,4,2
joey,What? What’s wrong?,4,2
phoebe,"I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.",4,2
rachel,You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!,4,2
phoebe,"No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.",4,2
ross,"Are you sure she’s in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?",4,2
phoebe,"No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all, okay, there’s the feeling.  Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt.  My Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy...  Cats....like....fish!   Hi, Mommy.  Oh, I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!",4,2
joey,"Dude, Phoebe’s mom has got a huge peni...",4,2
chandler,Let it go!!,4,2
monica,Hey!,4,2
rachel,"Umm, when were you going to tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews?",4,2
monica,Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?,4,2
rachel,Nooo! It’s not okay! I can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me!,4,2
monica,"What, that little thing at the prom?",4,2
rachel,Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!,4,2
monica,"Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?",4,2
rachel,"I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!",4,2
monica,"Look, you and I went to different high schools...",4,2
rachel,"Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.",4,2
monica,"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.",4,2
rachel,They had to have that specially made?!,4,2
monica,It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.,4,2
rachel,"Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!",4,2
monica,"Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.",4,2
rachel,"Oh, you go out with him.",4,2
monica,"Oh, really?!",4,2
rachel,"Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?",4,2
monica,I’ll try.,4,2
ross,So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment centre?,4,2
joey,"Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don’t think any of them are going to work out.",4,2
chandler,"Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.",4,2
phoebe,"Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.",4,2
ross,"So Pheebs, how long is your mom going to be with us?",4,2
phoebe,"Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she you know, gets used to the fact that there's you know, a new mom. You know, I think she’s worried that you know, she’s going to, she’s going to be replaced.  Well, that’s not going to happen is it? No.  Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.",4,2
monica,Why can’t you use the phone in here?,4,2
phoebe,"Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.",4,2
ross,"So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?",4,2
monica,"Ross, don’t start.",4,2
ross,"Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!",4,2
rachel,I believe it.,4,2
ross,No you don’t.,4,2
rachel,"Yes, I do.",4,2
ross,"No you do—You know what, you’re not going to suck me into this.",4,2
rachel,"Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.",4,2
ross,"I do not always have to be—okay, okay.",4,2
rachel,Jurassic Park could happen.,4,2
tony,"Wow! That’s ah, that’s pretty nice!",4,2
joey,Pretty nice?,4,2
chandler,"You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.",4,2
tony,"We don’t have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We’ve got a canoe.",4,2
chandler,"You know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.",4,2
tony,You got to take the canoe!,4,2
chandler,"All right, just, just take the entertainment centre, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!",4,2
peter,We’re not throwing it away! I built that canoe!,4,2
joey,Good for you!!,4,2
rachel,"You guys, you’re never going to believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole!  Look kind of familiar?",4,2
ross,Apparently Phoebe’s mother also goes by the name Julio.,4,2
rachel,"You guys, there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!",4,2
joey,"Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!",4,2
rachel,Do we have to tell her?,4,2
ross,"Yes, we have to tell her!",4,2
monica,"Oh, but it’s made her so happy.",4,2
ross,"Little girl misses her cat.  Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.  Okay, you know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.",4,2
all,Yeah.,4,2
ross,Thank you.,4,2
rachel,I hate when Ross is right!,4,2
monica,"He is right, isn’t he?",4,2
chandler,"You know what, I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong.",4,2
all,You think?,4,2
chandler,"Oh-no, he’s right.",4,2
phoebe,Hi.,4,2
monica,Hi!,4,2
all,Hey!,4,2
joey,"Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...",4,2
phoebe,Yeah?,4,2
joey,How’s that going?,4,2
phoebe,"So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.",4,2
joey,That’s so sweet.  I’m going to get some coffee.,4,2
monica,Huh? What’d you say Joe? I’ll be right there.,4,2
rachel,Pheebs...,4,2
phoebe,"I just feel so, uh.....",4,2
rachel,All right!!,4,2
chandler,I’m coming already!!,4,2
rachel,Jeez!,4,2
monica,Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!,4,2
rachel,"Hello, Chip.",4,2
chip,"Hey, Rach! How you doin’?",4,2
rachel,"I’m great! I’m great. I’ve got a great job at Bloomingdale’s, have wonderful friends, and even though I’m not seeing anyone right now, I’ve never felt better about myself.",4,2
chip,"So ah, Monica ready yet?",4,2
rachel,"She’ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how’s umm, Amy Welch?",4,2
chip,"Amy Welch? Wow! I haven’t seen her since... So, Monica about ready?",4,2
joey,"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",4,2
guy,What?!,4,2
joey,"Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.",4,2
guy,"No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.",4,2
joey,"Oh yeah?  If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",4,2
guy,"All right, you have yourself a deal.",4,2
joey,Okay.  See?! I told you!,4,2
joey,"Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!",4,2
chip,"Here, we are.",4,2
monica,Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!,4,2
chip,The what?,4,2
monica,"That’s what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. You know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you’re Chip. Never mind.",4,2
chip,"No, I think it’s cute.",4,2
monica,Wow! A lipper from Chipper.,4,2
chip,So you still in touch with anyone from high school?,4,2
monica,"Umm. Well, there’s Rachel, and umm, I think that’s it. How bout you?",4,2
chip,"Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, you know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.",4,2
monica,Is that all?,4,2
chip,"Eh, you know after high school, you just kind of lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.",4,2
monica,"OH, how is he?",4,2
chip,"Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.",4,2
monica,Isn’t he an architect now?,4,2
chip,"Yeah, they still wear underwear.",4,2
chandler,OH MY GOD!!!,4,2
joey,WHAT?!!,4,2
chandler,Are you all right?!,4,2
joey,Yeah...,4,2
chandler,What happened?!!,4,2
joey,"Aww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!",4,2
chandler,What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!,4,2
joey,"Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!",4,2
chandler,So—You got in voluntarily?!,4,2
joey,"I was trying’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m going to do?",4,2
chandler,BEND OVER?!!!,4,2
chip,"...and then Zana, just let one rip!!",4,2
monica,"Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, because I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don’t even know where you work?",4,2
chip,You know where I work!,4,2
monica,I do?,4,2
chip,"The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.",4,2
monica,You still work at the multiplex?,4,2
chip,"Oh, like I’d give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.",4,2
monica,"Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?",4,2
chip,"Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.",4,2
rachel,Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.,4,2
phoebe,"Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.",4,2
joey,"Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!",4,2
monica,Oh my God! What happened?,4,2
chandler,"Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!",4,2
rachel,"So, how was your date?",4,2
monica,"Well, you know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?",4,2
rachel,Um-hmm.,4,2
monica,"Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.",4,2
rachel,"Oh honey, I’m sorry.",4,2
monica,"No, it’s okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.",4,2
rachel,OH! That’s so great!,4,2
monica,I know!,4,2
ross,"Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?",4,2
chandler,"Oh, they said uh, “You don’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.”",4,2
ross,"You didn’t tell her?!  Okay, fine! Pheebs?",4,2
phoebe,Yeah?  Hi!,4,2
ross,"Hi! Listen uh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.",4,2
rachel,"I’m sorry, sweetie.",4,2
monica,"Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.",4,2
phoebe,"OH. Um-hmm. But you know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?",4,2
"chandler, monica, joey, and rachel",That’s a good call. Right.,4,2
ross,"No! No! Look—Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!",4,2
phoebe,"Ross, how many parents have you lost?",4,2
ross,None.,4,2
phoebe,"Okay, then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.",4,2
ross,I’m sorry.,4,2
phoebe,Okay.,4,2
ross,I don’t know what to say.,4,2
rachel,You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.,4,2
phoebe,I think she would like that.,4,2
ross,"Come here, here, come here, come here,  Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother.",4,2
phoebe,Thank you. We both forgive you.,4,2
rachel,"So honey, what are you going to do about the little girl?",4,2
phoebe,"Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.",4,2
chandler,"Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we’d really appreciate it.",4,2
phoebe,"Come on, Mom, I’ll take you home.",4,2
rachel,I’ll go with you.,4,2
monica,Me too.,4,2
ross,"OH! You know, I’ve got an extra futon.",4,2
joey,"Dude, you don’t have to brag! We got nothing here!!",4,2
joey,Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.,4,3
chandler,"Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!",4,3
joey,Huh?!,4,3
chandler,Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!,4,3
joey,"Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!",4,3
chandler,Could we be more white trash?,4,3
monica,How desperate am I?,4,3
rachel,"Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.",4,3
monica,I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.,4,3
phoebe,How come?,4,3
monica,"Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.",4,3
ross,"Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.",4,3
monica,You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you.,4,3
rachel,"Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?",4,3
joey,Just pickle.,4,3
chandler,"Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.",4,3
rachel,"My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward.",4,3
chandler,"Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.",4,3
rachel,"You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?",4,3
chandler,No. No!,4,3
joanna,"Hello, Rachel.",4,3
chandler,"Well, not at first.",4,3
rachel,What is she doing here?,4,3
rachel,"I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’",4,3
chandler,"Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.",4,3
rachel,"Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!",4,3
chandler,"Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.",4,3
rachel,"Chandler!!  Promise me, you will end it.",4,3
chandler,"Okay, I promise, I’ll end it.",4,3
rachel,Thank you.,4,3
chandler,"I hope you know what I’m giving up for you, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.",4,3
joey,"Yeah-eh-eah!  Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.",4,3
mrs. geller,How’s the hired help?,4,3
monica,"Doing great, the quiches are coming along.",4,3
mrs. geller,What’s this? Blue nail polish?,4,3
monica,"Yeah, I thought it was cute.",4,3
mrs. geller,"Ahh, that’s what your Grandmother’s hands looked like when we found her.",4,3
monica,Let me ask you a question.,4,3
mrs. geller,Hmm.,4,3
monica,Why did you hire me?,4,3
mrs. geller,"Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren’t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.",4,3
monica,Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good.,4,3
phoebe,"Okay, I didn’t hear that.",4,3
monica,"Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good.",4,3
phoebe,"Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian!",4,3
the salesman,"Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?",4,3
joey,Uh.,4,3
the salesman,"Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopaedias?",4,3
joey,"No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.",4,3
the salesman,"Actually, I’m not buying. I’m selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you’re not really sure what they’re talking about?",4,3
ross,I’m telling you it’s totally unconstitutional.,4,3
"monica, chandler, phoebe, and rachel","Oh yeah, I totally agree.",4,3
monica,I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.,4,3
all,Nooo!!,4,3
chandler,it was like the Algonquin kids table.,4,3
the salesman,"Excuse me, I’m sorry, you haven’t said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?",4,3
joey,Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.,4,3
phoebe,That’s weird.,4,3
monica,What?,4,3
phoebe,Your nails.,4,3
monica,"Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.",4,3
phoebe,"Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now.",4,3
monica,"Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put…  Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!",4,3
phoebe,"Okay, don’t panic. I’m going to go to the store, I’m going to get you another set of nails, no one’s going to know, and you’re going to look great.  Oh! Oh, it’s because they’re going to eat—that’s the problem.",4,3
mrs. geller,"Honey, don’t bite your nails.",4,3
monica,"Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one.",4,3
phoebe,And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!,4,3
mrs. geller,I’m not freaking out.,4,3
monica,Then why are you laughing?,4,3
mrs. geller,"It’s nothing, it’s just that now your Father owes me five dollars.",4,3
monica,What? You bet I’d lose a nail?,4,3
mrs. geller,"Oh no, don’t be silly. I just bet I’d need these.",4,3
monica,Frozen lasagnas?,4,3
mrs. geller,Um-hmm.,4,3
monica,You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was,4,3
mrs. geller,"No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.",4,3
monica,"You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase.",4,3
mrs. geller,"Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you’ve never been able to laugh at yourself.",4,3
monica,"That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.",4,3
phoebe,I don’t get it.,4,3
mrs. geller,"No, I have faith",4,3
monica,No! You have lasagnas!,4,3
oven,Ding!,4,3
phoebe,"Op, the ruined quiches are ready.",4,3
chandler,It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.,4,3
joanna,"No, we are. I’m sad.",4,3
chandler,Okay.,4,3
joanna,"Yes.  Uh, can’t you wait until tomorrow?  All right.  Unbelievable!!",4,3
chandler,Thanks.,4,3
joanna,"No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.",4,3
chandler,Okay.,4,3
joanna,What are you doing?,4,3
chandler,I’m getting dressed.,4,3
joanna,Why?,4,3
chandler,When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.,4,3
joanna,Wait. I want to show you something.,4,3
chandler,What is it?,4,3
joanna,Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.  Put your hands together.,4,3
chandler,"Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me.  Yeah, you are!  Ooh, saucy.",4,3
joanna,I’ll be back in ten minutes.,4,3
chandler,"You are, you’re going to leave me like this?",4,3
joanna,"Knowing you’re here, waiting for me I think it’s kind of exciting.",4,3
chandler,"Okay. But if you don’t come back soon,  there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!",4,3
joanna,Oh.,4,3
sophie,Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!,4,3
joanna,Oh great! I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose.,4,3
rachel,"That’s weird, she locked the door.",4,3
sophie,You know why? She’s got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.,4,3
rachel,"Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you want to see the list?",4,3
sophie,Yeah!,4,3
chandler,Hi!  How are you?,4,3
chandler,"Hello, Joanna……’s office.",4,3
joanna,I’m really sorry but I may be a little while longer.,4,3
chandler,How little?!,4,3
joanna,"A couple of hours, I feel awful.",4,3
chandler,"Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!",4,3
joanna,I can’t!!,4,3
chandler,Why not?!,4,3
joanna,I’m in my boss’s car!,4,3
chandler,What?!,4,3
joanna,"Uh-oh, tunnel.",4,3
rachel,What?!,4,3
chandler,"Rachel, could I see you for a moment?",4,3
chandler,"Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.",4,3
rachel,You promised you would break up with her!,4,3
chandler,"I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!",4,3
rachel,And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!,4,3
chandler,"It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.",4,3
rachel,"You know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.",4,3
chandler,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and",4,3
rachel,"Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it!  You never see Joanna again!",4,3
chandler,Never!,4,3
rachel,You never come into this office again!,4,3
chandler,Fine!,4,3
rachel,You give me back my Walkman!,4,3
chandler,I—never borrowed your Walkman.,4,3
rachel,"Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!",4,3
chandler,You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great!  Ah!,4,3
rachel,Does it hurt?,4,3
chandler,"No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them.  Hello sweet pants!",4,3
rachel,Wait a minute! What are you going to tell Joanna?,4,3
chandler,About what?,4,3
rachel,"When she sees that you’re gone, she’s going to know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m going to get fired!",4,3
chandler,"I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!",4,3
rachel,"No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s going to know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were!",4,3
chandler,"Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!",4,3
chandler,"Well, this is much better.",4,3
the salesman,"So, here’s somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?",4,3
joey,He cut off his ear.,4,3
the salesman,And?,4,3
joey,I’m out.,4,3
the salesman,He painted that.,4,3
joey,Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear because he sucked. What else you got in there?,4,3
the salesman,"Let’s see, ah… Where does the Pope live?",4,3
joey,"In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer.",4,3
the salesman,"Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?",4,3
joey,Spock’s birth control.,4,3
the salesman,You need these books.,4,3
phoebe,Hey!,4,3
monica,Hi.,4,3
phoebe,This used to be your room?  Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.,4,3
monica,"OH, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.",4,3
phoebe,"Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.",4,3
monica,"Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.",4,3
phoebe,"No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. You know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.",4,3
monica,What?,4,3
phoebe,"Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica. ""you know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""Yeah, that one’s out of here."" Though some things don’t change.",4,3
monica,"All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not going to serve the lasagna. I’m going to serve something I make.",4,3
phoebe,Wow! My breasts are really strong.,4,3
rachel,"Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am so going to lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.",4,3
chandler,"Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s going to know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.",4,3
rachel,What if I clean your bathroom for a month?,4,3
chandler,It still wouldn’t be clean.  All I want is my freedom.,4,3
rachel,Foot rubs for a month!,4,3
chandler,Freedom!,4,3
rachel,I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!,4,3
chandler,"Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?!  Sophie, help me! Help me!!",4,3
rachel,Sophie sit!!,4,3
rachel,"No! God, would you just calm down!",4,3
chandler,I’m going to say this for the last time. Would you please just,4,3
joey,Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit.   In a minute.,4,3
the salesman,"So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopaedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!",4,3
joey,"Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learning’.",4,3
the salesman,"Well ah, what can you swing?",4,3
joey,"How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?",4,3
the salesman,"You don’t have, anything?",4,3
joey,"You want to see what I got?  Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!",4,3
the salesman,"Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.",4,3
joey,"And a 50.  Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants.",4,3
the salesman,"For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?",4,3
joey,"Oh, I-I think I’m going to stick with the V, I want to see how this bad boy turns out.",4,3
rachel,"I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.",4,3
chandler,No!,4,3
rachel,I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!,4,3
chandler,With extra pulp?,4,3
rachel,Yeah!!,4,3
chandler,No!,4,3
rachel,D’oh!!  I’ve got it!,4,3
chandler,You don’t have it.,4,3
rachel,"I have so got it. There’s going to be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.",4,3
chandler,How do Monica and Phoebe know?,4,3
rachel,"Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous  or very  stingy.",4,3
chandler,Go on.,4,3
rachel,I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.,4,3
chandler,And Milton Berle has a,4,3
rachel,"OH, not compared to you.",4,3
monica,Well?,4,3
phoebe,They’re not even touching the lasagna!,4,3
monica,Really?!,4,3
phoebe,"Oh, they love your casserole.",4,3
monica,Yes!!,4,3
phoebe,It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.,4,3
mrs. geller,"Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.",4,3
monica,And you?,4,3
mrs. geller,I thought it was… quite tasty.,4,3
monica,"So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you",4,3
mrs. geller,A bitch?,4,3
monica,"Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.",4,3
mrs. geller,"Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.",4,3
monica,Wow!,4,3
phoebe,"Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica.   She doesn’t know we switched it.",4,3
mrs. geller,"And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.",4,3
monica,"That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails.",4,3
chandler,Hello.,4,3
"joey, rachel, and ross",Hey!,4,3
monica,"Hello, Chandler.",4,3
chandler,I love you.,4,3
joey,Wh-what’s going on?,4,3
phoebe,Oh.,4,3
joey,No he doesn’t!,4,3
chandler,"Two hours, that lasted!",4,3
rachel,So did you break up with Joanna?,4,3
chandler,I think so.,4,3
joey,"Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.",4,3
ross,The volcano?,4,3
joey,"Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.",4,3
rachel,What?!,4,3
joey,"Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.",4,3
monica,Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?,4,3
joey,"Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?",4,3
monica,Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?,4,3
all,"Oh, yeah. Yeah.",4,3
phoebe,"Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.",4,3
ross,With such a sad history.,4,3
chandler,Could there be more Kims?,4,3
joanna,Who’s out there?,4,3
rachel,It’s me! Good morning!,4,3
joanna,"Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?",4,3
rachel,"Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I…  Oh my word!",4,3
joanna,I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.,4,3
rachel,"Oh, yeah! Yeah!",4,3
joanna,You tell your friend Chandler that we’re definitely broken up this time.,4,3
rachel,Okay.,4,3
phoebe,"Hey! New wallet, huh?",4,4
chandler,"Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.",4,4
monica,Rachel!,4,4
rachel,What?,4,4
monica,You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!,4,4
rachel,"Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.",4,4
monica,Have you ever taken out the trash?,4,4
rachel,"Well, I thought you liked doing it.",4,4
monica,Third door on the left.,4,4
rachel,Right!,4,4
rachel,"Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.",4,4
mr. treeger,Hey.,4,4
mr. treeger,What are you doing?,4,4
rachel,Um. Oh! I’m sorry.  It’s a little old but,4,4
mr. treeger,No! You’re clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!,4,4
rachel,I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.,4,4
mr. treeger,"Oh yeah, of course you don’t!",4,4
rachel,No.,4,4
mr. treeger,"Because you’re a little princess! ""Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me…""",4,4
rachel,I didn’t… I never said that.,4,4
mr. treeger,"You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don’t think of someone else for a change?",4,4
rachel,"Okay, I’m sorry.",4,4
monica,God! If you’re going to cry about it!,4,4
joey,"Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?",4,4
rachel,Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.,4,4
joey,I’m going to go down there and teach that guy a lesson.,4,4
monica,"Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it.",4,4
rachel,"That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.",4,4
joey,"All right that’s it, school is in session!",4,4
monica,My God! Is this a gym card?,4,4
chandler,"Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.",4,4
ross,So why don’t you quit?,4,4
chandler,"You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.",4,4
ross,Who is Maria?,4,4
chandler,"Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.",4,4
ross,You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?,4,4
chandler,No!,4,4
ross,So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?,4,4
chandler,"Oh no, you’ll have to come.",4,4
mr. treeger,"Tribbiani! Hold on, I’ll get the plunger.",4,4
joey,"Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you’re going to go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.",4,4
mr. treeger,And tell him what?,4,4
joey,"Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.",4,4
mr. treeger,Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!,4,4
joey,I have actually not heard of that.,4,4
mr. treeger,"Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief. I’m going to call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother’s apartment. Your friends are out of here pal.",4,4
joey,Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know!,4,4
phoebe,"Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!",4,4
monica,What’s the matter?,4,4
phoebe,"Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.",4,4
monica,So do them for free.,4,4
phoebe,"Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.",4,4
ross,They make you take an oath?,4,4
phoebe,"No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.",4,4
chandler,Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?,4,4
phoebe,"No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional.",4,4
rachel,"Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?",4,4
monica,Wow! And you got a pedicure. Your feet are all dressed up.,4,4
chandler,Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!,4,4
monica,You’re going to do some feet flirting’!,4,4
phoebe,I don’t what your talking about.,4,4
ross,Then how do you explain the toe ring?!,4,4
phoebe,Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!,4,4
rachel,Oh! My hero! What happened?,4,4
joey,"Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later.",4,4
monica,"What a minute, what did he say?",4,4
joey,"He said that he wasn’t going to apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he’s going to do is have you evicted—I’ll see you later.",4,4
rachel,What?! You got us evicted!!,4,4
monica,I told you not to go down there!,4,4
joey,Well he made Rachel cry!,4,4
monica,Rachel always cries!,4,4
rachel,That’s not true!,4,4
monica,"Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before!",4,4
joey,"All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.",4,4
rachel,Go!!,4,4
joey,"All right, all right, all right.  I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it.",4,4
ross,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you got to be strong.",4,4
chandler,Yes.  Yes!,4,4
ross,"One more time, ""Hey, don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?""",4,4
chandler,No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!,4,4
ross,Good! That’s good!,4,4
chandler,Okay.   I want to quit the gym.,4,4
gym employee,You want to quit?,4,4
chandler,I want to quit the gym.,4,4
gym employee,You do realize that you won’t have access to our new full service Swedish spa.,4,4
chandler,I want to quit the gym.,4,4
gym employee,"Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters.  Uh, excuse me,  are you a member?",4,4
ross,Me? No.,4,4
gym employee,"Sorry, members only.",4,4
chandler,I want to quit the gym.,4,4
ross,"It’s okay man, be strong.",4,4
gym employee,"So, are you a member of any gym.",4,4
ross,"No! And I’m not going to be, so you can save you little speech.",4,4
gym employee,"Okay, no problem.  Could you come here for a second?",4,4
woman,"Hi, I’m Maria.",4,4
rick,"Wow, you have really pretty feet.",4,4
phoebe,These old things.,4,4
rick,"Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it’s been killing me today.",4,4
phoebe,"You mean the—Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.",4,4
rick,Yeah.,4,4
phoebe,"Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, you know, the muscles in the siadic area can get you know, real  nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.",4,4
rick,"Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.",4,4
phoebe,Oh.,4,4
rick,Ow! Did you just bite me?,4,4
phoebe,No!,4,4
mr. treeger,What?,4,4
joey,"Please don’t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn’t there fault, it was mine.",4,4
mr. treeger,You want me to kick you guys out instead?,4,4
joey,"No you can’t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?",4,4
mr. treeger,You have pets!,4,4
joey,"No-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I’m the chick and Chandler is the duck.",4,4
mr. treeger,"Huh, I would’ve thought it was the other way around.",4,4

chandler,Yeah… Bunny-rabbit.,4,4
joey,"So you ah, ready for our last practice?",4,4

ross,Oh!,4,5
rachel,What was that?,4,5
ross,Monica knows.,4,5
monica,"It's this dumb thing that Ross made up because he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, because it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.",4,5
ross,"Well, I'm going to go get ready,  for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.",4,5

chandler,"I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. You know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person.  No you are not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!",4,5
monica,"Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.",4,5
phoebe,You mean you stole it!  Don't cover your mouth when you do that!,4,5
joey,Hey.,4,5
kathy,We were just talking about you.,4,5
chandler,Really?!,4,5
joey,"Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.",4,5
chandler,Right in there!,4,5
chandler,"99...100! Ready or not, here I come!  All right, let's go over the concept one more time.",4,5

chandler,"OH, umm, you know what, I already ate.",4,5

joey,"Okay, I see what's going on here.",4,5
chandler,You-you do?,4,5
joey,Yeah! You don't like Kathy.,4,5
chandler,You got me.,4,5
joey,"Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?",4,5
chandler,Yeah. Right.,4,5
joey,"Good, and hey! My treat.  But that is only because you are not eating anything, right?",4,5
chandler,Okay.,4,5
monica,Ross isn't here.,4,5

josh,"So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!",4,5
rachel,Yeah!   I am so going to marry that guy.  oh!,4,5
monica,What?,4,5
rachel,I think he's stealing from me.,4,5
monica,Why?,4,5
rachel,Because he's stealing from me!,4,5
phoebe,"Hi! It's me. And soup.  Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.",4,5
rachel,Ughh!,4,5
phoebe,"Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.",4,5
monica,Thank you so much Phoebe.,4,5
phoebe,Sure.,4,5
monica,What are you doing with those?!,4,5
phoebe,"But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.",4,5
monica,"Sorry, Phoebe.",4,5
phoebe,It's okay. How's the soup?,4,5
monica,Umm.,4,5
monica,oh!! Gross!!,4,5
kathy,"Oh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!",4,5
joey,Is she great or what?,4,5
kathy,So? Huh? What do you think?,4,5
chandler,"Oh, she's-she's not really my type.",4,5
kathy,Not your type?! She's gorgeous!,4,5
chandler,You know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. You know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.,4,5
kathy,"Okay. Understanding a little more why you are single. Oh! you know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!",4,5
chandler,"Uhh, no-no thanks.",4,5
kathy,"Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.",4,5
chandler,"Listen, I-I'm going to grab a beer.",4,5
joey,I'll be right back.  What was that?,4,5
chandler,What?,4,5
joey,Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.,4,5
chandler,"Hey, look, what do you want from me?",4,5
joey,"I want you to like her! But if that is too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.",4,5
chandler,I am pretending.,4,5
joey,"Well then, do it better!",4,5
chandler,"Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?  No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, want to-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!",4,5
joey,"Well, that is pretty good. But you might want to tone it down a little.",4,5
ross,"Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that is one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive.  So uhh, I guess you are not going to mom and dad's tonight?",4,5
monica,"No, sorry.",4,5
rachel,Well where's Amanda?,4,5
monica,"Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?",4,5
rachel,"I mean you know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.",4,5
monica,"Ross, cough drops, please?",4,5
ross,At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.,4,5
rachel,"Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.",4,5
ross,You see Amanda and I have a very special...,4,5
monica,You have nothing! you are not even going out! you are her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!,4,5
rachel,"Oh, that is so sad.",4,5
monica,"And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'",4,5
rachel,"Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!",4,5
monica,"that is mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!",4,5
ross,Fine.,4,5
rachel,Sorry.,4,5
ross,Here.   At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.,4,5
rachel,You know...,4,5
phoebe,"Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats.  Does it even work without my sexy voice?",4,5
gunther,I like it.,4,5
phoebe,"Gunther, kiss me.",4,5
gunther,What?,4,5
joey,"Hey!  Now, we're not actually going to be sleeping in her, but do you mind?",4,5
chandler,Can I sleep on your couch?,4,5
phoebe,And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.,4,5
gunther,Rachel?,4,5
rachel,Yeah.,4,5
gunther,I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_,4,5
rachel,No!,4,5
gunther,"Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.",4,5
rachel,Okay.,4,5
gunther,"So umm, are we cool?",4,5
rachel,Okay.,4,5
gunther,I knew you'd understand.,4,5
cheryl,"So, thank you for the delicious dinner.",4,6
ross,you are welcome for a delicious dinner.,4,6
phoebe,Hey what are you guys looking at?,4,6
chandler,Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.,4,6
phoebe,"Yeah, come to papa.",4,6
ross,I know!,4,6
monica,"Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?",4,6
chandler,"Where did you, when did you, how did you...  How did you get a girl like that?",4,6
rachel,"Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?",4,6
ross,"Actually she's a palaeontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.",4,6
chandler,"Okay, but that is, like, the easiest era.",4,6
ross,"I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.",4,6
rachel,Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.,4,6
ross,Fine by me; hope she wins.,4,6
chandler,Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?,4,6
phoebe,Ooh! Is it for my birthday present?,4,6
chandler,"Pheebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.",4,6
phoebe,"Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?",4,6
chandler,"Well, I have a call in about that.",4,6
phoebe,'Kay.,4,6
chandler,"Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favourite book.",4,6
rachel,"Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!",4,6
chandler,"Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.",4,6
rachel,"Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?",4,6
chandler,"Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.",4,6
rachel,"Oh, honey, that is so sweet.",4,6
phoebe,"Yeah, and what a great way to say, ""I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!""",4,6
chandler,It doesn't say that. Does it?,4,6
ross,How do you think it's going to look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?,4,6
chandler,"Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.",4,6
phoebe,It's got to be better than that book. Ooh! Like a crossbow!,4,6
monica,"Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye.  I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.",4,6
rachel,Oh my God! What happened?,4,6
monica,Sixty guests.,4,6
ross,"So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?",4,6
monica,Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.,4,6
phoebe,"Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican...  ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?",4,6
monica,I don't know.,4,6
phoebe,"There you go, that is the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!",4,6
monica,Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.,4,6
phoebe,"Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.",4,6
monica,"Well, you are not working either.",4,6
phoebe,"Yes, but I'm doing this.",4,6
monica,"Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!",4,6
joey,Hey!,4,6
everyone,Hey.,4,6
kathy,Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?,4,6
joey,Why?,4,6
joey,You can pee here!,4,6
kathy,"Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.",4,6
chandler,"It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway.  Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?",4,6
joey,"We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I got to get her something?",4,6
everyone,Yeah!,4,6
rachel,"Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.",4,6
joey,"Oh, I know...",4,6
rachel,"And not one of your coupons for an hour of ""Joey Love.""",4,6
phoebe,"Ooh, a crossword! Can I help?",4,6
rachel,"No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.",4,6
phoebe,Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.,4,6
monica,Hey!,4,6
rachel,"Hey, how'd it go?",4,6
monica,"Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow—the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!",4,6
phoebe,Mon! I'm so happy for you!,4,6
monica,"Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff.  Look at this! I'm an omelette station! Omelette? Made to order!",4,6
phoebe,"I'll have one, please. Plus my money.",4,6
monica,"Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look—I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.",4,6
phoebe,"Oh. Okay. Ooh, sorry I acted like a bank.",4,6
monica,Okay.,4,6
ross,Huh...,4,6
cheryl,"Um, would you like to come in?",4,6
ross,Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?,4,6
cheryl,According to recent findings!,4,6
cheryl,Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!,4,6
ross,Mitzi is.....,4,6
cheryl,"My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.",4,6
ross,"Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh  ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?",4,6
cheryl,What?,4,6
ross,"Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...",4,6
cheryl,I'd rather not.,4,6
ross,"Oh, yeah, why not?",4,6
cheryl,"Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kind of has a weird smell.",4,6
monica,"Oh, is everything in the car?",4,6
phoebe,Yes. Did you settle the bill?,4,6
monica,No. I hate this part.,4,6
phoebe,"Oh, look what we almost left.",4,6
monica,"No, that is not mine.",4,6
phoebe,"Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!",4,6
monica,"Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.",4,6
mrs. burkart,"Oh, good. Thank you.",4,6
monica,"Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...",4,6
mrs. burkart,Dear?,4,6
monica,Just the matter of ...payment?,4,6
mrs. burkart,Jack used to handle the finances!,4,6
rachel,You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.,4,6
chandler,Sure...,4,6
rachel,And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?,4,6
chandler,"I don't know... um, Grease?",4,6
rachel,No....,4,6
chandler,Rent?,4,6
rachel,Yes! Rent!,4,6
chandler,"Okay, so when do you want to go?",4,6
rachel,"What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.",4,6
joey,"Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.",4,6
chandler,"Yes, it is, at Office Max.",4,6
rachel,What did you get her?,4,6
chandler,A pen.,4,6
joey,It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that is also a clock! Huh?,4,6
chandler,Huh-huh! You can't give her that.,4,6
joey,Why not?,4,6
chandler,Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!,4,6
rachel,"Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?",4,6
joey,"Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... ""Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!""",4,6
chandler,"All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?",4,6
joey,She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.,4,6
chandler,For three years?,4,6
joey,"Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...",4,6
chandler,"All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?",4,6
joey,"Thanks, man. And oh, while you are at it, could you get her a card?",4,6
chandler,Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?,4,6
joey,Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.,4,6
phoebe,"But Mon, you have to get our money!",4,6
monica,"Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.",4,6
phoebe,"I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?",4,6
monica,What?,4,6
phoebe,"Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, ""that massage wasn't long enough, or, ""I don't recognize any of those songs,"" or, you know, ""these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!""",4,6
monica,Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?,4,6
phoebe,"Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.",4,6
monica,"Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.",4,6
mrs. burkart,"you are a grand old' flag, you are a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....",4,6
phoebe,She seems fine now.,4,6
mrs. burkart,...emblem of the land I love. The home of....,4,6
joey,"So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?",4,6
ross,You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?,4,6
joey,Yeah.,4,6
ross,"Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!  Here.",4,6
joey,"Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?",4,6
ross,What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.,4,6
joey,"All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.",4,6
ross,"No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.",4,6
joey,What kind of smell?,4,6
ross,I don't know. Soap?,4,6
joey,"All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?",4,6
ross,Yeah.,4,6
joey,"You want to see her again, right?",4,6
ross,Yeah.,4,6
joey,So you are going to have to do it in the mess!,4,6
ross,"Yeah, okay you are right.",4,6
joey,Yeah.,4,6
ross,"I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?",4,6
joey,Yeah!,4,6
ross,"It's, uh... it's endearing, really.",4,6
joey,All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig!  Oink!,4,6
chandler,"Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.",4,6
rachel,Any luck?,4,6
chandler,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called ""Invisible things for Kathy.""  Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?",4,6
rachel,"All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.",4,6
chandler,"She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.",4,6
rachel,"Aw, honey, that is so sweet.",4,6
chandler,Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?,4,6
rachel,Oh! Pathetic!,4,6
joey,Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!,4,6
chandler,Where?,4,6
joey,"Our place, the hall! I...",4,6
chandler,I got something for her.  It's a book!,4,6
joey,A book?  Is it like a book that is also a safe?,4,6
chandler,"No, it's a book that is just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favourite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?",4,6
joey,"You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one.  Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?",4,6
chandler,"No, it came out to an even twenty.",4,6
joey,Wow. that is almost as much as a new book.,4,6
mrs. burkart,"Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?",4,6
phoebe,"You didn't get the money, did you?",4,6
monica,"Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!",4,6
phoebe,"No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough!  Hey, widow?",4,6
mrs. burkart,Come on along and listen to...,4,6
phoebe,"Okay, Widow!",4,6
mrs. burkart,...the lullaby of...,4,6
phoebe,"Excuse me. Excuse me!  Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. Because you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.",4,6
mrs. burkart,All right. I'll get my bag.,4,6
phoebe,Good.,4,6
monica,I'm going to leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.,4,6
cheryl,So you want to come inside?,4,6
ross,Yes. Yes I do.,4,6
cheryl,I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.,4,6
cheryl,Guess who?,4,6
ross,Department of Sanitation?,4,6
cheryl,It's me!,4,6
ross,Oh!  Ah.  Aw!,4,6
cheryl,What?,4,6
ross,"Ah, Cheryl!",4,6
cheryl,"Oh, Ross!",4,6
cheryl,Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!,4,6
ross,"Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.",4,6
cheryl,"Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.",4,6
rachel,I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!,4,6
gunther,Move!,4,6
rachel,"Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!",4,6
phoebe,Uh... yay!,4,6
rachel,Thanks!,4,6
monica,"Oh, that is great! Congratulations!",4,6
rachel,"Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?",4,6
monica,"Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.",4,6
phoebe,Yeah. I'm a hard ass.,4,6
monica,And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.,4,6
phoebe,Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!,4,6
monica,"Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! you are not working right now, and we have such a great time together!",4,6
phoebe,Okay!,4,6
monica,I can cook and you can take care of the money.,4,6
phoebe,Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!,4,6
both,Aah!,4,6
joey,Hey!,4,6
chandler,"Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?",4,6
joey,"Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.",4,6
chandler,Oh yeah? that is great!,4,6
joey,"Hey, listen, I got to tell you, I feel kind of bad taking credit for this, because man, am I going to get a lot of credit for this!",4,6
chandler,Aahhuuhhh....,4,6
kathy,Hey.,4,6
joey,Hey!,4,6
chandler,Hey! Happy birthday.,4,6
kathy,Thank you!,4,6

joey,"Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!",4,6
chandler,Happy birthday! I'm sorry.,4,6
kathy,You really didn't have to.  Wow.,4,6
chandler,"See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.",4,6
kathy,"Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .",4,6
chandler,"Oh, yeah... yeah.",4,6
joey,Ah. Hm.  want to go to bed?,4,6
kathy,I'll be in in a minute.,4,6
joey,"Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .",4,6
chandler,Goodnight.,4,6
kathy,"Um, thank you for the gift.",4,6
chandler,"Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you are writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.",4,6
kathy,"No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.",4,6
chandler,"Uh, the book?",4,6
kathy,The Velveteen Rabbit. I kind of have the feeling you had something to do with it.,4,6
chandler,What do you mean?,4,6
kathy,"Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, ""This is Because I know you like Rabbits, and I know you like cheese."" Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.",4,6
chandler,"Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, ""Uhl, ell.""",4,6
kathy,You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.,4,6
chandler,"Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.",4,6
kathy,Well....,4,6
chandler,Goodnight.,4,6
joey,"Hey, that coupon expires, you know.",4,6
monica,"Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.",4,6
cheryl,"Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that is too bad that didn't work out.",4,6
monica,"Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?",4,6
monica,No?,4,6
chandler,I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!,4,7
ross,"You know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise.",4,7
chandler,"It just keeps getting worse and worse! You know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth! Smooth!",4,7
phoebe,Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?,4,7
all,Yeah! Oh my God!,4,7
casey,Here you go.,4,7
joey,"Great! All right, so I’ll call you later.",4,7
casey,Great!,4,7
chandler,Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?,4,7
joey,That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight.,4,7
chandler,"Going’ out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.",4,7
joey,"No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.",4,7
chandler,What?,4,7
joey,Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!,4,7
chandler,Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!,4,7
joey,Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?,4,7
chandler,"Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.",4,7
joey,What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.,4,7
chandler,"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.",4,7
joey,You got all that from the back of her head?,4,7
chandler,"All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. You know? Make a choice, pick a lane.",4,7
joey,Who’s Elaine?,4,7
phoebe,"""Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease…"" Darn it! Now, I don’t know who to get to the next verse.",4,7
ross,"Oh, you could just go uh, ""greatest of ease…  BAH-bah-bha-bhannn."" Then go right into it.",4,7
phoebe,"Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’",4,7
ross,"Well umm, you know, I used to play.",4,7
phoebe,"Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?",4,7
ross,"Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound.",4,7
monica,"Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.",4,7
ross,Yeah.,4,7
monica,"He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, ""The Sound.""",4,7
phoebe,"I want to hear ""The Sound.""",4,7
ross,"Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well it’s-it’s really personal stuff, you know?",4,7
phoebe,"Come on, play that funky music white boy.",4,7
monica,Yeah!,4,7
ross,"No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in—No, yeah, okay.",4,7
ross,"Okay, guys.",4,7
chandler,"All right! Bring it on, you",4,7
ross,"Here we go.  You know, I’ve-I’ve never played my stuff for anyone before, so it’s important that-that you understand it’s about communicating very private emotions.  You know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That’s what I’m",4,7
chandler,Oh my God! Play!,4,7
monica,"Boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific.",4,7
chandler,"Really, bitchin’!",4,7
phoebe,"Wow, it was so—wow!",4,7
ross,"Really?! I mean, really?!!",4,7
rachel,"Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!",4,7
ross,"Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—oh, I want to, I want to play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be right back! Okay?  This is so nice, I’m—I am so",4,7
monica,Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!,4,7
rachel,"Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.",4,7
phoebe,"What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was so moving. Oh, plus it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.",4,7
chandler,"You mean like, music?",4,7
chandler,"Yeah, I know what you’re thinking’! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.",4,7
chandler,Come in!,4,7
kathy,"Hey!  Oh God, is that Baywatch?",4,7
chandler,"Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.",4,7
kathy,So is Joey around?,4,7
chandler,"No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?",4,7
kathy,"I uh, don’t really have a preference. You?",4,7
chandler,I like it in the stern.  …of the boat.   Hello.,4,7
joey,"Hey, it’s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.",4,7
chandler,What happened?,4,7
joey,"We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as soon as I can.",4,7
chandler,Why can’t you tell her?,4,7
joey,"Because I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to—",4,7
chandler,Joey! Joey!!,4,7
joey,Yeah?,4,7
chandler,I thought your time ran out.,4,7
joey,"Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more—",4,7
chandler,"Uhh, that was Joey. He’s running a little late, he says he’s sorry.",4,7
kathy,Oh.,4,7
chandler,"So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then.",4,7
kathy,"Oh, okay.",4,7
chandler,"Yeah, I think it is!",4,7
kathy,So what did you do today?,4,7
chandler,"Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut",4,7
kathy,"Oh, it looks great!",4,7
chandler,and then it got cancelled.,4,7
kathy,"Well, I could cut it.",4,7
chandler,Really?! You do that?,4,7
kathy,"Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt’s dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?",4,7
chandler,"Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy.",4,7
kathy,You have really great hair.,4,7
chandler,"Well, thanks. I grow it myself.  You know who also has great hair is Joey!",4,7

chandler,What?,4,7
joey,"Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.",4,7

chandler,Okay!,4,7
kathy,"No, but that’s bad!",4,7
chandler,"Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.",4,7
kathy,What?!,4,7
chandler,"Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?",4,7
kathy,Can you really do that?,4,7
chandler,"I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him.",4,7
kathy,"Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you",4,7
chandler,"Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see, you’re getting me confused, I’m starting to urn.",4,7
kathy,"I’m sorry. If you want to pretend that nothing happened, I can try.",4,7
chandler,I-I think we have too.,4,7
kathy,Okay. Bye.,4,7
chandler,Bye.  Are you still out there?,4,7
kathy,No.,4,7
ross,Electrifying.  Emphatic time-time-time,4,7

monica,"Hey, aren’t you up next?",4,7
phoebe,"Oh no, I’m not playing tonight.",4,7
rachel,Why not?,4,7
phoebe,I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.,4,7
monica,"Phoebe, Ross sucks!",4,7
rachel,"Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.",4,7
phoebe,"Oh my God, he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!",4,7
monica,"Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.",4,7
rachel,"Yeah, Phoebe you’re… awful!",4,7
phoebe,You guys. You suck too.,4,7
joey,Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again!,4,7
chandler,Hang on buddy!,4,7
joey,Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?,4,7
chandler,I sure did.,4,7
joey,Why?,4,7
chandler,"Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.",4,7
joey,"Well, you’re amazing.",4,7
chandler,Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.,4,7
joey,"A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?",4,7
chandler,"Well, you know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.",4,7
joey,"Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.",4,7
chandler,"Oh, I don’t know.",4,7
joey,"Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m going to do that.",4,7
chandler,You mean with Casey.,4,7
joey,"No-no-no, I think I’m going to see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.",4,7
chandler,Or Casey.,4,7
joey,"No-no, Kathy.",4,7
chandler,Could be Casey.,4,7
joey,"No. No, Kathy.",4,7
chandler,Consider Casey.,4,7
joey,you know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?,4,7
chandler,That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!,4,7
ross,Hey!,4,7
phoebe,"Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!",4,7
ross,"Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to play anymore because me and you know my talent. Is that true?",4,7
phoebe,"Well, kind of. Yeah. Yeah.",4,7
ross,Pheebs,4,7
phoebe,"Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean you know I was trying to be really you know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I",4,7
ross,"See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. you know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I… I won’t play anymore.",4,7
phoebe,"Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.",4,7
ross,"Yeah, okay.",4,7
ross,Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.,4,7
monica,Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!,4,7
chandler,I kissed Kathy.,4,7
ross,What?,4,7
monica,Are you serious?,4,7
phoebe,Does Joey know?,4,7
chandler,"No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll understand this?",4,7
monica,You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends.  Which we all appreciate.,4,7
ross,"No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.",4,7
chandler,"Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?",4,7
phoebe,"I think maybe, yeah.",4,7
monica,He loves you.,4,7
chandler,Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!,4,7
ross,"Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.",4,7
phoebe,"Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.",4,7
rachel,"I know, I remember that!",4,7
monica,I remember you did.,4,7
chandler,God!!  What am I going to do?!,4,7
rachel,"Well, Chandler, you’re going to have to tell him.",4,7
chandler,Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!,4,7
rachel,Because you do.,4,7
chandler,"Yeah, I know.",4,7
ross,"Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.",4,7
chandler,Hey!,4,7
joey,Hey! Samboucha Margarita?,4,7
chandler,Is that a real thing?,4,7
joey,"Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.",4,7
chandler,"Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.",4,7
joey,What’s up?,4,7
chandler,"It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.",4,7
joey,You do?,4,7
chandler,Yeah.,4,7
joey,"Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my girlfriend anymore.",4,7
chandler,What?,4,7
joey,"Yeah, she broke up with me.",4,7
chandler,"Oh uh, when?",4,7
joey,"Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that’s why I let people watch.",4,7
chandler,"Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?",4,7
joey,"Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?",4,7
chandler,"Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too.",4,7
joey,"No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay.",4,7
chandler,Yeah?,4,7
joey,Yeah. You know why? because you came to me first.,4,7
chandler,"Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.",4,7
joey,"But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out for you. because when I talked to her, I kind of got the feeling that she’s into some other guy. So",4,7
chandler,"See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.",4,7
joey,Who?,4,7
chandler,It’s me. I’m the other guy.,4,7
joey,What?,4,7
chandler,"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and",4,7
joey,And what?! Did you sleep with her?!,4,7
chandler,No! No! No! I just kissed her.,4,7
joey,What?!! That’s even worse!!,4,7
chandler,How is that worse?!,4,7
joey,I don’t know! But it’s the same!,4,7
chandler,"Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think I’m in love with her!",4,7
joey,Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!,4,7
chandler,"You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.",4,7
joey,"Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!",4,7
chandler,Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!,4,7
joey,"Is that why you bought all this stuff?!  Well, you know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I’m not going to eat! You know why?!",4,7
chandler,Probably because,4,7
joey,"Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either.  Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.",4,7
phoebe,"Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.",4,7
monica,What?,4,7
rachel,"Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.",4,7
ross,"Thank you, thanks.  Yeah, I lost it. you know, I’m not going to play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?",4,7
phoebe,"After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.",4,7
ross,"Yeah, like I could lose it.",4,7
rachel,What?,4,7
ross,I played bad on purpose guys.,4,7
monica,"Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.",4,7
ross,"Yeah—no, just that last song.",4,7
joey,Hello.,4,8
chandler,"Hey, it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I",4,8
joey,Hello.,4,8
chandler,"Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I’m",4,8
joey,Stop calling’!!,4,8
voice,"Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.",4,8
joey,All right!,4,8
voice,"What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything",4,8
chandler,"Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!",4,8
phoebe,"Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!",4,8
rachel,So are things with you and Joey any better?,4,8
chandler,"They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.",4,8
rachel,"Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?",4,8
ross,Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?,4,8
rachel,You shouldn’t.,4,8
phoebe,"Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.",4,8
ross,Who gets whom.  I don’t know why I do that.,4,8
rachel,"Well, I’m going to take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.",4,8
monica,We haven’t eaten yet!,4,8
rachel,"I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just",4,8
chandler,"Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, because I want to trade for her.",4,8
phoebe,I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!,4,8
chandler,Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?,4,8
phoebe,"Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!",4,8
chandler,"Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it…  Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it…  Her initials",4,8
phoebe,Ohh.,4,8
monica,"Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.",4,8
chandler,"Op, you know what though, it’s kind of a girlie briefcase.",4,8
monica,Who cares? He works in a museum!,4,8
chandler,"Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!",4,8
phoebe,"You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you can watch the parade if you want.",4,8
chandler,Thanks.,4,8
monica,What is wrong with this freezer?!  Ow! Ow!!,4,8
phoebe,"God, what happened?!",4,8
monica,"Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!",4,8
rachel,People are trying to sleep in here!,4,8
chandler,"Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.",4,8
phoebe,"Open it up, let me see.",4,8
monica,"Oh, you know what, I can’t, it really kills.",4,8
chandler,Well maybe you should put some ice on it.,4,8
phoebe,"Ooh, God it looks bad.",4,8
rachel,"Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.",4,8
monica,"No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!",4,8
chandler,He’s really picky about his patients.,4,8
phoebe,"Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?",4,8
monica,Like I remember his office number!  Speed dial 7.,4,8
phoebe,"Hi! Yeah, I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today.   He’s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?",4,8
monica,Yes!!,4,8
phoebe,Yes! She’s very excited about that.,4,8
phoebe,"This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions.",4,8
ross,"Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!",4,8
phoebe,"Okay, get out of my kitchen!",4,8
chandler,"All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once!  I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.",4,8
phoebe,All right I… I got to call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.,4,8
ross,"So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you want to switch.",4,8
chandler,"Oh you know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.",4,8
ross,"Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you going to get me?",4,8
chandler,"I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.",4,8
ross,"Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.",4,8
chandler,"Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re going to get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.",4,8
ross,"Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.",4,8
chandler,Like?,4,8
ross,"Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.",4,8
chandler,When was the last time you saw her wear it?,4,8
ross,"Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh",4,8
chandler,Big dog?,4,8
ross,Hey!,4,8
joey,Hey!,4,8
ross,What are you doing?,4,8
joey,I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.,4,8
ross,Everything? Even the TV?,4,8
joey,No! I’m putting that in my room.,4,8
ross,"Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?",4,8
joey,"Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?",4,8
ross,"That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you going to punish him?",4,8
joey,Five years.,4,8
ross,You’ve sentenced him?!,4,8
joey,Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.,4,8
ross,"Joey, the guy’s your best friend.",4,8
joey,"No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.",4,8
ross,"Oh, who? Me?",4,8
joey,Yeah!,4,8
ross,Wow! I’m honoured! And you know what I’m going to do as my first act as your best friend?,4,8
joey,What?,4,8
ross,I’m going to get you to talk to Chandler.,4,8
joey,All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.,4,8
kathy,"Oh my God, is it really that bad?",4,8
chandler,"I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.",4,8
joey,"Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?",4,8
gunther,"I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.",4,8
kathy,Oh.,4,8
chandler,Hey Joe.,4,8
joey,,4,8
doctor,"I’ll be right with you. Okay?  Thanks, Wendy.",4,8
monica,Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?,4,8
rachel,"Ooh, so cute, that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.",4,8
nurse,Dr. Burke will see you know.,4,8
monica,"Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.",4,8
nurse,"Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.",4,8
dr. timothy burke,Ready?,4,8
chandler,Hey! I’m sorry! That— where are you going?,4,8
joey,My folks.,4,8
chandler,"Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?",4,8
joey,I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.,4,8
chandler,What?!,4,8
joey,"Yeah, you know at first I thought we could talk about this you know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I",4,8
chandler,"Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?",4,8
joey,"Look, it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend. So, I’ll see you.",4,8
chandler,"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!",4,8
joey,Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.,4,8
chandler,"All right look, if you’re not going to stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!",4,8
joey,"When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!",4,8
chandler,What?,4,8
joey,"Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were going to turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!",4,8
chandler,"All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.  What?",4,8
joey,We’ve got a box.,4,8
tim,"Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.",4,8
monica,I was probably waiting for it to open.,4,8
tim,"I got to tell you, you look great now.",4,8
monica,You look great too.,4,8
tim,You’re an excellent patient!,4,8
monica,So how does it look?,4,8
tim,"Well, you’ve got a little scratch on your cornea, your going to have to wear a patch for a couple of days.",4,8
monica,Like a pirate?!,4,8
tim,If that helps you.,4,8
monica,"Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad?  Come on, one of us had to mention him.",4,8
tim,I moved back here a couple of months ago.,4,8
monica,Oh. Big family dinner tonight?,4,8
tim,Uh.,4,8
monica,No way!,4,8
tim,I was going to have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend’s.,4,8
monica,Oh.,4,8
tim,But we broke up.,4,8
monica,Oh.,4,8
tim,She-she wasn’t ready for a serious commitment.,4,8
monica,"Oh.  So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?",4,8
tim,You’re not wearing the patch yet.,4,8
monica,I know.,4,8
ross,He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!,4,8
rachel,"I know, it’s sick.",4,8
monica,Why is it sick?,4,8
rachel,Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!,4,8
monica,"Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?",4,8
phoebe,"Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’m sorry, but I think it’s twisted.",4,8
ross,Yeah.,4,8
joey,What’s twisted?,4,8
monica,Me going out with Richard’s son.,4,8
joey,Eww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!,4,8
chandler,Sounds like a really bad idea to me.,4,8
rachel,Is he okay in there?,4,8
joey,He’s fine!,4,8
ross,"Hey, you know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.",4,8
monica,"Fine! Judge all you want to but,  married a lesbian,  left a man at the altar,  fell in love with a gay ice dancer,  threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire,  living’ in a box!!",4,8
rachel,"So now, what exactly is the point of the box?",4,8
joey,Chandler?,4,8
chandler,"The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!",4,8
ross,"Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?",4,8
rachel,Why?,4,8
ross,I just want to check something.,4,8
rachel,Okay.,4,8
ross,"Now, we’ll see.",4,8
chandler,Air hole! Air hole!!,4,8
rachel,Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.,4,8
ross,"The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.",4,8
rachel,"Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.",4,8
ross,Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!,4,8
rachel,Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?,4,8
ross,What did you get?,4,8
rachel,Credit.,4,8
monica,"I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it!  Hi, Tim.",4,8

rachel,"Ooh, I like those sunglasses.",4,8
ross,"Like ‘them, like ‘them? Or, I’d like to get store credit for that amount like ‘them?",4,8
rachel,,4,8
monica,"All right everybody, this turkey is ready!",4,8
tim,Where can I wash up?,4,8
monica,"Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.",4,8
tim,Thank you.,4,8
rachel,Fancy soap? I thought we were saving’ that for the Pope!,4,8
monica,See he’s nice. Right?,4,8
phoebe,"Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, ""That’s not how your dad used to do it.""",4,8
tim,Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?,4,8
monica,I saved you a seat.,4,8
rachel,Sick-sick-sick-sick.,4,8
phoebe,"Oh, I’ll get it.",4,8
chandler,Gotcha!,4,8
joey,That doesn’t sound like thinking to me!,4,8
chandler,Sorry!,4,8
joey,you know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!,4,8
chandler,"Okay, okay, you got it!",4,8
rachel,"Ross, can you pass me the yams?",4,8
ross,"Sure! Oh, and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.",4,8
rachel,Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!,4,8
monica,"Oh-ho-ho, we’ve got company.",4,8
ross,"There’s nothing the matter with me. See, I’m not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.",4,8
rachel,"Okay, fine.",4,8
chandler,"You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!",4,8
joey,"All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!",4,8
chandler,"You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight.",4,8
joey,So are you going to start taking this thing seriously?,4,8
chandler,Absolutely!,4,8
joey,That sounds like another word to me! Are you going to take this seriously?  Okay.,4,8
rachel,"Don’t say that I have no sentiment!  This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed!  This is from the museum from the first time we… were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!",4,8
ross,"I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry. Though, you’re not supposed to take these.  It’s like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.",4,8
monica,"Ooh, this always happens.",4,8
tim,"Here, let me help.",4,8
monica,Thank you.,4,8
tim,You-you have a very beautiful… eye.,4,8
monica,you know all my friends think this is weird.,4,8
tim,"you know I-I thought it was going to be weird, I mean I almost called and cancelled, but it really isn’t.",4,8
monica,"I know! I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally separate thing.",4,8
tim,"Oh, I totally agree.",4,8
monica,We’re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?,4,8
tim,What?,4,8
monica,Nothing. Nothing.,4,8
tim,"No-no really, was-was that not okay?",4,8
monica,"No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a good kiss",4,8
tim,Oh my God! It didn’t remind you of,4,8
monica,Don’t say it!,4,8
tim,"No, but it did! Didn’t it?!",4,8
monica,Yeah!,4,8
tim,Oh man!!,4,8
monica,I know!,4,8
joey,I’ll get it.,4,8
kathy,Oh.,4,8
joey,Hey.,4,8
kathy,"Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am",4,8
joey,That’s okay. Chandler’s the one I’m mad at.,4,8
kathy,"Well, I’m still sorry. Is he here?",4,8
joey,In the box.,4,8
kathy,Chandler?,4,8
phoebe,"Oh, he-he can’t talk right now.",4,8
kathy,Why not? What’s going on?,4,8
phoebe,He’s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.,4,8
kathy,By being in a box?,4,8
rachel,"Joey, had reasons.",4,8
phoebe,They were threefold.,4,8
kathy,"Oh. Well uh,  you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm…  Listen I don’t want to be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can’t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don’t want to be the cause of that. So, I don’t think we can see each other anymore. I’m going to go to my mom’s in Chicago, I’m going to stay there for awhile. I think this could’ve be something really amazing, but you know this is probably for the best. you know? I’m going to miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.",4,8
joey,Open the box!!,4,8
rachel,What?!,4,8
joey,"He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there!  Get out of there!",4,8
chandler,So?,4,8
joey,"Yeah, we’re going to be fine! Get out!",4,8
chandler,Yeah?,4,8
joey,"Yeah, you did some real good thinking’ in there.",4,8
chandler,"Man, this is",4,8
joey,Now go! because you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you’re secret Santa!,4,8
joey,"All right, who got Chandler? because I uh, need to trade.",4,8
rachel,"Oh, he sees her!",4,8
monica,"Oh, he’s catching up to her!",4,8
phoebe,"Oh, she sees him! Oh, they’re hugging!",4,8
ross,He’s taking her purse!,4,8
joey,"Uhh, that’s not them. I’m going to go call the police.",4,8
phoebe,"Oh, there they are!",4,8
phoebe,"All right, get a room.",4,8
phoebe,Okay!,4,9
monica,"Come on, no peeking!",4,9
chandler,Our eyes are closed and we’re about to cross the street. Very good.,4,9
phoebe,"Okay, open up!",4,9
ross,What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!,4,9
phoebe,"Yeah, it’s for our catering business!",4,9
joey,I think I know that girl.,4,9
monica,"All right, umm, we’re not going to really keep it this way though.",4,9
rachel,No?,4,9
phoebe,"No, we’re going to paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.",4,9
rachel,Oh!,4,9
phoebe,"And also, we don’t know what to do with this.",4,9
joey,"Oh yeah, I definitely know her.",4,9
monica,Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?,4,9
phoebe,"Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.",4,9
monica,"Well, I’m going to fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.",4,9
monica,"Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of people.",4,9
phoebe,"How could you say yes, what about our catering business?",4,9
monica,"Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.",4,9
all,Yay!!,4,9
phoebe,"Oh, in that case——Yay!  That was me hopping on board.",4,9
monica,Oh.,4,9
chandler,"Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for you. Are you ready to party?",4,9
ross,"I don’t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there’s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.",4,9
chandler,"No-no, I don’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!",4,9
ross,No!! Gandalf?! Gandalf is coming to town?,4,9
chandler,"Kathy’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandalf dude!",4,9
ross,"Dude, we are so going to party!",4,9
phoebe,"Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?",4,9
ross,"Mike ""Gandalf"" Ganderson, only like the funnest guy in the world.",4,9
chandler,I’m going to call and get off work tomorrow!,4,9
ross,I’m going to call after you!,4,9
chandler,"This is going to be so cool, dude, we never party anymore!",4,9
chandler and ross,Woooo!!!,4,9
monica,"All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?",4,9
joey,"Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?",4,9
ross,"Joey, you are going to love this guy. Gandalf is like the party wizard!",4,9
joey,"Well, why do you call him Gandalf?",4,9
ross,Gandalf the wizard.  Hello! Didn’t you read Lord of the Rings in high school?,4,9
joey,"No, I had sex in high school.",4,9
rachel,"Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss",4,9
joanna,"Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.",4,9
rachel,"Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and",4,9
joanna,"Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can’t stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.",4,9
rachel,"God, I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn’t even consider applying.",4,9
joanna,"Really? Well, in that case",4,9
rachel,And that’s I’m so glad… there’s no problem.,4,9
joanna,"That’s fine, actually I’m on the hiring committee, so there’ll be at least one friendly face.",4,9
rachel,OH! That’s great!,4,9
joanna,"You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.",4,9
rachel,Really?!,4,9
joanna,"No-ho-ho!  Yeah.  I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don’t you worry, I’m sure with your qualifications you won’t need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.",4,9
rachel,"Well, I, umm",4,9
joanna,"Kidding! God, I feel wild today!",4,9
chandler,Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!,4,9
joey,"Will you calm down, he’s just a human guy.",4,9
chandler,"Look you don’t understand, Gandalf is amazing. you know you’re never know what’s going to end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!",4,9
joey,Really?!,4,9
chandler,"Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there.",4,9
ross,"Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!",4,9
chandler,It’s not going to be exactly like last time.,4,9
joey,"All right, I’ll see you guys.",4,9
chandler and ross,Whoa-whoa-whoa!,4,9
chandler,Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!,4,9
joey,"I have an audition, but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you going to be around noon?",4,9
ross,Somewhere maybe along the equator?,4,9
joey,Okay.,4,9
chandler,"Hello.   It’s Gandalf!!!  So, are you in town?   Oh, well, well maybe next time then.",4,9
ross,What happened?,4,9
chandler,"He’s not going to make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.",4,9
ross,"OH, man! Chicago, is so lucky!",4,9
chandler,"Stupid, useless Canadian money!",4,9
mr. posner,"You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.",4,9
rachel,Thank you.,4,9
joanna,Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little coloured labels you put on all the folders?  It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.,4,9
rachel,"Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.",4,9
mrs. lynch,I notice that you’ve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.,4,9
rachel,"Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.",4,9
joanna,Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It’s amazing how she gets it right almost every time!,4,9
rachel,"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",4,9
joanna,"Oh yes, well there’s the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!",4,9
mr. posner,"Yes, that’s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.",4,9
rachel,"Yes, I realize that",4,9
joanna,"And Rachel shouldn’t have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.",4,9
rachel,I love working with designers!,4,9
joanna,"With them, under them, what’s the difference? Eh, Rach?",4,9
monica,Hey! My first review is out!,4,9
phoebe,"OH! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, oh, this used to keep me so warm.",4,9
monica,"All right, look at my on the back page.",4,9
phoebe,"Oh, okay!  ""Would I go back to Allesandro’s? Sure, but I’d have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head.""  Wow! You really laid into this place.",4,9
monica,"Hey, they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends.",4,9
phoebe,"Ooh, I got to go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.",4,9
monica,Oh! Do you need me to go with you?,4,9
phoebe,"No-no, it’s okay. But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed?",4,9
monica,Haven’t we made this decision?,4,9
phoebe,"Yeah, all right.",4,9
monica,Bye!,4,9
phoebe,Bye!,4,9
monica,Who is it?,4,9
allesandro,"It’s Allesandro, from Allesandro’s.",4,9
monica,Oh my God.,4,9
allesandro,I want to talk to you about your review.,4,9
monica,"Oh my God, oh my God.  Call me on the phone!",4,9
allesandro,Why? So you could hang up on me?,4,9
monica,"Look, I-I’m never going to let you up so you may as well just go away.",4,9
allesandro,Just give me a chance too,4,9
phoebe,"Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.",4,9
monica,No! Phoebe!,4,9
phoebe,"Hey, Monica!",4,9
allesandro,I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!,4,9
monica,"I couldn’t eat it! I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and one of them eats books.",4,9
allesandro,Well our service is not grossly incompetent.,4,9
monica,The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!,4,9
allesandro,"Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!",4,9
monica,"All right, that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.",4,9
allesandro,"Hey! I’m proud of that sauce, it’s delicious.",4,9
monica,Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?,4,9
allesandro,Lebanon.,4,9
monica,"Hand me those tomatoes, I’m going to show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.",4,9
allesandro,How long is this going to take? Because I got another critic to go yell at.,4,9
rachel,"Umm, Joanna? I want to talk about that interview.",4,9
joanna,I thought it went very well.,4,9
rachel,"No! It didn’t! That’s what I want to talk to you about.  Now, just to brief you…  I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.",4,9
joanna,"Rachel, please, don’t make a scene.",4,9
rachel,There’s nobody here!,4,9
joanna,"Sophie, get in here!  You see! Now you’re making Sophie uncomfortable!",4,9
sophie,She’s not making me uncomfortable.,4,9
joanna,Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.,4,9
rachel,Do you want me to quit?,4,9
joanna,What?! What would make you think that?,4,9
rachel,"Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. you know what? I am just going to pack up my desk,  and I will be gone by the end of the day!  Well, I guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day!",4,9
joanna,"Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it’s drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn’t want to lose a perfectly good assistant.",4,9
rachel,What?,4,9
joanna,That’s why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking,4,9
rachel,My drinking?,4,9
joanna,"Oh, I must’ve said that after you left.",4,9
rachel,Said what? Exactly.,4,9
joanna,That you enjoyed the occasional drink…ing binge.,4,9
rachel,"Oh my God!! OH, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible person!",4,9
joanna,"Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you’re going to get all sensitive about it! I don’t want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I’ll make you an assistant buyer in this department.",4,9
rachel,Say more things like that.,4,9
joanna,"You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.",4,9
rachel,I’d need an expense account.,4,9
joanna,Done!,4,9
rachel,And an assistant.,4,9
joanna,"Sophie, get in here!",4,9
joey,Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you’d be out partying with Gandel-worf.,4,9
ross,"It’s Gandalf, and he’s not coming.",4,9
joey,So you’ve been sitting’ around here all morning’?,4,9
ross,No! I balanced my check book.,4,9
chandler,"Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.",4,9
ross,I can’t believe he didn’t come!,4,9
joey,So what if he didn’t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!,4,9
chandler,"Oh-no, you know with Gandalf we’d be out all night!",4,9
ross,"Yeah! We’d meet, we’d meet total strangers, and hang out with them!",4,9
joey,"Well, we could do that!",4,9
ross,There’s other stuff too.,4,9
joey,"We’ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandalf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!",4,9
ross,Yeah!,4,9
joey,Yeah!,4,9
ross,Yeah!!,4,9
joey,Yeah!!,4,9
ross,It’s not like we don’t know how to party!!,4,9
joey,Yeah! All right? Let’s go!,4,9
chandler,And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?,4,9
joey and ross,Yeah!!!,4,9
chandler,All right!!,4,9
ross,"Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?",4,9
chandler,"Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?",4,9
ross,Yeah.,4,9
chandler,"Well, those were seals, man.",4,9
rachel,"Hey Mon, little question for you! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?",4,9
monica,"Okay, the owner of Allesandro’s came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!",4,9
rachel,"Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I’m so happy!",4,9
monica,Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!,4,9
rachel,"OH, you’ve waited so long.",4,9
phoebe,Hey!,4,9
rachel,"Hey, Pheebs, quick question for you.",4,9
phoebe,Yeah.,4,9
rachel,How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?,4,9
phoebe,"I don’t know, it would totally depend on her colouring and…  You got the job!!",4,9
rachel,Yes!!!,4,9
monica,You got the job?! Why didn’t you tell me?,4,9
rachel,"OH, it’s going to be so great! I’m going to get to help decide what we sell, I’m going to have an office with walls and everything.  I’m going to have walls!",4,9
phoebe,"Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.",4,9
monica,"OH! Umm, Phoebe, I kind of need to talk to you about that.  Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.",4,9
phoebe,But we’ve only had one job.,4,9
monica,"I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it’s snowballing, you know?",4,9
phoebe,Yeah! What are you saying?,4,9
monica,I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro’s.,4,9
phoebe,What?,4,9
monica,"It’s okay, ‘cause you know what? You don’t really need me for the business.",4,9
phoebe,You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!,4,9
monica,"All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.",4,9
phoebe,For what? I can’t believe this! I got to get out of here.,4,9
monica,"Phoebe, wait a minute!",4,9
rachel,I’m an assistant buyer!!,4,9
joey,"All right, so we’ll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we’ll head back out.",4,9
chandler,"Yeah, all right.",4,9
ross,Okay.,4,9
joey,"So, we’re having fun, right?",4,9
chandler and ross,Yeah.,4,9
joey,"We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.",4,9
ross,I’m kind of beat.,4,9
chandler,"Actually, me too.",4,9
joey,Are you serious?!,4,9
chandler and ross,Yeah.,4,9
joey,Thank God! I’m exhausted!,4,9
gunther,So you guys want coffees?,4,9
joey,"Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have a decaf.",4,9
ross,"Yeah, me too.",4,9
chandler,"Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?",4,9
joey,"I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.",4,9
ross,"I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, you know? I used them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.",4,9
ross,How sad are we?,4,9
joey,"Yeah, I know.",4,9
chandler,"you know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. you know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!",4,9
joey and ross,Yeah!,4,9
joey,Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.,4,9
chandler and ross,Yeah!,4,9
ross,"And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!",4,9
joey,"We’re 29, we’re not women.",4,9
monica,"OH, here you are. you know, I’m-I’m glad you decided to hear me out.",4,9
phoebe,"Okay, I’m hearing.",4,9
monica,"I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.",4,9
phoebe,What?!,4,9
monica,Or! A bakery delivery person.,4,9
phoebe,I wa-I wa-I wa,4,9
monica,Pizza?!,4,9
phoebe,Monica!,4,9
monica,"All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.",4,9
phoebe,No.,4,9
monica,"Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.",4,9
phoebe,No.,4,9
monica,"you know what, let’s do the catering business.",4,9
phoebe,Really?! Are you sure?,4,9
monica,"Yeah, you know I-I made a commitment to you. you know what, it’d be, it’d be fun.",4,9
phoebe,"Oh! It will be fun! OH! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let’s plan the wedding reception.  Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van.  you know what, I want you to take the chef job.",4,9
monica,Really?!,4,9
phoebe,"Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.",4,9
monica,Thank you.,4,9
phoebe,"Besides, it might be kind of fun to form the new A-Team.",4,9
rachel,"Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?",4,9
mrs. lynch,Oh my goodness! You haven’t heard!,4,9
rachel,Heard what?,4,9
mrs. lynch,Joanna passed away last night.,4,9
rachel,Oh my God! How?!,4,9
mrs. lynch,"Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.",4,9
rachel,"Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!",4,9
mrs. lynch,I know!,4,9
rachel,"Oh, God. Oh, God.  Oh God.",4,9
mrs. lynch,I didn’t realize that she was so close.,4,9
rachel,"Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.",4,9
mrs. lynch,"No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.",4,9
rachel,"Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?",4,9
mrs. lynch,"No, I’m sorry. I have to go.",4,9
sophie,Good morning!,4,9
rachel,"Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna",4,9
sophie,I sure did!,4,9
allesandro,"I’m so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emilio, it’s like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we’re going to miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.",4,9
monica,"Umm, I just want to say, uh  that with a pinch of excitement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe...  Are you going to kill me?",4,9
ross,Hey!,4,10
"chandler, joey, and phoebe",Hey!,4,10
ross,"I’m sorry I’m late, did I miss anything?",4,10
phoebe,Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.,4,10
ross,15?  Your personal best!,4,10
phoebe,Where were you?,4,10
ross,"Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.",4,10
chandler,"Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?",4,10
phoebe,"Oh, which museum?",4,10
phoebe,"No, answer his.",4,10
ross,"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.",4,10
chandler,Were you so late because you were burring this woman?,4,10
ross,"No, I’m getting back down because she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.",4,10
chandler,How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.,4,10
joey,"Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now?",4,10
chandler,"Hey, look at this!  They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.",4,10
phoebe,"Umm, that paper’s two weeks old.",4,10
chandler,"All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.",4,10
rachel,"Hey, you know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree again. OH, I want somebody!  you know, I want a man!!  I mean, it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, you know, just like a fling would be great.",4,10
chandler,Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.,4,10
rachel,"Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.",4,10
joey,"Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas.",4,10
chandler,"you know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?",4,10
rachel,"Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?",4,10
chandler,"Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.",4,10
rachel,"Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.",4,10
chandler,Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?,4,10
all,Hey!,4,10
phoebe,What’s wrong Mon?,4,10
monica,"OH, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.",4,10
phoebe,Oh.,4,10
monica,"I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this  on my chef’s hat.",4,10
phoebe,"Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’",4,10
rachel,"Hey, honey! What’s the matter?  Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!",4,10
monica,I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.,4,10
joey,oh!,4,10
monica,"I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life.",4,10
rachel,"Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or, fire them?",4,10
monica,"I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation.",4,10
chandler,"Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.",4,10
joey,"Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?",4,10
monica,"That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?",4,10
joey,Good enough to get fired.,4,10
monica,"All right, you’re hired!",4,10
joey,Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?,4,10
chandler,Yes.,4,10
chandler,"I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now?  Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’m not gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!",4,10
drew,I didn’t think you were gay. I do now.,4,10
chandler,"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",4,10
drew,"Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I’m not looking for any thing serious.",4,10
chandler,"Oh, you know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",4,10
mike,"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?",4,10
chandler,"Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",4,10
mike,Oh wow! I’m free for her!,4,10
drew,"Oh, wait a second! I didn’t say I wasn’t free!",4,10
mike,"Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?",4,10
drew,"Hold on, you know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?",4,10
chandler,"Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!",4,10
mike,"Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.",4,10
chandler,"Well, I don’t really know what that is, but let’s!!",4,10
phoebe,"Hey! You guys, I’m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?",4,10
"monica, rachel, and joey",Yes!,4,10
phoebe,"Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!",4,10
rachel,"Pheebs, that’s great!",4,10
phoebe,"Oh, yay!",4,10
rachel,"But you know umm, Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle.",4,10
phoebe,I know but it’s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!,4,10
joey,What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.,4,10
phoebe,"All good, thanks.  Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that’s easier to rhyme?",4,10
monica,Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?,4,10
rachel,Oh yeah!,4,10
phoebe,"Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?",4,10
chandler,"Hello, children!",4,10
all,Hey!,4,10
chandler,Have I got the 50 guys for you!,4,10
rachel,Really?!,4,10
chandler,"Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They’re buying me drinks! They’re giving me stuff!  Knicks tonight?",4,10
joey,Sure! Where are the seats?,4,10
chandler,Wherever! I’ve got like 20!,4,10
rachel,"So, will I like any of these guys?",4,10
chandler,"you know what, I’m going to uh, play the field just a little more.",4,10
rachel,Chandler!,4,10
chandler,Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?,4,10
phoebe,You work with robots!!,4,10
chandler,"Yes.  Okay, there’s this one guy, Patrick, I think you’re going to like him, he’s really nice, he’s funny, he’s a swimmer.",4,10
rachel,"OH, I like swimmer’s bodies!",4,10
chandler,"Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.",4,10
rachel,"Op, I like credit cards!",4,10
chandler,"See, I’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?",4,10
rachel,"Well, so what does he do?",4,10
chandler,"Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.",4,10
rachel,Your company has a fine foods division?,4,10
chandler,"It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I",4,10
joey,"Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?",4,10
phoebe,"No! No, the robots just work for them.",4,10
monica,"All right, I’m going to go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?",4,10
joey,"Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!",4,10
monica,You want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!,4,10
joey,"Oh, what are you going to do? You’re going to fire me?",4,10
monica,"You bet your ass, I’m going to fire you! Thank you.",4,10
ross,"Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.",4,10
chandler,Oh yeah! With who?,4,10
ross,You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?,4,10
chandler,Yeah.,4,10
ross,"Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. you know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. you know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun.",4,10
phoebe,"If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?",4,10
ross,"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, you know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.",4,10
joey,Hey!,4,10
ross,Hey!,4,10
chandler,"Hey, man!",4,10
phoebe,"Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?",4,10
joey,Damn!,4,10
joey,Hey.,4,10
monica,Hey.,4,10
joey,"Hey, what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket?",4,10
monica,"They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m going to call a meeting tonight, I’m going to fire you tonight.",4,10
joey,You got it! Oh-oh!,4,10
monica,What are you doing?!,4,10
joey,It’s still a tiny bit on fire there.,4,10
monica,Thanks.  I think you got it!,4,10
rachel,Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!,4,10
chandler,"Well, like father, like son.",4,10
rachel,Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.,4,10
chandler,Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.,4,10
rachel,"Well, you know, possibly.  You didn’t tell him that, though? Right?",4,10
chandler,"Umm, no.",4,10
rachel,You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!,4,10
chandler,Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.,4,10
rachel,"Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he’s so going to get the wrong idea.",4,10
monica,"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",4,10
joey,"Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",4,10
a waiter,"Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday.",4,10
joey,There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one!,4,10
the waiter,"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.",4,10
monica,"Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",4,10
the waiter,Because we can remember them.,4,10
monica,Because your all going to make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,4,10
the waiter,"Well, sure, that too.",4,10
monica,"Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm,  tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere",4,10
the waiter,Can’t hear you!,4,10
monica,"A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here.  From now on, it is going to be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!!  Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!",4,10
joey,No ma’am.,4,10
the waiter,"Hey! He has a name, it’s Dragon. Do you want to know your name? Check your hat.  We did the hat right?",4,10
monica,What the hell happened?!,4,10
joey,"I am so-so-so sorry. I was going to do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, ""Wow! It’s been a long time since I had…  327 + 238 dollars!""",4,10
monica,"Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve got to fire you!",4,10
joey,"And I got to pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.",4,10
monica,What kind of things have you been saying?,4,10
joey,"Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.",4,10
phoebe,"Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry",4,10
chandler,"Oh, you know, you know what Pheebs?",4,10
phoebe,What?,4,10
chandler,"I’m not Jewish, so",4,10
phoebe,"So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God!",4,10
chandler,Bad dream?,4,10
ross,I wasn’t sleeping.,4,10
chandler,"Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about?",4,10
ross,"The one with the cat. I got to go, I’ve got another date.",4,10
phoebe,"So, did you pick one yet?",4,10
ross,"No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.",4,10
phoebe,"Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done!",4,10
ross,"you know, you’re right. Thank you.",4,10
phoebe,"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.",4,10
chandler,Prague?,4,10
phoebe,There’s so much you don’t know.,4,10
rachel,"Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?",4,10
chandler,I did! I absolutely did!,4,10
rachel,You idiot!!,4,10
chandler,"I’m sure you’re right, but why?",4,10
rachel,You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!,4,10
chandler,"Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.",4,10
rachel,"you know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!",4,10
chandler,I know! I know!,4,10
rachel,"Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!",4,10
chandler,"Well, you know, you’re-you’re going to meet somebody! You’re a great catch! you know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn’t have to lie once.",4,10
rachel,Really?,4,10
chandler,"Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?",4,10
rachel,No.,4,10
chandler,"Oh, it doesn’t matter.  Hey, you know what, I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game, you want to come with me?",4,10
rachel,Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.,4,10
chandler,"Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth.",4,10
rachel,Well that sounds fun too.,4,10
chandler,Have you ever been with a woman?,4,10
rachel,"What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!",4,10
chandler,So there is no good time to ask that question.,4,10
the conductor,The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!,4,10

kitchen worker,I don’t speak English.,4,10

kitchen worker,"Well, I don’t know what to tell ya!",4,10
monica,Fine!,4,10
monica,"Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I’m cold!  And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!",4,10
the waiter,"You found that handle, did ya?",4,10
monica,That’s not funny.,4,10
the waiter,Well that’s not true.,4,10
monica,"I’m a good person. And I’m a good chef, and I don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! you know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is",4,10
joey,Hey! Chef Geller! you know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!,4,10
monica,You do?,4,10
joey,"You bet I do! I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all.",4,10
monica,Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!,4,10
joey,What are you going to do? You’re going to fire me?,4,10
monica,You bet your ass I’m going to fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!!  All right! Anybody else got a problem? How ‘bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?,4,10
the waiter,No.,4,10
monica,How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it’s funny now?,4,10
the waiter,"No, it’s really good.",4,10
monica,"Good! Now, take those salads to table 4,  And you! Get the swordfish!  And you! Get a haircut!",4,10
the conductor,"Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.",4,10

ross,What?,4,10
woman on train,We’re at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?,4,10
ross,Are we really in Montreal?!,4,10
woman on train,"Yes we are. So, coffee?",4,10
ross,"Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?",4,10
woman on train,"Oh, no. But it’s just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.",4,10
joey,Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!,4,10
monica,Thanks.,4,10
joey,Yep! Looks like it’s going to be a lean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.,4,10
monica,Enough!,4,10
joey,Lean-lean-lean!,4,10
phoebe,"""Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap.                                 Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap.                                 Said all you need is to write them a song.                                 They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along.                                 No, don't sing along.",4,10
phoebe,Oh my God! I can’t believe my little brother is married!,4,11
frank,Oh I know!!,4,11
phoebe,"You guys, why didn’t you tell me you were eloping?",4,11
frank,"because it just sort of happened, you know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch",4,11
phoebe,"Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?",4,11
frank,"We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, ""Hey! you know, we’re here, having lunch let’s get married!",4,11
phoebe,"Wow, a year and a half ago I didn’t even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too.  Okay. Okay. Stop it, don’t. So, I got to get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?",4,11
frank,"Uhh, yeah.",4,11
alice,"We’ve been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we’d get a jump on things, you know no one’s getting any younger.",4,11
frank,"See the thing is umm, we’re not able to you know, uh, conceive.",4,11
alice,"And we’ve tried everything, we’ve seen a bunch of doctors.",4,11
frank,"Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.",4,11
phoebe,That’s a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.,4,11
joey,"Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out!  Guess which job I got.",4,11
chandler,"I don’t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.",4,11
ross,What?,4,11
chandler,Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.,4,11
rachel,But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?,4,11
chandler,"Well, you-you know what I meant.",4,11
monica,"No, you messed it up. You’re stupid.",4,11
chandler,So what job did you get Joe?,4,11
joey,"Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.",4,11
rachel,"Well, how can you be a tour guide, don’t you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?",4,11
joey,"No, not really. They give you all the information, it’s uh, it’s like memorizing a script.  ""And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.",4,11
"chandler, monica, and rachel",Great!! That’s great!,4,11
ross,"Uh actually Joey, it’s the Cretasous period.",4,11
joey,"Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.",4,11
phoebe,Hey!!,4,11
all,Hey!,4,11
phoebe,"Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!",4,11
all,Oh my God!!,4,11
phoebe,"And! And, they’re going to have a baby!  And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.",4,11
ross,My God!,4,11
monica,Are you serious?,4,11
phoebe,Yeah,4,11
joey,You’re really thinking about having sex with your brother?!,4,11
phoebe,"Eww! And ""Oh no!"" It’s—they just want me to be the surrogate. It’s her-it’s her egg and her sperm, and I’m-I’m just the oven, it’s totally their bun.",4,11
joey,Huh.,4,11
monica,What did you tell them?,4,11
phoebe,"Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I’m going to be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.",4,11
chandler,You’re going to be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?,4,11
rachel,"Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.",4,11
monica,"Yeah, like you’re going to be pregnant. I mean pregnant.",4,11
phoebe,I know!,4,11
ross,"Pheebs, you’re talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it’s all for somebody else!",4,11
phoebe,"Yeah, what’s your point?",4,11
ross,"Well, the stuff I just mentioned.",4,11
rachel,Wow! I don’t know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a…keeper.,4,11
phoebe,You know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.,4,11
joey,"No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we’ll be supportive like crazy.",4,11
all,Yeah.,4,11
monica,We just want you to think it through.,4,11
rachel,"Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby. Like your mom?",4,11
phoebe,My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.,4,11
kathy,"Umm,  I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?",4,11
chandler,"Oh, yeah, sure, it’s not mine anyway. It can with the pants.",4,11
kathy,Oh!,4,11
monica,I am so jealous.,4,11
rachel,You guys are really right…there aren’t you?,4,11
chandler,Yes. Right where?,4,11
monica,In the beginning where you know it’s all sex and talking and sex and talking and,4,11
chandler,"Yeah, you-you got to love the talking.",4,11
monica,And the sex?,4,11
chandler,"All right, we haven’t had sex yet. Okay, what’s the big deal? you know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.",4,11
rachel,"Oh, Chandler that is so nice.",4,11
ross,That is really nice…lying! No way is that the reason!,4,11
rachel,Why? Just because you’re not mature enough to understand something like that?!,4,11
chandler,"No, he’s right, I’m totally lying.",4,11
monica,Then what is it?,4,11
chandler,"Well, Kathy’s last boyfriend was Joey.",4,11
ross,And you’re afraid you won’t be able to…fill his shoes.,4,11
chandler,"No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him.",4,11
ross,"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",4,11
chandler,"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",4,11
monica,"So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed.",4,11
chandler,"We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",4,11
monica,"Sweetie, with you it’s going to be different. The sex is going to be great, because you-you guys are in love.",4,11
chandler,Yeah?,4,11
rachel,Yeah!,4,11
ross,Just go for it Chandler.,4,11
monica,"Yeah, you should.",4,11
rachel,"Yeah, you should, really.",4,11
monica,Go on.,4,11
chandler,"All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.",4,11
joey,"Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.",4,11
smart kid,Isn’t the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?,4,11
joey,"Shh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here,  we have a large foot.  Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller.  Everyone wave ‘Hi’ to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work.  Okay, moving right along. Come on.",4,11
p senior,It’s open! Come in!,4,11
phoebe,Hi!,4,11
p senior,Hi!,4,11
phoebe,"I’m sorry, I’m late.",4,11
p senior,"Oh, that’s okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.",4,11
phoebe,Wow! You really go all out when you’re expecting company.,4,11
p senior,"No, I was working on my pottery.",4,11
phoebe,"Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn’t know that you did…pot.",4,11
p senior,"Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.",4,11
phoebe,"Ooh, erotiery!",4,11
p senior,Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. you know,4,11
phoebe,Okay.,4,11
p senior,"I really don’t think it’s a very good idea, Phoebe.",4,11
phoebe,Why not?,4,11
p senior,"Well, because you’d be giving up a baby, and I-I really don’t—I don’t know if there’s anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,",4,11
phoebe,Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don’t-don’t hurt the puppy.,4,11
p senior,"No-no-no, the-the puppy’s yours.",4,11
phoebe,"Oh, I get a puppy!!",4,11
p senior,"Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.",4,11
phoebe,Why?,4,11
p senior,"I realise I don’t have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm,  uhh… Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it’s very important.",4,11
phoebe,Okay.,4,11
p senior,"I mean, I know what I’m talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child.  I really shouldn’t have given you the puppy first.",4,11
phoebe,"All right, I’m sorry.",4,11
joey,"Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I’m-I’m saving this for my friend Ross.",4,11
tour guide,You mean Dr. Geller?,4,11
joey,Doctor? Wow! I didn’t know he had a nickname.,4,11
tour guide,"Oh, he won’t sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.",4,11
joey,"Well, how-how come?",4,11
tour guide,That’s just the way it is.,4,11
joey,That’s crazy.,4,11
tour guide,"Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now… Peter! Hey, Peter! It’s me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin’ which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack!  See, he pretend he don’t even here me!",4,11
joey,"I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you. Anyway, look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he will sit in it!  Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.",4,11
ross,"That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later, Joey.",4,11
tour guide,"Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.",4,11
ross,"Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.",4,11
joey,"It’s no big deal. Hey, you know, you do what you got to do. Right?",4,11
ross,"But hey, it’s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.",4,11
joey,Whatever.,4,11
ross,"It’s like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?",4,11
monica,I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.,4,11
joey,"Look, Ross, really it’s-it’s no big deal. you know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it. you know, hey I understand. you know? Hey, when I’m in a play and you’re in the audience, I don’t talk to you, right? So it’s you know, it’s uh, it’s cool. I’ll see you tomorrow.",4,11

chandler,Hi.,4,11
monica,Hey!,4,11
chandler,Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?,4,11
phoebe,"Ooh, you know what, I think it’s time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let’s go to the balcony.",4,11
monica,What?!,4,11
phoebe,"Umm, the street. Come on, let’s go to the street. Ooh, listen, don’t go onto the balcony until after I get back.",4,11
monica,"So, did you do it?",4,11
chandler,"Yes, yes, we had the sex.",4,11
monica,"Uh-oh, it was bad?",4,11
chandler,"It was fine, you know? But she didn’t agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, ""I see you point, I’m all right with it.""",4,11
monica,"Well, it was the first time. you know, there’s not always a lot of agreement the first time.",4,11
rachel,"Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree  like that.",4,11
chandler,"Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, you know, I know where everything goes, it’s always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, ""My God! Somebody’s killing her in there!""",4,11
monica,"All right, I’m going to show you something a lot of guys don’t know. Rach, give me that pad, please?  All right. Now",4,11
chandler,"Look, you don’t have to draw an actual wo—whoa! She’s hot!",4,11

chandler,There are seven?!,4,11
rachel,"Let me see that.  Oh, yeah.",4,11
chandler,That’s one?,4,11
monica,It’s kind of an important one!,4,11
chandler,"Oh, you know-you know what, I was looking at it upside down.",4,11
rachel,"Well, you know, sometimes that helps.",4,11
monica,"Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.",4,11
chandler,That-that’s bad?,4,11
rachel,"Well if you go to Disneyland, you don’t spend the whole day on the Materhorn.",4,11
chandler,Well you might if it were anything like 7!,4,11
monica,"All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit ‘them all, and you mix ‘them up. You got to keep them on their toes.",4,11
rachel,"Ooh, toes!! Well, for some people.",4,11
monica,"All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,  2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…!",4,11

joey,I will sit with you Dr. Geller.,4,11
ross,"You know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and you know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!"" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.  I’m Ross! I’m divorced, and I have a kid!",4,11
joey,I’m Joey! I’m an actor! I don’t know squat about dinosaurs!,4,11
another tour guide,"I’m Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.",4,11

monica,"you know, I never saw that.",4,11
rachel,"Ooh, it was only okay.",4,11
phoebe,"Ooh, I can’t do this. My mom was right. If I can’t-if I can’t give him up, then there’s no way I can give up a baby. OH, God, Frank and Alice are going to be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give ‘them—a kidney!",4,11
alice,Hi!,4,11
frank,Hi!,4,11

phoebe,Okay.,4,11
frank,"Oh, who’s this little guy?!",4,11

alice,Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don’t know what this means to us! Oh!,4,11
frank,"Oh my God, I think I’m going to cry!",4,11
monica,It’s going to be so great.,4,11

dr. zane,"Um-hmm, five actually.",4,12
phoebe,"Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?",4,12
dr. zane,We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.,4,12
phoebe,That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!,4,12
frank,"Hey, you know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?",4,12
alice,"Sweety, now, she’s a woman, not a gumball machine.",4,12

ross,People can hear you.,4,13
chandler,I know!!,4,13
chandler,Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?,4,13

kathy's co-star,Hi!,4,13
kathy,Hi!,4,13
ross,That is one good looking man!,4,13
chandler,"Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!",4,13
kathy's co-star,"So, you’ve been doing this long?",4,13
kathy,"No, you’re my first. Put the money on the table.",4,13
kathy's co-star,"Oh, yeah! Ooh, that’s nice.",4,13
ross,Dude!,4,13
kathy's co-star,Is that an expensive blouse?,4,13
kathy,If you want it to be.,4,13
ross,Here’s your girlfriend’s button.,4,13
phoebe,"Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?",4,13
monica,"Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?",4,13
phoebe,"Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.",4,13
monica,"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.",4,13
rachel,Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department.,4,13
monica,"Oh my God, are you out of a job?",4,13
rachel,"No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!",4,13
phoebe,Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?,4,13
rachel,Uh-huh.,4,13
phoebe,That sounds great!,4,13
joey,Hey!,4,13
monica,"Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.",4,13
joey,There’s gravy?,4,13
monica,"If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now.",4,13
monica,What are you doing?,4,13
joey,I think I left a donut up here.,4,13
ross,Hey!,4,13
phoebe,Hey!,4,13
joey,Hey!,4,13
phoebe,Ooh! How was Kathy’s play?,4,13
ross,"Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.",4,13
chandler,"Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!",4,13
phoebe,That’s a good idea for a business!,4,13
chandler,"I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are going to be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re going to go to their cast parties and he’s going to try to undermine me. you know it’ll be like, ""So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?"" And she’ll go, ""No-no-no, it’s Chandler."" And he’ll go, ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!""",4,13
joey,That-that is a good trick.,4,13
chandler,"All right, look, look, what am I going to do?",4,13
joey,"Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just because they work together, doesn’t mean they’re going to get together. I mean just because it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s going to happen with them.",4,13
ross,"Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.",4,13
joey,Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.,4,13
ross,Yeah.,4,13
phoebe,"Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.",4,13
ross,They’re not a couple!,4,13
phoebe,"Oh-okay, I get the game now.",4,13
joey,"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",4,13
ross,Oh yeah!,4,13
joey,"Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.",4,13
chandler,Really?,4,13
joey,"Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",4,13
ross,No.,4,13
joey,No!!,4,13
chandler,"So uh, man, are you going to go to the play with me tonight?",4,13
ross,"you know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.",4,13
chandler,"Yeah, I know but",4,13
ross,"Oh no-no-no, I’m there.",4,13
monica,Hey!,4,13
joey,Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?,4,13
monica,You made pancakes?,4,13
joey,Yep! Grab a plate.,4,13
monica,Okay.,4,13
joey,"No-no, stay right there.  Getting’ closer.",4,13
chandler,"Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.",4,13
joey,"Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.",4,13
ross,Oh yeah!,4,13
monica,"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",4,13
joey,"Oh yeah, who’s playing?",4,13
monica,The players.,4,13
ross,Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,4,13
monica,"Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",4,13
joey,"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",4,13
phoebe,Oh.,4,13
rachel,"Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it!  I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now!  Yes I am!  Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message.  Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.",4,13
mr. waltham,"In a moment, please, I’m in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.",4,13
rachel,Hi!,4,13
joshua,"Hi, I’m Joshua.",4,13
rachel,"Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?",4,13
joshua,"Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife",4,13
rachel,"Oh, I’m so sorry.",4,13
joshua,"Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.",4,13
rachel,"Well, at least that’s a great suit.",4,13
joshua,"Yeah, but it wasn’t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.  So I need everything down to underwear, so if you’re willing, I’m all yours.",4,13
rachel,Okay.,4,13
mr. waltham,"Rachel, you needed to speak to me?",4,13
rachel,"No-no, that wasn’t me!  Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear.  The selection of underwear we carry.",4,13
rachel,"Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way.",4,13
joshua,It’s this way? Sorry.,4,13
chandler,"I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!",4,13
ross,"All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.",4,13
chandler,"Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!",4,13
ross,"Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…You know you.",4,13
kathy,Hey you guys!,4,13
ross,Hey!,4,13
kathy,Hi!  Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?,4,13
ross,"Oh, absolutely!",4,13
kathy,Wasn’t Nick funny when he couldn’t get his match lit?,4,13
kathy,"It’s a good play, isn’t it?",4,13
chandler,"Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.",4,13
ross,"Okay, I",4,13
kathy,"Clearly, I’m having sex with him?",4,13
chandler,"Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!",4,13
kathy,"Okay, so let me just get this straight. You’re accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?",4,13
chandler,"you know, I-I could see how this could happen, you know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.",4,13
kathy,"Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I’m-I’m playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!",4,13
chandler,"Well, you can understand, given how we started.",4,13
kathy,"Oh, wow. I can’t believe you’re throwing that in my face.",4,13
chandler,"Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!",4,13
kathy,"I’ll tell you what, Chandler, why don’t you call me when you grow up!",4,13
chandler,"Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!",4,13
rachel,"I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!",4,13
phoebe,Rachel has a new doll.,4,13
rachel,"Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.",4,13
ross,"Uh, hello!",4,13
rachel,Hi-e!!,4,13
phoebe,"Ooh, what do I smell?",4,13
joey,"I don’t know, it smells good.",4,13
monica,Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!,4,13
phoebe,Ooh!,4,13
monica,"Please, have some!",4,13
ross,"Oh, yumm!",4,13
monica,"Yeah, I’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.",4,13
joey,Wow! The new Playboy!,4,13
monica,"Yeah, it’s just something I picked up.",4,13
ross,"Cookies and porn, you’re the best mom ever!!",4,13
phoebe,What? What?,4,13
rachel,"Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.",4,13
ross,"Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?",4,13
rachel,It’s Joshua.,4,13
ross,"Oh, whatever.",4,13
monica,Wait! Wait! This isn’t take-out!,4,13
phoebe,"Well, I hate to eat and run, but",4,13
monica,"No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got porn for you too!",4,13
phoebe,"Yeah, I don’t need it.",4,13
monica,People are supposed to want to hang out here!,4,13
rachel,"Why? Honey, what is the big deal?",4,13
monica,"I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.",4,13
phoebe,"Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of you know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?",4,13
monica,"because they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.",4,13
phoebe,"If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here!",4,13
rachel,"Yeah, that’s true.",4,13
monica,"All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s going to be ten times better than that place!",4,13
phoebe,"Oh, are we going to trash that place?",4,13
chandler,Steps!  Slut!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!,4,13
all,What?!,4,13
ross,So you were right?,4,13
chandler,"I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it!  I don’t live here!",4,13
ross,Chandler!,4,13
rachel,"Chandler, what did she say?",4,13
phoebe,Wait a minute.,4,13
joey,Come here.,4,13
monica,Are you sure?,4,13
chandler,"Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s",4,13
rachel,Beefsteak Charlie’s?,4,13
chandler,Yes! See you and I have always been like—,4,13
rachel,"Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",4,13
monica,"Nah, I got it.",4,13
rachel,"Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.",4,13
rachel,Hi!,4,13
all,Hey!,4,13
rachel,"So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!",4,13
phoebe,Why don’t you ask him out?,4,13
joey,"Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!",4,13
rachel,Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?,4,13
joey,"Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.",4,13
phoebe,He just got a divorce right?,4,13
rachel,Hmm-mmm.,4,13
phoebe,"So he’s probably really nervous around women, you know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.",4,13
rachel,"Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.",4,13
phoebe,You’ve never asked a guy out?!!,4,13
rachel,No. Have you?,4,13
phoebe,Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?,4,13
rachel,I don’t even know how I would go about it.,4,13
joey,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, ""Hey, how you doin’?""",4,13
phoebe,"Oh, please!",4,13
joey,"Hey, how you doin’?",4,13
rachel,"You know what, I’m going to do that, I’m going to call him up, and I’m going to ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out.  How you doin’?  Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s.  Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we— the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye.   You’ve done that a thousand times?",4,13
phoebe,I’ve never done that.,4,13
rachel,"OH, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.",4,13
joey,"Well, you got to give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!",4,13
rachel,Really?! You think that will work?,4,13
joey,"Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?",4,13
joey,What the heck is that?,4,13
chandler,Did she call?,4,13
phoebe,"No, sorry.",4,13
chandler,"All right, maybe I should call her.",4,13
joey,"No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!",4,13
ross,"He’s right, what she did was unforgivable.",4,13
chandler,"Well, yeah, but you know, what-what if I was wrong?",4,13
ross,How might you be wrong?,4,13
chandler,"Well you know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?",4,13
joey,"Dude, tell me she actually told you this.",4,13
chandler,"She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!",4,13
ross,That’s all you’re basing this on?,4,13
chandler,"That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.",4,13
joey,"Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.",4,13
chandler,Oh my God!!,4,13
rachel,"Would you like to go to a basketball game with me?  You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too…  Umm, who likes the Knicks—",4,13
joshua,What do you think?,4,13
rachel,"Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!",4,13
joshua,Huh.  Yeah?,4,13
rachel,"Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great.  Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great.  Umm, so you like it?",4,13

rachel,Great.,4,13
joshua,"All right, thank you so much for all your help.",4,13
rachel,Sure.,4,13
joshua,"Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.",4,13
rachel,Yeah-eah-ha!,4,13
joshua,"Thanks.  Maybe I’ll see in the spring, with the uh, you know, for the uh, bathing suits.",4,13
rachel,"Oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!",4,13
joshua,"Ah, that’s okay, thanks.",4,13
rachel,Okay.,4,13
joshua,"Anyway, hopefully, I’ll see you around sometime.",4,13
rachel,Basketball!,4,13
joshua,I’m sorry.,4,13
rachel,"I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week.",4,13
joshua,Wow! That would be great.,4,13
rachel,Really?,4,13
joshua,"Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.",4,13
mr. waltham,Good morning.,4,13
joshua,Hi!,4,13
kathy,Hey.,4,13
chandler,"Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. you know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.",4,13
kathy,Oh wow. I really wish you’d call me.,4,13
chandler,"Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but you know I-I think this is a good thing. You know? because we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. you know, I know for me— Nick’s pants?",4,13
kathy,Yeah.,4,13
chandler,"Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!",4,13
joey,"Okay, for next time, what do you say?",4,13
rachel,"I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.",4,13
ross,"So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?",4,13
rachel,"He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date, I’m just not on it!",4,13
monica,"Okay, it’s ready. Come on.",4,13
joey,What’s ready?,4,13

phoebe,Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?,4,13
monica,"Pretty much.  So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?",4,13
joey,"I don’t know, it looks the same.",4,13
monica,You used to have carpet.,4,13

chandler,"Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.",4,13
phoebe,Oh good!,4,13
chandler,She is now.,4,13
ross,What are you saying?,4,13
chandler,"I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! you know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.",4,13
phoebe,How? How is your fault?,4,13
chandler,"Because, I-I should’ve called! you know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!",4,13
rachel,"Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.",4,13
ross,"Well, if-if she thought they were on a break",4,13
mr. waltham,"Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.",4,13
rachel,Really?,4,13

joey,"That’s all right. Hey you guys, you know what’s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, ""Joey, what are you doing with your life?"" stuff. I can say, ""Well, I’m doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?""",4,14
all,Great!,4,14
chandler,"You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here. Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you.  Well, except you.",4,14
monica,"Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?",4,14
joey,"Look, there’s nothing I can do for him right now, he’s still in his sweat pants, that’s still Phase One. You know? I’ll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.",4,14
monica,What’s Phase Two?,4,14
joey,Getting’ drunk and going to a strip club.,4,14
rachel,How does going to a strip club help him better?,4,14
ross,Because there are naked ladies there.,4,14
joey,"Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.",4,14
ross,There are naked ladies there too.,4,14
joey,Yeah.,4,14
chandler,Would you give me one minute!! Please.,4,14

rachel,No! Nothing!,4,14
joshua,"I invested in this night-club and it’s opening tonight, would you like to come?",4,14
rachel,Yeah! That would be great!,4,14
joshua,You’re into hardcore S&M right?,4,14
rachel,"Well, I-I guess—I",4,14
joshua,"Kidding!  I’m going to get there early, but I’m going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.",4,14
rachel,"Yeah, great, you bet!",4,14

rachel,"Oh well, no I",4,14
emily,"Oh, no-no-no, that’s not rude! It’s perfectly in keeping with a trip that I’ve already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who’s got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.",4,14
monica,I-I-I think you look great.,4,14
emily,"Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.",4,14
rachel,I’ll get her.,4,14

rachel,"Hey—whoa, slow down.  No, keep moving.  Wow!",4,14
monica,So? How did it go with Joshua last night?,4,14
rachel,"Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.",4,14
monica,What?,4,14
phoebe,Why?,4,14
rachel,"The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.",4,14
phoebe,"OH! So, did you get to meet her?",4,14
rachel,"No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, ""I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!"" and he let her right in.",4,14
monica,So you hit her in the face?,4,14
rachel,"No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. oh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.",4,14
phoebe,"Aww, Pheebs.",4,14
rachel,"Honey, that’s you’re name.",4,14
phoebe,That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!,4,14

chandler,Ow!,4,14
rachel,How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!,4,14
chandler,"Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time.",4,14
ross,"When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.",4,14
emily,Ross! Come quickly! There’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!,4,14
ross,"I’ve got to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!",4,14

rachel,I don’t get this! She was horrible!,4,14
chandler,"Okay, I’m going to go stand over there.",4,14
monica,Why do you care so much anyway?,4,14
rachel,"I don’t care! All right, you know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—you know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!",4,14
monica,"Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.",4,14
rachel,"Oh, you know, would you just for once, not remember every…little…thing!!",4,14
chandler,"So you know, uh, when’s he getting back?",4,14
monica,A couple of days.,4,14
chandler,"you know, I knew something like this was going to happen.",4,14
monica,What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!,4,14
chandler,"Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go back in time.",4,14
phoebe,"Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.",4,14
monica,"Yeah, come on, we can be guys!",4,14
chandler,No you can’t.,4,14
phoebe,Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!,4,14
chandler,"You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy and wouldn’t live as long.",4,14
phoebe,"you know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!",4,14
chandler,Okay.,4,14

joey,"No-no, it’s uh, it’s Heston.",4,14
the a.d,What?,4,14
joey,"Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.",4,14
the a.d,"There’s no way he smells, he’s the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.",4,14
joey,"Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?",4,14
the a.d,"The one with ""Heston"" on it.",4,14

phoebe,"Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha!",4,14
monica,"Very good,  so good.",4,14
phoebe,"I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.",4,14
rachel,"Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!",4,14

phoebe,"Well, if you think it will help.",4,14
chandler,"No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m going to get really drunk and want to call Kathy and you guys are going to have to stop me! And then after that, I’m going to get so drunk, I’m going to want to call Janice",4,14
phoebe,You should! How is she?,4,14

charlton heston,Listen to me!,4,14
joey,"Oh yeah, yeah.",4,14
charlton heston,"I don’t know one actor worth his salt that didn’t say at one time or another, ""God, I stink!"" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up.

chandler,Yeah?,4,14
phoebe,And do you know what girls are really good at?,4,14

chandler,"You know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And you said it was going to be fun!  Which it kind of is.  Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!",4,15
rachel,"Chandler, there’s a guy right over there.",4,15
chandler,That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman!   Hi. How are you?,4,15
rachel,"Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!  That does!  What am I sitting on?  I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.",4,15
chandler,"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",4,15

phoebe,What?! I thought you were crazy about her!,4,15
chandler,"Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality—Well, they’re all back! you know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!",4,15
joey,So what are you doing bringing her here?! There’s people here!,4,15
chandler,Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight.,4,15
rachel,You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.,4,15
chandler,"Well, I don’t have to break up with her this time. We’re not involved! I’m going to do a pre-emptive strike! I’m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!",4,15
joey,"Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes.  I’m telling’ you!",4,15
emily,"I can’t believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.",4,15

liam,"Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.",4,15
emily,"Oh, Liam.",4,15

liam,Cheers!,4,15
ross,Cheers!,4,15
janice,"Oh boy, I just love to sing!",4,15
chandler,"Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.",4,15
janice,"Oh, look at us! Who would’ve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.",4,15
chandler,"Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship",4,15
janice,"I know! And I’m just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!",4,15
chandler,Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.,4,15

chandler,"No! No! Not, Paris.",4,15
janice,"Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?",4,15

chandler,I don’t know exactly.,4,15
janice,"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",4,15
chandler,But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.,4,15
monica,Done?,4,15
phoebe,Yep!,4,15
rachel,Hey!,4,15
joey,Hey! What’s up?,4,15
monica,"This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.",4,15
joey,I bet I stopped listening before you did.,4,15
rachel,"you know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.",4,15
monica,"Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go.  I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?",4,15
rachel,It’s coming from Joey!,4,15
phoebe,"Oh my God, that’s so freaky! Turn him off!!",4,15
phoebe,"Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.",4,15
ross,"Oh, just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport.",4,15
joey,"Dude, you’re not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.",4,15
janice,Hey there Ross!,4,15
ross,Hey!,4,15
phoebe,Janice.,4,15
chandler,"you know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack.",4,15
janice,"OH, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn’t really leave me much choice. Did you?",4,15
chandler,"Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!",4,15
joey,"Hey-hey, what’s going on?",4,15
chandler,"Oh, I’m packing. you know I’m-I’m packing because I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.",4,15
joey,Thanks for telling me!,4,15
chandler,"I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the only way I can get rid off her.",4,15
joey,"oh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.",4,15
janice,"Chandler! Come on, I’m going to show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It’s a real space saver.",4,15
phoebe,"Yeah, I know, I do that because it makes me look taller.",4,15
janice,"Okay, Chandler, come on!",4,15
chandler,"Okay.  Joey, trade lives with me!",4,15
joey,"Nope.  Man look at this! Ross, I can’t believe you said you’d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!",4,15
ross,"Hey, I can handle it! All right?",4,15
rachel,"Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.",4,15
ross,That’s ‘because you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.,4,15
joey,"Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That’s called a scrum, okay? It’s kind of like a huddle.",4,15
ross,"And is a hum, kind of like a scruddle?",4,15
joey,Ross!  They’re going to kill you!,4,15
phoebe,"Well, why are you doing this anyway?",4,15
ross,"Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby.",4,15
phoebe,You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.  OH! I see how you did that. All right.,4,15
ross,"Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m going to show her how tough I really am!",4,15
rachel,"I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right, you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know.",4,15
joey,"All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like he’s…Chandler!",4,15
chandler,Thanks!,4,15
ross,"Look, don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I’ll uh, I’ll be that guy right out of the circle.",4,15
all,Oh!,4,15
rachel,"Oh, well maybe there was a dog looking’ at him.",4,15
joey,"Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one—Dude! They’re all huge!",4,15
ross,They don’t look any bigger than me!,4,15
joey,"Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",4,15
emily,I’m just going to say hi to the lads. All right?,4,15
ross,All right.,4,15
emily,Okay.,4,15
phoebe,Hi.,4,15
phoebe,Whoa!  I kind of liked it.,4,15
ross,"Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross.  you know, Red Ross!",4,15
joey,I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.,4,15
ross,Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!,4,15
joey,No.,4,15
ross,You’ll see.,4,15
emily,"Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it’s his first time.",4,15
liam,You don’t say!,4,15
emily,"Good luck, babe.",4,15
liam,Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here!  Ross! Come on!,4,15
liam,"Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!",4,15
ross,JOEY!!!!!!,4,15
rachel,"You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?",4,15
monica,He asked you out?!,4,15
rachel,No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.,4,15
monica,Saucy!,4,15
rachel,What are these?,4,15
monica,Electrical plans for the building.,4,15
rachel,"Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?",4,15
monica,"I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.",4,15
rachel,Wow! If only more people knew.,4,15
chandler,"you know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",4,15
janice,"Oh please. Every moment is precious. you know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.",4,15
chandler,"Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",4,15
janice,"On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane.",4,15
chandler,"Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.",4,15
ticket counter attendant,One ticket to Yemen?,4,15
chandler,"Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.",4,15
ticket counter attendant,"I’m sorry sir, I don’t understand.",4,15
chandler,What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?,4,15
ticket counter attendant,Are you travelling with a child?,4,15
chandler,"No. All right, you know what, she’s  going to think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really going to do is hand you a library card.",4,15
ticket counter attendant,"Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don’t take library cards.",4,15
janice,What’s the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?,4,15
chandler,American Express?,4,15
emily,I can’t believe they’re doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!,4,15
phoebe,"No offence but, you know sometimes it’s hard to understand you, you know with the accent, so",4,15
emily,"That’s just halftime, there’s more of this.",4,15
ross,"Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!",4,15
emily,Right.,4,15
ross,"Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?",4,15
emily,Okay.,4,15
ross,Thanks.  I-I think I’m dying. I really do.,4,15
phoebe,"Oh, poor baby.",4,15

phoebe,She’s right! You have to stop!,4,15
ross,"What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!",4,15
joey,"Dude, if you go back out there, you’re going to be Dead Ross!",4,15
ross,I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!,4,15
emily,"All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.",4,15
ross,"No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.",4,15
emily,No. That’s not what I’m saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.,4,15
ross,I like that.,4,15
emily,"Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.",4,15
ross,Huh?,4,15
emily,One swift kick and he’ll back off.,4,15
ross,"All right, bad ankle, got it!",4,15
emily,"And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn’t wear a cup.",4,15
ross,"Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!",4,15
emily,"And uh, Liam, Liam’s got bad knees. You hit him right and he’ll go down like a lamp.",4,15

rachel,Hey!,4,15
monica,Hi!,4,15

monica,"No-no-no, no!",4,15
monica,"I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture.",4,15
rachel,Oh my God! Look at this!,4,15
monica,"Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!",4,15
rachel,I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!,4,15
monica,I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.,4,15
rachel,And did you?!,4,15
monica,"No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.",4,15
monica,But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.,4,15
rachel,Oh my God.,4,15
mrs. chatracus,Hello darling.,4,15
rachel,"Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.",4,15
phoebe,"Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?",4,15
ross,"Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! you know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket.",4,15
joey,"Yeah, sure.",4,15
ross,"No, not you.",4,15
joey,"Uhh, look, your eye’s still popping out a little, I’m going to go get some ice.",4,15
phoebe,"Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!",4,15
emily,You were amazing out there.,4,15
ross,"Oh, I kind of was, wasn’t I?",4,15
emily,Oh my God!,4,15
ross,"I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks.",4,15
emily,You really enjoyed yourself didn’t you?,4,15
ross,"Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am. And it’s all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.",4,15
emily,I think you’ve got concussion.,4,15
ross,"No, no, I’m serious. Thank you.",4,15
emily,You’re welcome.  I’m sorry. Did I hurt you?,4,15
ross,"It’s worth the pain.  you know what, you know what? It’s not.",4,15
ticket counter attendant,This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.,4,15
chandler,"Well, I-I guess I got to go.",4,15
janice,"Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I’ll wait for you. Do you even know how long you’re going to be gone?",4,15
chandler,"Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.",4,15
janice,"Oh. Well, I’ll right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen.",4,15

janice,No! No! I want to see you take-off.,4,15
chandler,"Well, I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?",4,15
monica,All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.,4,15
rachel,Thank God.,4,15
monica,"I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.",4,15
phoebe,See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it.,4,15
monica,What is it hon?,4,16
phoebe,"I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake!  No.",4,16
monica,"Aww, honey I’m sorry.",4,16

chandler,Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.,4,16
joey,Yeah?,4,16
phoebe,"It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?",4,16
joey,Is it the shampoo? It’s guava.,4,16
phoebe,No!,4,16
joey,Oh! Wait-wait!  Is it my bologna sandwich?,4,16
phoebe,Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!,4,16
joey,"Oh, wait-wait!  Maybe it’s a pickle?!",4,16
chandler,What are you writing?,4,16
rachel,"Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.",4,16
chandler,"Oh yeah?  Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you  never go out of style—what did you throw away?",4,16
chandler,Hi guys!,4,16

emily,"My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.",4,16
ross,Yeah.,4,16
emily,"They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!",4,16
monica,"I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff.",4,16
emily,"I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there.  It’s a joke.",4,16
ross,Bye.,4,16
emily,"Right, I’ve got to be off, I’ll see you. Buh-bye then.",4,16
joey,Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.,4,16
ross,"Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! you know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes.  She’s leaving in two days, I don’t have to do it.",4,16
monica,"Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.",4,16
ross,"Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it. you know.",4,16
joey,Hey that’s what all my relationships are like.,4,16
chandler,"Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.",4,16
ross,Pheebs!,4,16
all,Hey!,4,16
ross,Hello! Hello!,4,16
phoebe,"Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, you know? And I got nauseous.",4,16
chandler,Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!,4,16
phoebe,Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.,4,16
joey,"Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.",4,16
phoebe,"That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too.",4,16
joshua,Okay!,4,16
rachel,"Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.",4,16
joshua,"Oh great!  Wow! Yeah, it’s comfortable.",4,16
rachel,Yeah?,4,16
joshua,"Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.",4,16
rachel,"Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.",4,16
joshua,Why not?!,4,16
rachel,"Well, that’s because of a lot of",4,16
joshua,"you know, they ruin it for everybody.",4,16
rachel,I know!,4,16
joshua,"you know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.",4,16
rachel,Oh?,4,16
joshua,"Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.",4,16
rachel,"Well, congratulations, so do you love her?",4,16
joshua,"No, no, no, she’s nice but, you know, it just it made me realize that I’m just not, I’m just not ready to be dating, you know?",4,16
rachel,"Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting.",4,16
joshua,"Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?",4,16
rachel,"Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device.",4,16
joshua,"Then uh, what’s-what’s this?",4,16
rachel,"You need that, you need that too because obviously, a thief could just tear this up.",4,16
rachel,"Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.",4,16
chandler,What are you talking about?,4,16
joey,"Yeah, what’ going on?",4,16
rachel,"We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua.  Look, he said he’s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!",4,16
ross,"Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.",4,16
joey,Aww!,4,16
emily,Hello?,4,16
rachel,Surprise!!!,4,16
chandler and joey,Surprise!!,4,16
emily,No one’s ever thrown me a surprise party before!,4,16
rachel,"Well, it was all Ross’s idea.",4,16
emily,You’re so sweet! And I’m so surprised!,4,16
ross,You really didn’t know?,4,16
chandler,Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?,4,16
rachel,"Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s looking over here, say something funny.",4,16
chandler,Like what?,4,16
joey,What-what-what is so funny?,4,16
chandler,"I said, ""Like what?""",4,16
joey,Now that’s a thinker.,4,16
rachel,"Okay, you know what, you know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries.  Okay. Okay.  Hi!",4,16
joshua,Hi!,4,16
rachel,Care for a cherry?,4,16
joshua,"Oh, no thanks.",4,16
rachel,"No? you know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.",4,16
joshua,You okay?  You all right?,4,16
ross,So we should probably get going soon.,4,16
emily,"Oh, but the party’s only just getting started!",4,16
ross,"Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then you know, then The Plaza for dinner.",4,16
emily,So why did you plan a party at the same time?,4,16
ross,"No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually, ""Surprise!"" And then, ""Oh my God, I’m so surprised—good-bye!""",4,16
emily,"But Ross, I’m such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.",4,16
ross,Monica said that did she?,4,16
phoebe,"Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?",4,16

joey,"Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl",4,16
chandler,She was a welder.,4,16
joey,"What? Were you like in the movie, or… Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.",4,16
monica,"Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.",4,16
rachel,It’s not Christmas!,4,16
monica,Or Spin the Bottle?,4,16
rachel,He’s not 11!,4,16
emily,Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.,4,16
rachel,What? You’re leaving?!,4,16

ross,"Okay, that-that’s enough! you know, let’s, let’s let someone else play.",4,16
joey,"If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?",4,16
rachel,"Okay, my turn!!",4,16
phoebe,Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!,4,16
all,OH!,4,16
rachel,"It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!",4,16
all,Oh my God!,4,16
rachel,"All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.",4,16
rachel,Just a bug.,4,16
phoebe,"you know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. you know why I’m never going to eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.",4,16
chandler,Okay.,4,16
chandler,There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich!,4,16
joey,"Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!",4,16
phoebe,I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.,4,16
joey,"All right look, you know how-you know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really hot?",4,16
phoebe,"Yeah, totally!",4,16
joey,"All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going to do something wrong,  do it right!",4,16
joey,Feel better now?,4,16
phoebe,"Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m going to eat like, you know millions of cows.",4,16
joey,"Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for you, meat wise.",4,16
phoebe,What?,4,16
joey,"Well, I eat a lot of meat right?",4,16
phoebe,Yeah.,4,16
joey,"Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.",4,16
phoebe,"Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.",4,16
joey,"Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?",4,16
ross,"Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.",4,16
emily,"But, we can’t go now. It looks like Rachel’s going to put on a skit.",4,16
monica,Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?,4,16
rachel,"No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.",4,16
monica,"Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can’t let—, actually I kind of want to see what happens.",4,16

rachel,"Oh, yeah! Real fun.  you know, this bra… Really, bothers me.  you know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, you know what they’d say? want to hear some memories?",4,16
joshua,"Need uh, need a little hand there.",4,16
rachel,"Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.",4,16
joshua,You really don’t seem like you do. That’s,4,16
rachel,"Ugh!! Forget it!  This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.",4,16
joshua,"Well, what was supposed to happen?",4,16
rachel,"Can you not look at me when I say this?  I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.",4,16
joshua,"Huh. Oh, boy!  Uhh, I-I don’t wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.",4,16
rachel,"Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!",4,16
joshua,"No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.",4,16
rachel,Why?!,4,16
joshua,Because I-I like you.,4,16
rachel,You like me?,4,16
joshua,Yeah! I mean you’re-you’re beautiful and smart and sophisticated—a lot of this isn’t based on tonight.,4,16
rachel,"Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!",4,16

rachel,Okay.,4,16
rachel,"OH, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.",4,16
ross,"That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so",4,16
rachel,"Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.",4,16
ross,Yeah.,4,16
rachel,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.",4,16
ross,Helps a little.,4,16
rachel,Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?,4,16
ross,"Yeah, have a seat.",4,16
rachel,I’m so sorry.,4,16
ross,"That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn’t want it to end this way, you know?",4,16
rachel,"Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?",4,16
ross,What do you mean?,4,16
rachel,You seem to really like her.,4,16
ross,"Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I going to do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was going to be a two-week thing, you know no commitment.",4,16
rachel,"Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.",4,16
ross,You think?,4,16
rachel,"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.",4,16
ross,"Hey, you’re right.",4,16
rachel,Yeah.,4,16
ross,Thanks.  What photo album was it?,4,16

phoebe,Okay.,4,16
joey,Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?,4,16
phoebe,Six months.,4,16

joey,What is that?,4,17
chandler,Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.,4,17
mr. treeger,What in the name of hell?,4,17
joey,Maybe he found you flip-flop.,4,17
chandler,Hey!,4,17
joey,Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must’ve hit something on the remote.,4,17
chandler,Do we pay for this?,4,17
joey,"No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us.",4,17
chandler,Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone sex.,4,17
joey,Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill?,4,17
mr. treeger,"Whoa, hey, that lady’s all kinds of naked.",4,17
chandler,"Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!",4,17
mr. treeger,"Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.",4,17
chandler,Like finding money with naked people on it!,4,17
mr. treeger,"Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I’m sad.",4,17
joey,Why would he turn off the TV?,4,17
rachel,"All right, you know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?",4,17
joey and chandler,Oh no-no-no-no!,4,17
chandler,We don’t know what could make this go away.,4,17
joey,"Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!",4,17
chandler,And no one touches the air around the TV!,4,17
joey,"Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?",4,17
monica,"Well at least, I’m going to mute it.",4,17
joey and chandler,Oh no-no-no!,4,17
chandler,We still have porn.,4,17
joey,Hey.,4,17
phoebe,Hi!,4,17

phoebe,Yeah.,4,17
rachel,"Give it here.  Oh, God.",4,17
monica,Okay.,4,17
phoebe,"OH, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. you know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.",4,17
chandler,Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.,4,17
phoebe,You mean like a doctor?,4,17
joey,Pheebs! You’re blocking the porn! Look out!,4,17
phoebe,"OH!  Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.",4,17
ross,Hi.,4,17
monica,Hi.,4,17
ross,"So uh, Emily just went to the airport.",4,17
monica,Oh. Why didn’t you take her?,4,17
ross,"Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And you know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so",4,17
monica,You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!,4,17
ross,Nah.,4,17
monica,"Hey, cheer up! You’re going to see her again, right?",4,17
ross,"Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said,  ""This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…""",4,17
monica,"No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent. You’ve got to see her again.",4,17
ross,And why do you care so much?,4,17
monica,Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!,4,17
ross,You had fantasies about Emily?,4,17
monica,"No! you know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.",4,17
ross,Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?,4,17
monica,"Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!",4,17
ross,Ahh.,4,17
monica,Do you love her?,4,17
ross,"We said it was only going to be two weeks, you know?",4,17
monica,You love her!,4,17
ross,What-what is love really?,4,17
monica,"oh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just going to catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re going to call out her name and say, ""I love you!"" And she’s going to say, ""I love you, too!"" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.",4,17
ross,I am a good kisser.,4,17
monica,"Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in…  I’ve been watching too much porn.",4,17
rachel,Is that the heartbeat?,4,17
the doctor,That’s it.,4,17
phoebe,Oh my God!,4,17
rachel,Oh wow! This is so cool.,4,17
the doctor,Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?,4,17
phoebe,"Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I’ll hold onto your card, okay?",4,17
the doctor,"No, I’m getting three separate heartbeats.",4,17
phoebe,Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one!,4,17
the doctor,Doctors are wrong all the time.,4,17
phoebe,"Well, yeah.",4,17
rachel,"Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!",4,17
the doctor,Definitely.,4,17
phoebe,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I’m going to have three full grown babies just walking’ around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it’s going to be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!,4,17
the doctor,"Actually, giving birth to three babies isn’t that different from giving birth to one.",4,17
phoebe,What do you know?!,4,17
alice,"Oh-oh, Phoebe!",4,17
phoebe,Ooh! Hi!,4,17
alice,"Hi!  So, how did it go at the doctors?",4,17

frank,Yes.,4,17
phoebe,"Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies.",4,17
alice,Three babies?,4,17
frank,I finally got my band!,4,17
alice,"We’re going to have a big family, I’ve always wanted a big family!",4,17
phoebe,"Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.",4,17
frank,Why would we be freaked?,4,17
phoebe,"No, no maybe because it’s harder to raise them, and the added expense, and",4,17
frank,Oh.,4,17
alice,Right.,4,17
phoebe,"No, back to happy. Back to happy!",4,17
alice,"No-no-no, no, it’s going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. you know it’ll-it’ll be like my very own little sweatshop.",4,17
frank,"Yeah, I’ve been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.",4,17
alice,"No, Frank.",4,17
phoebe,No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?,4,17
frank,"Yeah, refrigerator college.",4,17
alice,Yeah.,4,17
frank,"Yeah, you know when we found out we were going to have a baby, you know I figured you know like I should you know have like a career—and I love refrigerators!",4,17
phoebe,You can’t give up on your dream.,4,17
frank,"No, it’s okay. We’re-we’re going to have three kids! And that’s-that’s a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.",4,17
ticket agent,This is the boarding call for Flight 009.,4,17

emily,Oh.  Thank you.,4,17
ross,That’s no problem.,4,17

chandler,It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.,4,17
rachel,you know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.,4,17
joey,Yeah right.,4,17
rachel,"No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.",4,17
chandler,"Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?",4,17
rachel,Yes!,4,17
joey,"Yeah, he likes porn.",4,17
monica,Where you going?,4,17
rachel,"I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny.  Hey, Pheebs!",4,17
phoebe,Hey.,4,17
joey,Hey!,4,17
monica,How did it go with Frank and Alice?,4,17
phoebe,"Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you  about, because you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.",4,17
chandler,They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.,4,17
monica,OH! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?,4,17
ross,I did.,4,17
monica,"And well, what did she say?",4,17
ross,Thank you.,4,17
monica,"Oh, you’re totally welcome! What’d she say?",4,17
ross,"She said, ""Thank you."" I said, ""I love you."" And she said, ""Thank you.""",4,17
chandler,"Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?",4,17
joey,"Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!",4,17
ross,What do I do now?,4,17
joey,You play hard to get.,4,17
ross,She already lives in London.,4,17
joey,Then you go to Tokyo.,4,17
chandler,"All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it’s over.",4,17
monica,It is not over! You’re over!,4,17
chandler,What?,4,17
monica,You know!,4,17
chandler,Okay.  Good one.,4,17
monica,"It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!",4,17
ross,"Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, you know just to she what’s going on, and, and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over.",4,17
joey,"Way to be strong, man!",4,17
rachel,Hey!,4,17
chandler,"Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.",4,17
rachel,"Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?",4,17
chandler,Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.,4,17
phoebe,"Ooh, good, you’re hear! Okay.",4,17
monica,Hey!,4,17
phoebe,Hi!,4,17
rachel,"Well, what-what ‘cha got there?",4,17
phoebe,"Oh this, well I’m glad you asked.  Now, don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?  Ahh! Now, I know what you’re thinking",4,17
chandler,Pregnant Woman Slays Four?,4,17
monica,"Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they?",4,17
phoebe,No!,4,17
monica,Are you sure?,4,17
phoebe,No!,4,17
rachel,"Honey, you’re not going to make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.",4,17
phoebe,"No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.",4,17
chandler,What’s the second part of your plan?,4,17
phoebe,My Saturn dealership.,4,17
ross,Hello?,4,17
emily,Ross.,4,17
ross,"Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?",4,17
emily,It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.,4,17
ross,"No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you called.",4,17
emily,"Ross umm, there’s something that I’ve got to tell you, there’s-there’s someone else.",4,17
ross,Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?,4,17
ross,"She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.",4,17
monica,"This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be another guy.",4,17
ross,Well,4,17
monica,Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!,4,17
ross,"I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!",4,17
chandler,You put your fist through the wall?,4,17
ross,"No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!",4,17
monica,You have to go to London!,4,17
ross,What?,4,17
monica,"Yeah, you have to go fight for her!",4,17
joey,"Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. because you already told her you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her!",4,17
monica,"When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?",4,17
ross,I made fun of his accent.,4,17
monica,"You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?",4,17
ross,No.,4,17
monica,"All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily!  That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!",4,17
ross,Really?,4,17
monica,Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go without a fight!,4,17
ross,"All right. All right, I’m going to do it!",4,17
monica,All right.,4,17
ross,"I’m going to, I’m going to go to London and I’m going to fight for her.",4,17
monica,"Okay, good luck!",4,17
joey,"Ross! Ross! If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?",4,17
rachel,Hey!,4,17
phoebe,Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m going to open up my own massage place and Frank’s going to help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!,4,17
monica,"That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?",4,17
rachel,"Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised",4,17
phoebe,I’m telling it! I’m telling it!,4,17
rachel,Okay.,4,17
phoebe,"Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I’ve got?",4,17
chandler,A place where no one will ever get out alive?,4,17
phoebe,"No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it’s",4,17
rachel,Relaxi-Taxi!,4,17
phoebe,The name was my favourite part!,4,17
rachel,"Well, well I can up with it!",4,17
phoebe,YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good.,4,17
rachel,"Well, I",4,17
monica,Hello.,4,17
ross,Hey.,4,17
monica,"Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?",4,17
ross,"No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!",4,17
monica,"All right. When is, when is the next flight out?",4,17
ross,About four hours.,4,17
monica,"Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show up by then, then just come on home.",4,17
phoebe,"Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that’s better than Relaxi Cab.",4,17
rachel,"Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab, like taxicab.",4,17
phoebe,"Oh, that is better.",4,17
chandler,Are we in London?,4,17
monica,What are you doing here? You can’t be here!,4,17
emily,"I’ve uh, I’ve come to talk to Ross.",4,17
emily,What?,4,17
joey,"Nothing. No, nothing.",4,17
emily,"I was going to call him, but",4,17
monica,"Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it!  I was right!  I’m right, right?",4,17
emily,I’d really rather talk to him.,4,17
monica,Oh.,4,17
emily,"I uh, I’ve been to his apartment and he wasn’t there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?",4,17
emily,"Ross, are you there? Ross, I don’t know if you can hear this but…  I’m going to talk anyway, uh, I’m in the States with you sister and your friends and it’s all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you—Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.",4,17
ross,"I love you too! I’m, I’m going to call you right now from the phone booth!  You can’t hear me.",4,17
emily,"I wish I could know if you’d heard any of that. I suppose I’ve either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you’re listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there’s not much chance you did heard that, and there’s the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well.  Hello.",4,17
ross,Hi.,4,17
emily,"Ross, I love you!",4,17
ross,OH! Thank you.,4,17
chandler,Hey.,4,17
joey,Hey.,4,17
chandler,"I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.",4,17
joey,"Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!",4,17
chandler,"What, no, ""Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?""",4,17
joey,No! Nothing!,4,17

chandler,"Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.",4,18
phoebe,"Ha-ha.  No, it’s just I’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought ‘til I’m not, I’m just going to play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!",4,18
chandler,All right.,4,18
phoebe,"Listen. Listen.  Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?",4,18

phoebe,"Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.",4,18
alice,"No. No. No.  Okay, now, see, I want to name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.",4,18
chandler,Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?,4,18
alice,"Don’t get me started.  Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.",4,18
phoebe,Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.,4,18
alice,You think about it.,4,18
emily,"I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don’t think your son will think it’s yours and be horribly traumatised?",4,18
ross,"Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.",4,18
emily,"OH, it’s time to go.",4,18
ross,"Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?",4,18
emily,Well that’s ambitious.,4,18
ross,"Hey, uh, you can ignore that.",4,18
emily,That’s Carol with your son!,4,18
ross,"Uhh, believe me when he’s older, he’ll understand.",4,18

carol,"OH, you know, Susan’s going to be shooting a commercial in London next week.",4,18
susan,"Oh yeah, I’m so excited, I’ve never been there.",4,18
emily,"Oh, well, I’ll show you around.",4,18
susan,"That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions",4,18
emily,"Oh, there’s tonnes of terrific stuff—I’ll go with you!",4,18
susan,Ahh!,4,18
ross,"Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so",4,18
emily,Are you all right?,4,18
susan,"Oh, he’s fine. He’s fine. It’s just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn’t like me.",4,18
ross,Oh come on! That’s-that’s… true.,4,18
phoebe,Hi!,4,18
joey,Hey!,4,18
chandler,Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?,4,18
phoebe,"Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book  and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, you know strong and confident, you know? Like-like Exxon.",4,18
chandler,"Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.",4,18
joey,"Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?",4,18
phoebe,"No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with ""The.""",4,18
joey,"Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your buddy. ""Where is everybody?"" ""Well, they’re hanging out with Joey.""",4,18
chandler,"Hey, you know what, if you’re going to do that, if you’re going to name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.  Oh, come on! Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get to know him.",4,18
joey,"Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there.",4,18
chandler,"Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.",4,18
joey,What do you say? What do you say?,4,18
phoebe,"Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.  But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.",4,18
joey,I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!,4,18
rachel,"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.",4,18
monica,you know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes.,4,18
rachel,Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal.,4,18
monica,Um-hmm.,4,18
rachel,What am I making him by the way?,4,18
monica,"Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",4,18
rachel,I thought I was making him filet mignon?,4,18
monica,"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",4,18
rachel,"Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.",4,18
ross,Hey!,4,18
joey,Hey!,4,18
chandler,Hey!,4,18
ross,"So uh, Emily called last night",4,18
chandler,And now you’re giving me the message!,4,18
ross,"Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback riding!",4,18
phoebe,"God, Susan is so fun!",4,18
ross,"Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was",4,18
chandler,You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?,4,18
ross,"Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! you know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best?",4,18
joey,"No, but I’m going to!",4,18
chandler,Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.,4,18
ross,How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!,4,18
phoebe,"Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.",4,18
ross,What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.,4,18
phoebe,No! No! I-I meant for the baby!,4,18
ross,Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?,4,18
phoebe,"Well, it’s just you know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, you know",4,18
ross,"Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…  you know, ugh, never mind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian.",4,18
phoebe,"So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.",4,18
joey,"Oh! Oh-oh, you got to pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.",4,18
chandler,Raymond Chandler.,4,18
joey,Someone you didn’t make up!,4,18
chandler,"Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.",4,18
joey,"Yeah, that guy really hurt us.",4,18
phoebe,"Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like you know, Chanoey?",4,18
chandler,"Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President. There’s never going to be a President Joey.",4,18
joey,"All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely even a word. Okay? It’s kind of like chandelier, but it’s not! All right? It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!",4,18
chandler,"Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.",4,18
joey,"I’m sorry man, I didn’t—I’m-I’m sorry. I’m sorry.",4,18
chandler,Okay.,4,18
joey,So I guess it’s Joey then!,4,18
joshua,This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.,4,18
rachel,"OH, please! Cooking soothes me.  Ahh. So, dig in!",4,18
joshua,"Great! Oh, it all looks so good!",4,18

rachel,"Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.",4,18
joshua,"Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It’s just ah, farm birds really kind of freak me out!",4,18
rachel,"Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.",4,18
joey,"Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.",4,18
rachel,"All gone! So, farm birds, huh?",4,18
joshua,"Yeah, it’s-it’s my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would’ve told you about it, but I didn’t know they would be here.",4,18
rachel,Oh.,4,18
joshua,"So, all right.",4,18
rachel,"Okay. So, can I serve you a little of—What? What? What?",4,18
joshua,"Nothing I uh, it’s just that I know that they’re still out there.",4,18
rachel,"But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.",4,18
joshua,"Okay, that’s-that’s not funny. Uhh.",4,18
rachel,"Okay, you know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and you know go to your apartment.",4,18
joshua,"Oh, they’re working on this week, it’s a total mess. But uh, I’m staying at my parents’ house, we could go there.",4,18
rachel,Your parents’?,4,18
joshua,"Yeah, they’re out of town.",4,18
rachel,OH.,4,18
joshua,"Yeah-yeah, it’s this huge place, and-and it’s got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?",4,18
rachel,Yeah that works.,4,18
joshua,They-they-they can smell fear.,4,18
ross,Hey!,4,18
carol,Hey! How’s Ben?,4,18
ross,"Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, ""No."" I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, ""No."" I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, ""No."" So, he’s sweeping.",4,18
carol,"Hey, Ben! Hey!",4,18
ross,"So umm, any word from Susan?",4,18
carol,"Ooh, yeah! She said she’s having so much fun with Emily.",4,18
ross,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?",4,18
carol,What’s too much fun?,4,18
ross,"you know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.",4,18
carol,"Oh my God, you are so paranoid!",4,18
ross,Am I?!,4,18
carol,Yes!,4,18
ross,Am I?!,4,18
carol,"I can’t speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.",4,18
ross,"Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. you know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, you know, someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?",4,18
carol,Maybe.,4,18
ross,OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!,4,18
joshua,"and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!",4,18
rachel,Wow! This place is fabulous!,4,18
joshua,"Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.",4,18
rachel,"Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.",4,18
joshua,"Yeah, well, it would’ve been, but uh, my parents just moved here.",4,18
rachel,"OH, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. want to make out?",4,18
joshua,"Hey, here’s an idea. Why don’t uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?",4,18
rachel,"That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?",4,18
joshua,"Oh yeah, yeah uh, it’s down the hall and uh, second door to your left.",4,18
rachel,Ah.,4,18
mrs. burgin,"Oh, hi, darling!",4,18
joshua,"Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?",4,18
mrs. burgin,"Oh, well we cut the trip short.",4,18
mr. burgin,France sucks!,4,18

mrs. burgin,"Oh, say no more!",4,18
mr. burgin,"We’ll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we’ll be right out of you hair.",4,18

mrs. burgin,"Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.",4,18
rachel,"What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not—that’s-that’s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so… And obviously in uh, in-in this case,  I am going to report back, ""USA not ready.""",4,18
mrs. burgin,Maybe in L.A?,4,18
rachel,Yes!,4,18
joshua,There you go.,4,18
mr. burgin,"So, have you kids eaten yet?",4,18
rachel,"Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next.",4,18
mr. burgin,"Well, we’re starving, why don’t we all go get something to eat?",4,18
rachel,"Oh, yeah, well… Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lying’ around the house.",4,18
mr. burgin,So… We go eat.,4,18
rachel,Yes.,4,18
mr. burgin,"You’ll wear that. We’ll be eating, and of course, you’ll be wearing that.",4,18
joey,"Dude, I am sorry about what I said!",4,18
chandler,"No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!",4,18
joey,It’s not that bad.,4,18
chandler,"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.",4,18
joey,"So, you’re just Bing?",4,18
chandler,I have no name.,4,18
phoebe,"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?",4,18
chandler,"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.",4,18
joey,No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.,4,18
chandler,"Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?",4,18
phoebe,"Umm, Gene.",4,18
chandler,It’s Clint. It’s Clint!,4,18
joey,"See you later, Gene.",4,18
phoebe,"Bye, Gene.",4,18
chandler,It’s Clint! Clint!,4,18
joey,What’s up with Gene?,4,18
monica,"So, you wore your nightie to dinner?",4,18
rachel,"Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.",4,18
phoebe,Oh my God!,4,18
monica,"Oh, no!",4,18
rachel,"No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs.",4,18
ross,"So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!",4,18
rachel,So?,4,18
ross,So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!,4,18
monica,Emily’s straight.,4,18
ross,"Oh, wake up!",4,18
phoebe,"Wow, Carol really messed you up!",4,18
ross,Excuse me?,4,18
phoebe,"Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant.  All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.",4,18
ross,"Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.",4,18
rachel,Huh.,4,18
ross,What?,4,18
rachel,"She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.",4,18
monica,This totally makes sense!,4,18
ross,It does not!,4,18
monica,"Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!",4,18
phoebe,"All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bam! Paranoid city!",4,18
rachel,Absolutely! Absolutely!,4,18
monica,This is so much fun!,4,18
ross,This is not fun!,4,18
monica,"Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.",4,18
phoebe,Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.,4,18
ross,"Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.",4,18
rachel,"What—yeah—what, you know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.",4,18
phoebe,Drum roll.,4,18
chandler,"Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?",4,18
joey,"Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.",4,18
chandler,"All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3",4,18
phoebe,You’re actually going through with this?,4,18
chandler,"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either going to be Mark Johnson or John Markson.",4,18
phoebe,"You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes,  I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m going to, I’m going to name the baby Chandler.",4,18
chandler,Really?!,4,18
phoebe,"Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!",4,18

ross,Yeah!! Yeah!,4,19
chandler,Easy tiger.,4,19
ross,"I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, ""Well, I’m going to be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off.""",4,19
chandler,So what are you going to do?,4,19
ross,"Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here!",4,19
joey,What?,4,19
ross,I could ask her to live with me!,4,19
chandler,Are you serious?,4,19
ross,"I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!",4,19
chandler,"Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!",4,19
ross,"Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, you know?",4,19
chandler,"And I love the milk! But, I’m not going to some British girl to move in with me!  Joey, you say things now.",4,19
joey,"All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s great! But this way too soon, you’re only going to scare her!",4,19
ross,I don’t want to do that.,4,19
joey,"No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast!",4,19

phoebe,That’s too hard. Too hard!,4,19
monica,"All right boys, last chance for the tickets!",4,19
rachel,"Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.",4,19
chandler,No thank you.,4,19
joey,"Wait-wait-wait-wait!  Come on! Come on, let’s trade! The timing’s perfect, I just clogged the toilet!",4,19
chandler,"Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?",4,19
joey,"Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn’t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!",4,19
chandler,"Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.",4,19
joey,It’s the Knicks!,4,19
chandler,Screw the Knicks!,4,19
joey,Whoa!,4,19
chandler,I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.,4,19
joey,Huh.,4,19
chandler,And the Knicks rule all.,4,19
joey,"Yeah, the Knicks rule all!",4,19
phoebe,"Hey, so? Are you going to do it?",4,19
chandler,"No. No. We’re not going to do that, you know why? Because its not an even trade.",4,19
rachel,"All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?",4,19
joey,Done!,4,19

joey,"Ooh, I like that.",4,19
monica,"All right, so what do you say?",4,19
chandler,No!,4,19
monica,"Oh, just do it!!",4,19
chandler,"Op, op, I’m convinced!",4,19
joey,"Come on man, you know I’d do it for you! Because, you’re my best friend.",4,19
chandler,"All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in.",4,19
joey,All right!,4,19
phoebe,"Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?",4,19
rachel,"Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty.",4,19

emily,We’ve only known each other for six weeks!,4,19
ross,"Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it?

joey,Good night.,4,19
monica,Men are such idiots.,4,19

joshua,What?!,4,20
rachel,"Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like, ""Whoa! Can we do this?"" you know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think?",4,20

rachel,"Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.",4,20
monica,"OH, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he’s going to call you again.",4,20
rachel,"Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. you know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.",4,20
phoebe,"Yeah, maybe.",4,20
rachel,And I-I am just trying to figure out why.,4,20
phoebe,Any luck?,4,20

ross,No. Why?,4,20
rachel,"Well, apparently he scares easy.",4,20

monica,"Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time.  Maybe someday, there will be.",4,20
monica,Oh God! He’s going to come by and borrow some candles for his big date!,4,20
rachel,"Oh, okay!",4,20
monica,"No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!",4,20

chandler,"Phoebe is, making people.",4,21
joey,Everybody’s doing stuff!,4,21

chandler,"Yeah, well",4,21
joey,We could get that Everest video though.,4,21
chandler,"Yeah, we could do that without you know risking our lives at all!",4,21
joey,"And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard!  Oh, you know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.",4,21
chandler,"Oh, well",4,21
phoebe,So you guys will stay here and hang out with me?,4,21

ross,Yeah?,4,21
emily,I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.,4,21
ross,"Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?",4,21

rachel,I knew.,4,21
ross,You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.,4,21
rachel,I did.,4,21
ross,"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here—but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?",4,21

ross,You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.,4,21
rachel,What?,4,21
ross,I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.,4,21
rachel,"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?",4,21
ross,"The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.",4,21
rachel,"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.",4,21

ross,WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!,4,21

ross,"Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I going to do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was going to be a two-week thing, you know no commitment.",4,21
rachel,"Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.",4,21
ross,You think?,4,21
rachel,"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.",4,21
ross,"Hey, you’re right.",4,21
rachel,Yeah.,4,21
monica,"OH, this is so amazing! I can’t believe my brother’s getting married! And in London! It’s so romantic!",4,21

chandler,Hello!,4,21
joey,Hey!,4,21

monica,"Rach, you’re going to come though aren’t you?",4,21
rachel,"Oh, honey, I don’t know. I",4,21
chandler,"This isn’t one of those uh, you know ""If she doesn’t come, we-we don’t, we don’t come?"" Right? Because I already bought my ticket",4,21

phoebe,"Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.",4,21
monica,I can't believe he did this.,4,21

gunther,I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to?,4,21
ross,"You know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?",4,21
rachel,"Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!",4,21
ross,You still love me?,4,21

rachel,"Yeah. It’s just going to be too hard. you know? I mean, it’s Ross. How can I watch him get married? you know it’s just, it’s for the best, you know it is, it’s… you know, plus, somebody’s got to stay here with Phoebe! you know she’s going to be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.",4,21
monica,You don’t have a car. And your license expired.,4,21
rachel,"I know.  Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.",4,21
chandler,"All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!  ""It’s almost as good as being there.""",4,21
joey,It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!,4,21
chandler,"Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.",4,21
joey,"I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!",4,21
chandler,"If we do that, we got to get Die Hard.",4,21

monica,That’s also like the tenth time you told us.,4,22
phoebe,"Yeah, oh I’m sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell you, it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I’m so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, because—Oh! I’m pregnant!",4,22
ross,"Pheebs, did…you want a cookie?",4,22

chandler,"Oh, it’s awkward. It’s awkward. It’s awkward.",4,22
ross,I sort of already asked Chandler.,4,22
joey,What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!,4,22
ross,"Joey, I figured you’d understand. I mean, I-I’ve known him a lot longer.",4,22
joey,"Come on Ross! Look, I-I don’t have any brothers; I’ll never get to be a best man!",4,22
chandler,You can be the best man when I get married.,4,22
joey,I’ll never get to be a best man!,4,22
ross,"Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?",4,22

chandler,"Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.",4,22

monica,Because she’s not going to get to keep the babies.,4,22
rachel,Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!,4,22

rachel,"Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she’s always wanted!",4,22
monica,"Oh, she’s going to love that!",4,22

phoebe,"Hi, guys.",4,22
rachel,Hi! Phoebe.,4,22
monica,Hi Phoebe.,4,22
phoebe,"I-I wanted to apologise if I—you know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. you know it’s just the hormones, you know.",4,22
rachel,No we,4,22
monica,Hormones.,4,22
rachel,"hormones, yeah.",4,22
phoebe,"Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.",4,22
monica,"Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-how are things going?",4,22
phoebe,"Good. you know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?",4,22
rachel,"Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross’s wedding.",4,22
phoebe,Oh!,4,22
rachel,"It just might be too hard, given the history and all that",4,22
phoebe,"Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.",4,22
rachel,"Well, h-how is this like that?",4,22
phoebe,"Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like you know a bunch of you know high school crap that nobody really gives you know",4,22
rachel,"I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that",4,22
phoebe,"Alrighty, here come the water works.",4,22
joey,"Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",4,22
ross,Hey guys!,4,22
chandler,Hey!,4,22
joey,Hey,4,22
ross,"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. you know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so",4,22
joey,"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!",4,22
ross,"Yeah, right!",4,22
joey,"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those",4,22
ross,"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.",4,22
chandler,"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?",4,22
ross,"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.",4,22
chandler,"So you might say, it’s a magic ring.",4,22
joey,"Yeah, the stripper stole it.",4,22
ross,My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!,4,22
chandler,"Well, I think it all started when you said, ""Hey Joey, why don’t you be my best man.""",4,22
ross,"All right-all right, fine! I-I’m going to call the cops!",4,22
joey,"Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!",4,22
ross,Not on you! On the stripper!,4,22
joey,"Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re going to look into it right after they solved all the murders.",4,22
ross,"Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!",4,22
joey,"I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number. They said, ""If I bothered them again they’d call the police."" I said, ""If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!""",4,22
ross,"So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!",4,22
joey,"Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I",4,22
chandler,"Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?",4,22
joey,"Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!",4,22
monica,Here’s your tea Phoebe.,4,22
phoebe,"It’s so good.  Oh, thanks.",4,22
rachel,Good.,4,22
monica,I’m so glad you liked it.,4,22
phoebe,Oh!,4,22
monica,What?!,4,22
rachel,What?! She made the tea!,4,22
phoebe,"Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.",4,22
rachel,You what?,4,22
monica,Oh my God!,4,22
phoebe,"Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.",4,22
monica,"Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out!",4,22
rachel,"Okay. It’s okay. We’re going to be okay. you know what? It’s okay. I’m going to, I’m going to, I’m going to boil some water and just rip up some sheets!",4,22
phoebe,"No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.",4,22
monica,"Rachel, get the book! The book!",4,22
rachel,Okay!  Okay! Here!,4,22
monica,The Bible?!,4,22
rachel,I don’t know!,4,22
joey,"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.  You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’ll be uh, Mr. Wong.",4,22
ross,Diverse.,4,22
the stripper,Did anybody call for security?,4,22
chandler,You be cool.,4,22
the stripper,"Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk?  Hey, Joey?",4,22
ross,Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?,4,22
chandler,"Way to be cool, man.",4,22
the stripper,What’s he talking about?,4,22
joey,"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!",4,22
the stripper,"Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?",4,22
the guys,Yeah!,4,22
ross,We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!,4,22
the stripper,"Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don’t need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?",4,22
chandler,Marry me.,4,22
joey,"I don’t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn’t take it, and I didn’t take it; and you  didn’t take it, then who did?  Shh! We’re trying to think!",4,22
rachel,I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.,4,22
phoebe,"Well, do you see any babies?",4,22
monica,How do you feel?,4,22
phoebe,"Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I know it’s going to be over soon.",4,22
rachel,"Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.",4,22
phoebe,"I know. It’s just you know usually when you’re, when you’re done with the pregnant thing, you know, then you get to do the mom thing. I’m going to be you know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.",4,22
monica,Some moms do that.,4,22
phoebe,"Okay that’s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like I know them you know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not going to be easy when these little babies have to go away.",4,22
monica,"Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not going to have anything. You’re going to have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s even better.",4,22
phoebe,"Yeah, okay.",4,22
rachel,"No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not going to be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, you know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. you know?",4,22
monica,"I mean, you’re the one they’re going to come to when they want to run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.",4,22
rachel,And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!,4,22
phoebe,Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!,4,22
monica,Yeah.,4,22
rachel,"And you know what else, oh my God, are they going to love you.",4,22
phoebe,They are going to love me.,4,22

joey,So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t make it?!,4,22
chandler,"He will, Joe.",4,22
joey,"Yeah, but what if he doesn’t? He’s such a good duck.",4,22
joey,"I’m so worried about him, you know?",4,22
the doctor,Somebody lose a ring?,4,22
ross,Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!,4,22

joey,"OH, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.",4,22
ross,"No, that’s all right.",4,22
joey,"No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!",4,22
chandler,"Hey, come on, it’s not your fault.",4,22
joey,"Yeah, it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? you know what, Ross you were right from the start, he  should be your best man.",4,22

chandler,What a baby.,4,22
ross,Total wuss!,4,22
monica,"Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!",4,23
chandler,Six-hour trip to London. That’s a lot of Monica.,4,23
monica,"Passport, check!  Camera, check! Traveller’s cheques, check!",4,23

phoebe,"Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.",4,23
ross,Hey!,4,23
monica,Hey!,4,23
ross,Hey! Are you ready yet?,4,23
monica,Yep! You got the tickets?,4,23
ross,"Oh! Got ‘them right here,  check!",4,23
joey,"It’s all London, baby! Here we go.",4,23
chandler,You got your passport?,4,23
joey,"Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don’t want to lose that.",4,23
joey,OH!!,4,23
chandler,There it is.,4,23
monica,"Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator",4,23
phoebe,"Okay, okay, but Rachel’s going to be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?",4,23
monica,"Yeah, okay, give that a try!",4,23
chandler,All right! Let’s do it!,4,23
joey,Woo-hoo!!,4,23
ross,"Yeah, cheerie-o!",4,23
joey,London baby!,4,23
chandler,"Okay, because that’s not going to get annoying.",4,23
joey,London baby!!,4,23
chandler,"Hey, you know what? I was wrong.",4,23
ross,"Well, we’re all here! I guess we should get going!",4,23

joey,London baby!!,4,23
phoebe,"Oh, do you need a hug? You don’t have to bring me anything!",4,23
joey,Come on! Do something!,4,23
chandler,"I am, I’m ignoring you.",4,23
joey,"Okay, here!  I want to be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.",4,23
chandler,"Oh, what the hell is that?",4,23
joey,"It’s London, baby! All right, the hotel’s here.  Wait. No, we want to go… No. I know.  I’m going to have to go into the map.",4,23
chandler,"Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!",4,23
joey,I got it!  Here we go.,4,23
chandler,"Okay. Listen-listen, we’re not going to have to walk this way the entire time are we?",4,23
joey,"Shh!  Man, you made me lose it!",4,23
emily,"and that was all before 10 o’clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunnel syndrome. We’re not going to be",4,23
ross,"Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?",4,23
emily,"Well, up yours too!",4,23
ross,What?! No! No! That’s-that’s time-out!,4,23
emily,Sorry.,4,23
ross,"Sweetie, you got to relax. Everything’s going to be great, okay? Come on. Come on.",4,23
monica,Chicken Kiev?,4,23
ross,Um-hmm! Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute?,4,23
monica,"Yeah, you know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn’t have to worry about the salmonella.  So, I can’t wait to see this place you’re getting married!",4,23
ross,"Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily’s parents got married here.",4,23
emily,I still can’t believe they’re tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you’ll ever see. I mean it’s over…  Oh my God!,4,23
monica,It’s nice.,4,23
emily,Oh. Oh.,4,23
emily,Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?,4,23
ross,It’s all right! Everything’s going to be all right.,4,23
emily,How’s it going to be all right?!,4,23
ross,"Uh-huh, I see that.",4,23
monica,"Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.",4,23
ross,What? What?,4,23
monica,They torn it down a few days early.,4,23
joey,"All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I’ve ever seen. Hey!  Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",4,23
chandler,"I think it’s great. It’s great. you know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.",4,23
joey,Really? To what?,4,23
chandler,To Put the Camera Away!!!,4,23
joey,"Man, you are Westminster Crabby.",4,23
phoebe,Oh. Oh.,4,23
rachel,"Oh, honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?",4,23
phoebe,"Oh, no. Oh, nothing.",4,23
rachel,Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.,4,23
phoebe,"Okay, I have a wedgie.",4,23
rachel,"Okay, that is all you.",4,23
phoebe,"So-so, what do you want for lunch?",4,23
rachel,"Oh, I don’t know. I guess we have to eat.",4,23
phoebe,"Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?",4,23
rachel,I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.,4,23
phoebe,"Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married",4,23
rachel,Still in love with?!,4,23
phoebe,Yeah!,4,23
rachel,I’m not in love with Ross!,4,23
phoebe,"Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.",4,23
rachel,"Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I’m still in love with him! I mean, hey, you know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, you know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. you know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—OH! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!",4,23
phoebe,We thought you knew!,4,23
rachel,We?!,4,23
phoebe,"Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!",4,23
rachel,You all know? Does Ross know?,4,23
phoebe,"Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything.",4,23
rachel,"Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!",4,23
phoebe,"Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean.""",4,23
joey,Hey!,4,23
the vendor,"So, what are you guys in the market for? We’ve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...",4,23
joey,Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?,4,23
chandler,"Well, I don’t have to buy that, ""I’m with stupid"" T-shirt anymore.",4,23
joey,"Well, I like it. Here you go.",4,23
chandler,"All right, look, you’re not really going to buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?",4,23
joey,"Oh, I embarrass you?",4,23
chandler,How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?,4,23
the vendor,He’s just jealous. You’ll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!,4,23
chandler,Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?,4,23
the vendor,They’re all tourists.,4,23
chandler,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, you know, you’re going to spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.",4,23
joey,Oh yeah?  If you’re going to make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.,4,23
the vendor,Good choice.,4,23
joey,Thanks.,4,23
chandler,"Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!",4,23
emily,Hello?,4,23
ross,"Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.",4,23
emily,We don’t have to.,4,23
ross,Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?,4,23
emily,"No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.",4,23
ross,She said what?,4,23
emily,"She said, ""If I’m not going to be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.""",4,23
ross,"Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  This isn’t right.",4,23
emily,"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right.",4,23
ross,I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?,4,23
emily,"Don’t you point your pants at me!  We have no choice! Anywhere that’s half-decent would’ve be booked months ago, Ross don’t you understand? This is our wedding I’m talking about.",4,23
ross,The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.,4,23
emily,So what are you saying? It’s now or never?,4,23
ross,No. I’m saying it’s now.,4,23
emily,Or?,4,23
ross,There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!,4,23
emily,"It’s not the pants. It’s you that is backwards. And if, and if you don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn’t get married at all!",4,23
ross,"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—",4,23
phoebe,Hey!,4,23
rachel,Hi.,4,23
phoebe,"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?",4,23
rachel,Manhattan does not have enough stores.,4,23
phoebe,"Well, I think I can help you get over him.",4,23
rachel,You can?,4,23
phoebe,Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.,4,23
rachel,Um-hmm.,4,23
phoebe,And a small piece of chocolate.,4,23
rachel,Okay.,4,23
phoebe,And a glass of tepid water.,4,23
rachel,"Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?",4,23
phoebe,"Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay, I’m going to show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.",4,23
rachel,I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.,4,23
phoebe,"Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just want to say for the record that I love Ross, I think he’s such a great guy. Here.  Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eww-oh gross it’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck! Hah?",4,23
rachel,"I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and you know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.",4,23
phoebe,"Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s try some uh, aversion therapy.",4,23
rachel,Okay.,4,23
phoebe,Okay?,4,23
rachel,All right.,4,23
phoebe,"So uh, now look at the picture",4,23
rachel,Okay.,4,23
phoebe,"All right, and umm",4,23
rachel,Ow!,4,23
phoebe,"Okay, how do you feel now?",4,23
rachel,"Well, I like you less!",4,23
joey,Hey.,4,23
chandler,Hey.,4,23
joey,Oh.  Sorry!,4,23
chandler,"No-no-no, you know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I’ve had a really lousy day.",4,23
joey,Me too.,4,23
chandler,Yeah?,4,23
joey,"No!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!",4,23
monica,Hey!,4,23
joey,Sh-shh-shh!,4,23
joey,"Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.",4,23
fergie,"Okay, so umm, what’s your friend’s name?",4,23
joey,"Oh, Chandler.",4,23
fergie,Hi Chandler!,4,23
chandler,That’s… That’s was,4,23
monica,Oh my God!,4,23
joey,That’s Fergie baby!!,4,23
fergie,"Joey says you don’t really like his hat, but I think it’s kind of dashing.",4,23
chandler,How did you? How? How?,4,23
joey,"Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I’m in my map and-and… Hey!",4,23
monica,Hey!,4,23
ross,Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.,4,23
monica,"Yes, I did! And you are welcome!",4,23
ross,Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!,4,23
monica,Umm,4,23
chandler,I’m going to go to the bathroom.,4,23
joey,Wait up!,4,23
ross,"Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all?",4,23
monica,She said that?!,4,23
ross,Yeah.,4,23
monica,Why?!,4,23
ross,"I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.",4,23
monica,Oh my God. You’re even dumber than I am!,4,23
ross,Excuse me?,4,23
monica,"Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?",4,23
ross,I don’t know. A month?,4,23
monica,"Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That’s what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top.  Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.",4,23
ross,"I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.",4,23
monica,Sometimes we were.,4,23
ross,Come on. You got to help me figure out what to do. Okay?,4,23
monica,Okay.,4,23
ross,Come on.,4,23
chandler,That was pretty intense huh?,4,23
joey,"Yeah.  Hey, I hope Ross didn’t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!",4,23
chandler,I hope he did!,4,23
phoebe,Hello.,4,23
joey,"Hey, Pheebs! It’s Joey!",4,23
phoebe,"Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. And I was going to go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you.",4,23
joey,"That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?",4,23
phoebe,"OH, they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?",4,23
joey,"kind of, but I’ve just been having way too much fun.",4,23
phoebe,So you’re not homesick yet?,4,23
joey,"No, I don’t think so.",4,23
phoebe,"All right, the seven of us miss you.",4,23
joey,Who’s seven?,4,23
phoebe,"you know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies",4,23
joey,"Ahh, the babies miss me?",4,23
phoebe,"Ooh, the pizza guy’s here!",4,23
joey,What? You ordered pizza without me?!,4,23
phoebe,"Yeah. But you know we were thinking about you, you know we ordered the Joey Special.",4,23
joey,Two pizzas?!,4,23
phoebe,"Yep! Okay, got to go, talk to you later.",4,23
joey,"Wait, well, where did you get it from?!",4,23
emily,"Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!",4,23
monica,You’ll see.,4,23
emily,"I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.",4,23
emily,Oh God.,4,23
ross,"Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and you know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles",4,23
monica,"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and…  You go.",4,23
ross,"But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it’s fine, whatever you want.",4,23
emily,It’s perfect.,4,23
ross,"And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain",4,23
emily,Well then we’ll get wet.,4,23
monica,OH. And I don’t even have a date.,4,23
rachel,Pheebs?,4,23
phoebe,Yeah?,4,23
rachel,Do you remember where the duck food is?,4,23
phoebe,"Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink. Why?",4,23
rachel,Because I’m going to London.,4,23
phoebe,What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?,4,23
rachel,"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don’t have those babies until I get back.",4,23
phoebe,"I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!",4,23
rachel,"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.",4,23
phoebe,"That’s not why you’re going! You’re going because you hope he’s going to say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy.""",4,23
rachel,OH—Do you think he will?!,4,23
phoebe,"No! Because he’s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just going to mess with his head and ruin his wedding! you know, it’s too late! You missed you’re chance! I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over.",4,23
rachel,"you know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, ""I do.""",4,23
phoebe,"I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. I’m carrying a litter.",4,23
housekeeper,The Waltham Residence.,4,23
phoebe,Oh...yes.. is this.. umm.. Emily’s Parents’ house.,4,23
housekeeper,"This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses oneself on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.",4,23
phoebe,"This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it’s not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?",4,23
housekeeper,"Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it’s not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.",4,23
phoebe,"No no no, I’ll be nice, I swear!!!   Could you just give me the number for where they are?",4,23
housekeeper,"I’m afraid, I’m not at liberty to divulge that information.",4,23
phoebe,"Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don’t give me that number then I’m going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.",4,23
housekeeper,Hangs up.,4,23
phoebe,"Hello, Hello. OH, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.",4,23

mr. geller,"OH, I thought that you....",4,23

mr. geller,"OH forget it. Too hell with tradition, we’re happy to do it.",4,23
mrs. geller,"We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .",4,23
monica,"Ha ha, a joke that’s funny in all countries.",4,23
waiter,Sir?,4,23

waiter,"Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.",4,23
joey,"That’s not food...No, I don’t, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can’t even remember what Phoebe looks like.",4,23
chandler,"Joey, it’s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.",4,23
joey,Your different here too. Your mean in England.,4,23

rachel,"Oh no, you are the best.",5,2
ross,"OH, I got to go to the flower store!  Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm going to send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That ought to get her talking to me again.",5,2
chandler,"Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.",5,2
monica,"Rach, that is great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!",5,2
rachel,"What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, ""Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?"" I mean, it was so humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.",5,2
chandler,Oh that is not true.,5,2
rachel,"Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.",5,2
phoebe,London is stupid! Stupid!,5,2
rachel,"Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.",5,2
phoebe,"Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.",5,2
monica,I'll do it!,5,2
rachel,"that is fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.",5,2

chandler,"All right, you know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?",5,2
phoebe,"No. I'm sorry. It's just Because I couldn't be there. Because all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.",5,2
all,Sorry.,5,2
monica,What happened?,5,2
rachel,"Well, you know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.",5,2

rachel,"Oh, honey that is awful.",5,2
ross,"Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's going to make potpourri! I think I'm going to go wander out in the rain for a while.",5,2
rachel,"But, it's not raining.",5,2
ross,I can't catch a break!,5,2
rachel,"You know what Ross? you are not going anywhere. you are going to sit right here. I'm going to make you a cup of tea and we're going to talk this thing whole out. All right?  Hey, Dave!",5,2
dave,Yeah?,5,2
rachel,"Umm, listen, I'm going to need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye!  Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.",5,2
monica,Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.,5,2
rachel,Yeah.,5,2

rachel,"Well, ultimately, I was trying you know, I-I wanted…tell him you know, that I'm still in love with him.",5,2
monica,What?!! You cannot tell him that!!,5,2
rachel,Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!,5,2
monica,"I make the decisions, and I say no.",5,2
rachel,"Well, you know what, no, you do not make my decisions because you know what, you are fired.",5,2

rachel,Yes!,5,2
ross,What thing?,5,2
monica,"Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never going to get what she wants, and who knows who she might  end up hurting.",5,2
ross,"Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm going to use the phone. I got to cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.  My God, think of the massacre.",5,2
rachel,I'm going to do it.,5,2
monica,"All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.",5,2

phoebe,Yeah?,5,2
joey,"All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!",5,2
phoebe,"OH, that is so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!",5,2
monica,"Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!",5,2
phoebe,Central… Park!,5,2
joey,"Yeah, all of us! All day!",5,2
phoebe,"That sucks! that is not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we going to high five about at the stupid Central Park? ""Well, it's right by my house, all right!""",5,2
chandler,"Well, I'm going to go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.",5,2
rachel,"Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! you know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—You know—stop it!",5,2

phoebe,"Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that is a great plan! Who's plan was that?",5,2
joey,Mine!,5,2

joey,"No, I said we needed a new plan.",5,2
ross,"And, I came up with Atlantic City.",5,2
joey,"Which, is the new plan!",5,2
monica,"Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?",5,2
phoebe,"Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm going to go pack. I'm going to go pack my ass off!",5,2
monica,"Come on Rach, let's go.",5,2
rachel,"Yeah, you know what? I'm-I'm going to meet you upstairs in a minute.",5,2
monica,"No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.",5,2
rachel,"Well, you know what, that doesn't matter.",5,2
monica,"Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?",5,2
rachel,"Yeah, I-I don't care.",5,2
monica,Okay. I-I can't watch.,5,2
rachel,What are you reading?,5,2

ross,"Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized",5,2
rachel,"Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.",5,2
ross,Yeah.,5,2
rachel,Okay.,5,2
ross,Go ahead.,5,2
rachel,"Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just going to-just going to say it. Just going to say it. Uhh,  I'm still in love with you Ross.",5,2
ross,Wow. Umm… Huh… I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.,5,2
ross,What? What? Was that a joke? Because it's mean.,5,2
rachel,I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.,5,2
ross,Why are you laughing?,5,2
rachel,"Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you are married. you are-you are married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, you know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel  was like, ""You are such an idiot!""",5,2
ross,"Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.",5,2
rachel,"I'm sorry, that is not funny.",5,2
ross,"Actually, it kind of is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is.  ""Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?"" Don't know!",5,2
rachel,"Oh God, oh, okay, you know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?",5,2
ross,"Well, I kind of half to. I mean, because the thing is",5,2
rachel,"The thing is you know, that you are married to Emily.",5,2
ross,That is what the thing is.,5,2
rachel,"Ross, things aren't going to be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?",5,2
ross,"No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.",5,2
rachel,that is what I said! Thank you for being so nice.,5,2

monica,I can't believe Phoebe's going to have her babies!,5,2
chandler,"I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.",5,2
chandler,"You know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.",5,2

phoebe,"Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice.  And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!",5,3
joey,I got to get the before shot!,5,3
rachel,"Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.",5,3
phoebe,What?!,5,3
ross,Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.,5,3
phoebe,"Oh my God, she's so stupid!",5,3
ross,"Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's going to be okay.",5,3
phoebe,"that is easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!",5,3

joey,Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.,5,3
ross,Hello.,5,3
dr. harad,"Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you are going to be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.",5,3
chandler,"Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?",5,3
monica,that is what it sounded like.,5,3
chandler,All right,5,3
frank,Hey!,5,3
all,Hey!,5,3
frank,"Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?",5,3
phoebe,No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?,5,3
frank,"Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm going to be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.",5,3
chandler,"Yeah, that is when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.",5,3
frank,Yeah.,5,3
rachel,Monica? You going to be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.,5,3
joey,Oh my!,5,3
rachel,They're male nurses.,5,3
joey,Not in my head.,5,3
rachel,"Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?",5,3
monica,Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.,5,3
rachel,"What? What are you talking about?! You-you are the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you are moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't want to go.",5,3
monica,"Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.",5,3
rachel,What?,5,3
monica,Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?,5,3
rachel,"Okay, you are coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.",5,3
joey,Yep! There's always room for Jell-O,5,3
rachel,"Joey, how do you make that dirty?",5,3
joey,"Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad",5,3
joey,"Ross! Get a shot of this.  Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies…  Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.",5,3
phoebe,"Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either—Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh!  Oh, I was kind of hoping that was it.",5,3
ross,"Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?",5,3
joey,"Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.",5,3
chandler,Really? Male nurses?,5,3
joey,"Yeah, I was bummed too.",5,3
chandler,So they're going on dates? When?,5,3
joey,I think Saturday—.,5,3
frank,What's with him?,5,3
phoebe,"Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.",5,3
dr. harad,Okay!,5,3
phoebe,Hey.,5,3
dr. harad,"Let's see what we got here. Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.",5,3
chandler,"This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?",5,3
dr. harad,Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.,5,3
chandler,All right.,5,3
frank,"It's not that weird, is it?",5,3
phoebe,"It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm you know, dilatedamundo!",5,3
ross,"To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie",5,3
phoebe,What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!,5,3
ross,"Again, it's not that he",5,3
chandler,Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!,5,3
monica,"Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.",5,3
chandler,"Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, you know, we're nothing, we're goofing' around.",5,3
monica,"Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.",5,3
chandler,Fine! Maybe I will too!,5,3
joey,"Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the gift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up!",5,3
ross,"Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.",5,3
phoebe,Hi! And you are going into what grade?,5,3
dr. oberman,"Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early",5,3
phoebe,"Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.",5,3
dr. oberman,"Oh no, I'm fully qualified to",5,3
phoebe,"Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm going to be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!",5,3
frank,Oh cool! You made him cry!,5,3
doctor,"Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.",5,3
joey,"Umm, well, what else could it be?",5,3
doctor,It's kidney stones.,5,3
joey,Or?,5,3
doctor,Kidney stones!,5,3
dr. harad,"All right, you are getting there. Oh, and you know, these babies are very, very lucky.",5,3
phoebe,They are. Why?,5,3
dr. harad,They have the honour of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.,5,3
phoebe,Happy birthday!,5,3
dr. harad,"Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.",5,3
rachel,"Honey, you know I just got to tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you are having these babies for Frank and Alice.",5,3
phoebe,"I know, it is.",5,3
rachel,Yeah!,5,3
phoebe,Can I tell you a little secret?,5,3
rachel,Yeah!,5,3
phoebe,I want to keep one.,5,3
rachel,"OH, I'm going to be on the news!",5,3
rachel,"Okay, Phoebe, honey, you got to be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!",5,3
phoebe,"Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!",5,3
rachel,"Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are going to want to keep all of their children!",5,3
phoebe,"Maybe not! You know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're you know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! You know?",5,3
rachel,"Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.",5,3
phoebe,"Oh, just ask him!",5,3
rachel,Me?!,5,3
phoebe,"I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, you know, feel him out!",5,3
rachel,No! Forget it! I am not going to ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!,5,3
phoebe,you are right.,5,3
phoebe,Tell him it's for you.,5,3
monica,Feeling a little better sweetie?,5,3
joey,"Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.",5,3
monica,Me too.,5,3
ross,Hey! I just heard. What's up?,5,3
doctor,"Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra",5,3
joey,"Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option—what's a urethra?  Are you crazy?!",5,3
phoebe,So did you ask him?,5,3
rachel,"No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.",5,3
phoebe,"Well, I'm kind of on a clock here.",5,3
dr. harad,Oh Fonzie.,5,3
rachel,You know who I always liked? Mork.,5,3
phoebe,Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.,5,3
dr. harad,Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.,5,3
rachel,"Yeah, but umm… Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?",5,3
dr. harad,"Yeah, that is right.",5,3
monica,Hey!,5,3

monica,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.",5,3
chandler,"You know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just want to spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, you know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.",5,3

phoebe,"But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, you know",5,3
rachel,"Yeah, umm, no honey.",5,3
phoebe,"Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.",5,3
all,"Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.",5,3
phoebe,"So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labour was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favourite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're going to be great. Little high fives!  Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!  Well, if you are going to cry.",5,3
monica,"Phoebe, we are so proud of you! you are amazing!",5,3

rachel,So does it really hurt as bad as they say?,5,3

chandler,"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they going to name her?",5,3
phoebe,They're going to call her Chandler.,5,3
chandler,"that is kind of a masculine name, don't you think?",5,3
phoebe,Works on you.,5,3
monica,Come in. I've been waiting for you.,5,4
rachel,Hi! I just want to--Ah!!! Oh my God!  Oh my God!,5,4
monica,"Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.",5,4
rachel,"Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!",5,4
monica,"Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work.  I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!",5,4
rachel,"That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?",5,4
monica,"Uh-huh, that one!",5,4
rachel,"You know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just going to grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail.  Maybe that is him.",5,4
monica,"Okay, umm, okay, umm…  It's just Joey and Ross.",5,4
rachel,Why aren't you guys at the movie?,5,4
joey,"Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!",5,4
ross,I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!,5,4
joey,He's talking to London!,5,4
monica,But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?,5,4
joey,"Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.",5,4
ross,"I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!",5,4
joey,Ross! Way to suck up to the family.,5,4
chandler,Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!,5,4
joey,Hey!,5,4
chandler,"Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!",5,4
joey,"Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.",5,4
monica,"Vomit tux? Who vomited on—You know what, what you up to Joe?",5,4
joey,"Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!",5,4
monica,Oh that is great!,5,4
joey,"A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that is the kind of math Joey likes to do!",5,4
phoebe,"Ugh, PBS!",5,4
monica,What's wrong with PBS?,5,4
phoebe,"Ugh, what's right with them?",5,4
joey,"Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?",5,4
phoebe,"Okay, Because right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, you know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, Because they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.",5,4
chandler,Well you know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.,5,4
phoebe,All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!,5,4
joey,"I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, you know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.",5,4
phoebe,"This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.",5,4
joey,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!",5,4
phoebe,What-what are you talking about?!,5,4
joey,"Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?",5,4
phoebe,Yeah. So?,5,4
joey,"It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.",5,4
phoebe,Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.,5,4
joey,"Well, may I ask for one example?",5,4
phoebe,"Yeah, it's…you know there's—no you may not!",5,4
joey,that is because all people are selfish.,5,4
phoebe,Are you calling me selfish?!,5,4
joey,"Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?",5,4
phoebe,"I'm going to find a selfless good dead. I'm going to beat you, you evil genius.",5,4
ross,Hello.,5,4
emily,"Hello, Ross?",5,4
ross,"Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily!  It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst!  Hi!",5,4
emily,"Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!",5,4
ross,"No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm going to keep calling! I'm going to, I'm going to call everyone in England if that is what it takes to get you to talk to me!",5,4
emily,Really? About what?,5,4
ross,Look you are my wife. We're-we're married. You know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.,5,4
emily,"I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.",5,4
ross,She's talking.,5,4
all,Yay!,5,4
phoebe,"Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?",5,4
joey,That he doesn't exist.,5,4
phoebe,Right.,5,4
rachel,"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",5,4
chandler,"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",5,4
rachel,"So Mon, when are we going to meet this new secret waiter man?",5,4
monica,"OH, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",5,4
chandler,"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",5,4
rachel,I don’t care! I want to meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!,5,4
chandler,Really?! that is what you heard?  You said that?,5,4
monica,I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,5,4
chandler,"Because I'm very happy for him!  And you, you lucky dog!",5,4
ross,Hi!,5,4
monica,Hey!,5,4
ross,"Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.",5,4
chandler,Yes!,5,4

ross,In London!,5,4
monica,What?!,5,4
ross,She wants me to move to London.,5,4
monica,But you live here!  You know that.,5,4
rachel,What-what-what are you going to do?,5,4
ross,I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.,5,4
monica,"Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.",5,4
ross,It could happen.,5,4
joey,How you doin'? Welcome. Good to see you!,5,4
stage director,This will be your phone.,5,4
joey,"that is great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.",5,4
stage director,No you answer it and take pledges.,5,4
joey,But I'm the host!,5,4
stage director,"No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.",5,4
joey,"You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.",5,4
stage director,"Well, here's your phone doctor.",5,4
phoebe,"I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! You know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!",5,4
rachel,Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.,5,4
phoebe,I will find a selfless good deed! Because I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!,5,4
chandler,"Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?",5,4
monica,Sure!,5,4
chandler,"If you are cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?",5,4
rachel,Chandler!  Is he?,5,4
monica,"Well, you know I-I-I think I'm going to respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.",5,4
chandler,"Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.",5,4
ross,"All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.",5,4
emily,I understand that would be difficult.,5,4
ross,"Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were going to move here anyway, why can't you just do that?",5,4
emily,"I don't know, it's just",5,4
ross,"Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.",5,4
emily,All right.,5,4
ross,"All right, did you just say all right?",5,4
emily,I did. Now I'm the idiot.,5,4
ross,"Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's going to be so great! We're going to be like-like-like two idiots in love!",5,4
emily,"Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.",5,4
ross,"Yes, tell me.",5,4
emily,"Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.",5,4
ross,"I know. I am, I am so sorry.",5,4
emily,"And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.",5,4
ross,"Again, very sorry.",5,4
emily,"I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!",5,4
ross,"Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.",5,4
emily,All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.,5,4
ross,Oh that is so great! that is,5,4
emily,As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.,5,4
ross,"So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.",5,4
chandler,Yes!,5,4
phoebe,Ooh-ooh!,5,4
monica,Great!,5,4
ross,No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.,5,4
phoebe,Why?,5,4
monica,What?! You can't—what did you tell her?,5,4
ross,"I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!",5,4
chandler,"Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.",5,4
monica,"Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that is his wife.",5,4
phoebe,Yeah.,5,4
chandler,that is true!,5,4
phoebe,"Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.",5,4
chandler,that is true!,5,4
monica,"No, you cannot.",5,4
ross,"Thanks for the help, problem solved.",5,4
monica,Hello.,5,4
joey,Hey Mon!,5,4
monica,"Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you going to be on TV?",5,4
joey,"See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that is good exposure.",5,4
monica,you are not on TV.,5,4
joey,"Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?",5,4
chandler,"Hey, there he is! There he is!",5,4
joey,Hello New York!,5,4
emeril,"Now maybe you just like want to but the whole duck in there! Who cares, you know? Now I got the legs",5,4
chandler,"How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!",5,4
monica,Hi Chandler.,5,4
chandler,Hey!,5,4
monica,"Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.",5,4
chandler,"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.",5,4
monica,"William Sonoma, fall catalogue, Page 27.",5,4
chandler,"Expect it in 4-6 weeks.  Umm, hey, umm, Joey's going to be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.",5,4
monica,"Yeah, so?",5,4
chandler,"Well I just, thought maybe you'd want to book some time with the best you'd ever had.",5,4
monica,"You know what, champ? I think I'll pass.",5,4
chandler,Why?,5,4
monica,Why?,5,4
chandler,What's your point?,5,4
joey,PBS telethon.,5,4
phoebe,"Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.",5,4
joey,What?! What good is that going to do anybody?,5,4
phoebe,"Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.",5,4
joey,"Now, you know the bee probably died after he stung you.",5,4
phoebe,"Aw, dammit!",5,4
stage director,Back on in 30 seconds people!,5,4
joey,"Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?",5,4
pbs volunteer,"Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.",5,4
joey,Come on man! You've been here all day!,5,4
pbs volunteer,"Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?",5,4
stage director,"We're on in 3, 2,",5,4
gary collins,"Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil,  and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do  is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to",5,4
ross,"Okay, that is it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just going to leave it entirely to the gods of fate.",5,4
monica,"A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!",5,4
phoebe,"Ooh, it's not a toy.",5,4
ross,"Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! Because I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.  Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?  Ask again later. Later is not good enough.  Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!",5,4
monica,"All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.",5,4
joey,PBS Telethon.,5,4
phoebe,Hi Joey.,5,4
joey,Hey Pheebs!,5,4
phoebe,I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.,5,4
joey,"$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to you?",5,4
phoebe,"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.",5,4
joey,And you don't a little good about donating the money?,5,4
phoebe,"No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.",5,4
joey,"A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.",5,4
phoebe,"Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.",5,4
gary collins,"It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers… Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers,  Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!",5,4
phoebe,"Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel—Oh no!",5,4
chandler,"Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you got to know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.",5,4
monica,Keep talking.,5,4
chandler,"I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD.",5,4
monica,Really?,5,4
chandler,"Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!",5,4
monica,"Well, if we owe it?  Oh my… When is Joey going to be home?",5,4
chandler,"Well, I was kind of hoping we could do this without him.  Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.",5,4
monica,"But, I just cleaned the bathroom.",5,4
chandler,"Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.",5,4
monica,Yeah.,5,4
chandler,"All right, let's show them how it's done.",5,4
monica,Okay.,5,4
monica,Ow!,5,4
chandler,You know that wasn't part of it?,5,4
monica,I know!,5,4
rachel,Hi! Are you ready? We're going to be late!,5,4
ross,For what?,5,4
rachel,For Stella! Remember? She's getting' her grove back in like 20 minutes.,5,4
ross,"Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.",5,4
rachel,"Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!",5,4
ross,"It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.",5,4
rachel,Like what?,5,4
ross,Just stuff. You know kind of what Emily wants.,5,4
rachel,"Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.",5,4
ross,"No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kind of have to do this without your help.",5,4
rachel,"Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to… Hi!",5,4
ross,Thanks.,5,4
rachel,"Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it.  I mean, you are going to have to try. You'll just going to hate yourself if you don't.  Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!",5,4
ross,"Hello.  Hi sweetie.  Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it.  So will you come to New York?",5,4
monica,Never done that before.,5,4
chandler,Nope.,5,4
monica,Hi!,5,5
chandler,Hi!,5,5
joey,Monica? What time is it?,5,5
chandler,"Uhh, 9.",5,5
joey,But it's dark out.,5,5
monica,"Well that is because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",5,5
joey,I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.,5,5
monica,I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.,5,5
chandler,"I know, me too. Hey! you know what if we went away for a whole weekend? You know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.",5,5
monica,All weekend? that is a whole lotta naked.,5,5
chandler,"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.",5,5
monica,"OH, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!",5,5
chandler,"Okay, you know your not though. Let's go.",5,5
monica,Wait! What about Joey?,5,5
monica,"Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.",5,5
phoebe,"Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!",5,5
monica,"Oh now that-that-that is funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.",5,5
chandler,I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.,5,5
ross,Hey.,5,5
joey,Hey!,5,5
monica,Hey.,5,5
ross,Is Rachel here? I got to talk to her.,5,5
monica,"No, she's out shopping.",5,5
ross,Damn!,5,5
chandler,What's going on?,5,5
ross,"I told Emily to come. And I just need to you know, talk to Rachel about it.",5,5
phoebe,"Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you are just, you are not going to see Rachel anymore?",5,5
ross,"Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the ""I get to see my wife,"" part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.",5,5
monica,"Wow, so you guys are, you are never going to be in the same room together? How is that even going to work?",5,5
ross,I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.,5,5
joey,"Doesn’t seem like it's going to work, I mean",5,5
rachel,"Hi, guys!",5,5
joey,Hi!,5,5
chandler,"Uh, hey!",5,5
rachel,What's going on?,5,5
chandler,We're flipping Monica's mattress.,5,5
joey,"So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.",5,5
phoebe,Yeah that is better than my way.,5,5
rachel,"Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?",5,5
chandler,"Aww, man!",5,5
rachel,Oh look! A letter from my mom.,5,5
ross,"So, Rach, you know-You know how Emily's coming right?",5,5
rachel,Oh yeah! I know.,5,5
phoebe,Can you hear anything?,5,5
chandler,"Oh yes, somebody just said, ""Can you hear anything?""",5,5
monica,"Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?",5,5
joey,"Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was going to happen again, so I hid this in here.",5,5
monica,"Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles",5,5
phoebe,"Ooh, Madlibs, mine!",5,5
chandler,Condoms?,5,5
joey,You don't know how long we're going to be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.,5,5
chandler,And condoms are the way to do that?,5,5
ross,"Anyway it-it kind of-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily",5,5
rachel,Oh my God! My dog died!,5,5
ross,What?!,5,5
rachel,"Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!",5,5
ross,Le Poo's still alive?!,5,5
rachel,"Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh.  Oh my God.",5,5
monica,"Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.",5,5
rachel,It's Le Poo.,5,5
phoebe,"I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.",5,5
chandler,I can't believe it! We're here!,5,5
monica,"Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!",5,5
chandler,"Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.",5,5
monica,"Come here.  Okay, be right back.",5,5
chandler,"Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!",5,5
monica,We're switching rooms.,5,5
chandler,"Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!",5,5
monica,"No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.  Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?",5,5
chandler,"Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!",5,5
ross,"Hey, so uh, you know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?",5,5
rachel,Oh yeah!,5,5
ross,"Well, you know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing… Okay,  here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!",5,5
rachel,What?,5,5
ross,you are nose is bleeding!,5,5
rachel,"Oh God.  No! Oh not again!  This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry.  Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?",5,5
ross,Umm,5,5
rachel,Sorry. Sorry.,5,5
ross,"Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.",5,5
rachel,"Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.",5,5
hotel clerk,I think you'll find this room more to your liking.,5,5
chandler,"Okay, great.",5,5
hotel clerk,They say he's only got half a tank left.,5,5
chandler,Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!,5,5
monica,We're switching rooms again.,5,5
chandler,What? Why?,5,5
monica,"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.",5,5
hotel clerk,Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.,5,5
monica,"Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?",5,5
chandler,Uh-huh.,5,5
monica,Chandler!,5,5
chandler,Yeah.,5,5
monica,"Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not going to let them! And we're not a couple of suckers!",5,5
chandler,"I hear you, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.",5,5
monica,"Okay, this one I like!",5,5
chandler,Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!,5,5
monica,Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?,5,5
chandler,"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?",5,5
monica,"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!",5,5
chandler,"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?",5,5
monica,"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!",5,5
chandler,Do not speak ill of the dead.,5,5
monica,"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?",5,5
chandler,"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.",5,5
monica,What did you say?,5,5
chandler,"I said, ""Geez, relax Monnnnn.""",5,5
rachel,Hi!,5,5
ross,"Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.",5,5
rachel,"Okay, what's up?",5,5
ross,"Okay, you know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?",5,5
rachel,"Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.",5,5
ross,"And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants",5,5
rachel,Yeah?,5,5
ross,is for me not to see you anymore.,5,5
rachel,"that is crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her?   Oh God. OH, you already agreed to this, haven't you?",5,5
ross,"It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.",5,5
rachel,"OH! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that is the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!",5,5
ross,You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.,5,5
rachel,"Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.",5,5
ross,What are you doing?,5,5
rachel,Storming out!,5,5
ross,"Rachel, this is your apartment.",5,5
rachel,"Yeah, well that is how mad I am!!",5,5
chandler,Damn Rollos!,5,5
joey,"Hey, you are back!",5,5
chandler,Hey.,5,5
joey,How was your conference?,5,5
chandler,"It was terrible. I fought with  my colleagues you know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?",5,5
joey,"Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?",5,5
chandler,"Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.",5,5
monica,Hi!,5,5
joey,"Hey, you are back too!",5,5
monica,"Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?",5,5
joey,"Hey, how was your chef thing?",5,5
monica,"Oh, it was awful.  I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.",5,5
chandler,"Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhoea.",5,5
monica,Chandler!,5,5
chandler,Monica.,5,5
monica,"Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.",5,5
chandler,"Okay, fine, $300.",5,5
monica,300 dollars?!,5,5
chandler,"Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!",5,5
monica,Urgh!!,5,5
joey,What are you guys woofing about?,5,5
monica,Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!,5,5
joey,"No!!!you know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!",5,5
ross,You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.,5,5
joey,You want my advice?,5,5
ross,Yes! Please!,5,5
joey,you are not going to like it.,5,5
ross,that is okay.,5,5
joey,You got married to fast.,5,5
ross,that is not advice!,5,5
joey,I told you.,5,5
ross,I'm going to the bathroom.,5,5
joey,"Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.",5,5
chandler and phoebe,"Yeah, me either.",5,5
monica,Maybe I could do it.,5,5
rachel,Hi!,5,5
joey,"Hi, Rach.",5,5
chandler,Hi!,5,5
phoebe,Hey.,5,5
monica,Hey.,5,5
rachel,"Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but you know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?",5,5
joey,"I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.",5,5
rachel,that is not Ross!,5,5
phoebe,Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.,5,5
chandler,"Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.",5,5
rachel,"Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.",5,5
joey,"Hey, you are not Kip!",5,5
rachel,Do you even know who Kip is?,5,5
joey,Who cares? you are Rachel!  Who's Kip?,5,5
chandler,"Kip, my old roommate, you know we all used to hang out together.",5,5
joey,"Oh, that poor bastard.",5,5
rachel,"See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!",5,5
monica,you are not going to be phased out!,5,5
rachel,"Well, of course I am! It's not going to happen to Ross! He's your brother.  He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.",5,5
phoebe,Eh!!,5,5
rachel,"Honey, come on! You live far away! you are not related. You lift right out.",5,5
chandler,Hey!,5,5
joey,"Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.",5,5
chandler,Yes that was mine.,5,5
joey,because I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.,5,5
chandler,Yes that would have made more sense.,5,5
joey,"You know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just going to ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe you.  Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!",5,5
rachel,Phoebe?  I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing.  You got to come with me!,5,5
phoebe,Come where?,5,5
rachel,"Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.",5,5
phoebe,"Okay, but try and get Joey too.",5,5
ross,"Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?",5,5
phoebe,"Oh, sure!  Bye Ross!  Forever.",5,5
ross,Hi.,5,5
rachel,Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?,5,5
ross,"I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to you know, step back.",5,5
rachel,"Oh, Ross",5,5
ross,"No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?",5,5
rachel,"No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.",5,5
ross,"Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?",5,5
rachel,"Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!",5,5
ross,I can't believe this is happening.,5,5
rachel,I know.,5,5
ross,I am so sorry.,5,5
rachel,I know that too.,5,5
joey,"Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.",5,5
chandler,Hey!,5,5
monica,Hi.,5,5
chandler,"I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kind of sucked, huh?",5,5
monica,"Yeah, it did.",5,5
chandler,"So, I guess this is over.",5,5
monica,What?,5,5
chandler,"Well, you know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",5,5
monica,"Why, exactly?",5,5
chandler,"Because of the weekend, we had a fight.",5,5
monica,Chandler that is crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—oh!,5,5
chandler,"So, this isn't over?",5,5
monica,"You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.",5,5
chandler,Really? Okay. Great!,5,5
monica,"OH, welcome to an adult relationship!",5,5
chandler,We're in a relationship?,5,5
monica,I'm afraid so.,5,5
chandler,Okay.,5,5
phoebe,Hey!,5,5
monica,Hey!,5,5
phoebe,"Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.",5,5
monica,"Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.",5,5
monica,"Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.",5,5
rachel,"Yeah, it's in there.",5,5
joey,Oh! OH! Oh!!,5,5
chandler,"Joey, can I talk to you for a second?",5,5
joey,Ooh!! OH! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!,5,5
joey,oh!!!!!!!,5,5
chandler,Yes. Yes.,5,5
joey,You?!  And-and you?!,5,5
monica,"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!",5,5
joey,How?! When?!,5,5
chandler,It happened in London.,5,5
joey,IN LONDON!!!,5,5
chandler,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.,5,5
joey,But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!,5,5
chandler,No-no-no-no-no! You can't!,5,5
monica,"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.",5,5
joey,"All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but",5,5
monica,"I know, it's great!",5,5
joey,"Aww, I don't want to see that!",5,5
phoebe,We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!,5,5
phoebe,"The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, ""Hi, Phoebe!""",5,5
monica,"Oh that is cute! We really all enjoyed it. But you know, it doesn't count.",5,5
phoebe,Count for what?,5,5
monica,Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.,5,5
joey,I guess I'm done.,5,5
chandler,Fun's over!,5,5
monica,"Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!",5,5
rachel,Uh-huh!,5,5
joey,I think I'm going to take-off.,5,5
monica,"Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!  oh!",5,5
joey,"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you are living under my roof!",5,6
monica,What?!,5,6
joey,"Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.",5,6
chandler,Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?,5,6
joey,"Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman!  And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are going to have to pretend there's nothing to know about.",5,6
chandler and monica,Okay.,5,6
monica,Sorry.,5,6
chandler,Sorry.,5,6
joey,I can hear that!,5,6
monica,Rachel's at work.,5,6
joey,I can still hear you!,5,6
phoebe,Hey!,5,6
joey,Hey!,5,6
chandler,Hello!,5,6
monica,"Hey, what's that?",5,6
phoebe,"Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.",5,6
phoebe,Eeeee--ooh!! God!,5,6
joey,"Argh-argh!!  Ooh, soft. Is this mink?",5,6
phoebe,"Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!",5,6
chandler,"Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up!",5,6
ross,Hey!,5,6
gunther,"Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.",5,6
ross,How come? Everybody else does.,5,6
gunther,You can't.,5,6
monica,What is that?,5,6
ross,"Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.",5,6
monica,This is all of your things.,5,6
ross,"Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that is just ours, together. You know brand new.",5,6
monica,"So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.",5,6
ross,Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.,5,6
gunther,I'll take it all.,5,6
joey,"Hey, Ross, you are okay with that?",5,6
ross,"Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.",5,6
chandler,"Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?",5,6
ross,After what I did? Can you blame her?,5,6
phoebe,"Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.",5,6
joey,"What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?",5,6
monica,Now calm down Joey.,5,6
joey,"No! Everything's getting' all messed up, you know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not going to stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!",5,6
phoebe,"Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.",5,6
chandler,"Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence",5,6
monica,"Look, I'm not happy about this either, but you know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just going to have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?",5,6
joey,"No! But you know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.",5,6
rachel,"OH, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?",5,6
monica,"Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you got to have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.",5,6
rachel,I want the little round waffles.,5,6
monica,"All right.  Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?",5,6
rachel,"Okay, you know what? I'll-I'll have toast!",5,6
rachel,Argh!!!!!!,5,6
monica,Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!,5,6
phoebe,I don't know what I'm going to do about this coat.,5,6
joey,I'll take it!,5,6
phoebe,That might work!,5,6
joey,"Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  Enh? All right, what do you think?",5,6
chandler,you are on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.,5,6
ross,"No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden.  No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.",5,6
joey,What's the matter Ross?,5,6
ross,"Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!",5,6
phoebe,Why?,5,6
ross,"Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.",5,6
joey,that is way uptown! that is like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail!,5,6
chandler,So you are really okay with this?,5,6
ross,"Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kind of far from work, but uh, you know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!",5,6
chandler,"Now that is so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.",5,6
joey,"Now he's moving'? Man, what is Emily doing to him?  Ow!! He's not even here!!!",5,6
rachel,You guys! You guys!,5,6
monica,"We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!",5,6
rachel,"It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!",5,6
monica,"And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!",5,6
rachel,"Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!",5,6
joey,"Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?",5,6
rachel,Yeah!,5,6
joey,"Yeah, you fogged Danny.",5,6
rachel,Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?,5,6
joey,"Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.",5,6
monica,"Oh he's nice. He's nice! You know, you always stick up for the people we fog!",5,6
danny,Yeah?,5,6
rachel,"Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.",5,6
monica,We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.,5,6
danny,Okay.,5,6
rachel,"Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.",5,6
danny,Okay.,5,6
danny,Yes?,5,6
rachel,"Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.",5,6
monica,Yeah.,5,6
danny,O-kay!,5,6
monica,Wow! That guy is so rude!,5,6
rachel,Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.,5,6
monica,Well you did a little bit.,5,6
rachel,"Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!",5,6
monica,I totally forgive you!,5,6
rachel,Really?,5,6
monica,Yes!,5,6
phoebe,Hey!,5,6
monica,Hey!,5,6
phoebe,"So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?",5,6
monica,Crematorium Chris? Sure!,5,6
phoebe,"He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, you know, bring in the next person I know who dies.",5,6
rachel,"Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!",5,6
monica,"Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.",5,6
rachel,"What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you are quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!",5,6
phoebe,"This is fashion?!  Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! that is really funny.  Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, you know, cutting edge hairy carcass from you know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? Because I do.",5,6
ross,I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.,5,6
chandler,"Okay, what is in here? Rocks?",5,6
ross,"No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.",5,6
chandler,"So, rocks.",5,6
ross,"I'm really going to miss this apartment. You know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.",5,6
joey,"OH. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kind of knocked me out a little?",5,6
ross,"I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.",5,6
joey,"Uhh, are you saying that you are not entirely happy about this?",5,6
ross,"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice",5,6
joey,"You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!",5,6
ross,Why?,5,6
joey,"It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Ow!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.",5,6
ross,What's going on?,5,6
joey,We all hate Emily!,5,6
phoebe,No!!,5,6
monica,"No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you are having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.",5,6
joey,Yeah!,5,6
chandler,"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.",5,6
joey,Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!,5,6
ross,"Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!",5,6
phoebe,I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.,5,6
monica,"God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",5,6
phoebe,"Oh, I know.",5,6
joey,I kind of feel like it's my fault.,5,6
chandler,Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.,5,6
joey,"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!",5,6
chandler,"Well, I think it's very brave what you said.",5,6
phoebe,"All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.",5,6
chandler,"Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?",5,6
phoebe,"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I—it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!  Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!",5,6
rachel,Hi!,5,6
danny,So you like the short hair better.,5,6
rachel,What? Yeti—I mean Danny?,5,6
danny,"I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.",5,6
rachel,"Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if you know if you hadn't looked so….you know.",5,6
danny,Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.,5,6
rachel,What?,5,6
danny,that is cool. Cool.,5,6
rachel,What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!,5,6
danny,"Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalogue.",5,6
rachel,"So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! You know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!",5,6
danny,Do you?,5,6
rachel,"Well, you know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.",5,6
danny,Okay.,5,6
rachel,And stop saying that! I hate that!,5,6
danny,Okay!,5,6
rachel,Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you are wrong! What does that say about you?,5,6
danny,The pizza-place across the street any good?,5,6
rachel,What?!,5,6
danny,I'm hungry. want to get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.,5,6
rachel,Okay. Okay.,5,6
danny,Stop saying that. I hate that.,5,6
chandler,"Uh, Ross?",5,6
phoebe,Are you still mad at us?,5,6
ross,Yep.,5,6
phoebe,"Oh good! Because we have an ""I'm sorry"" song.",5,6
ross,You know what? I'm really not in the mood.,5,6
joey,"Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you are going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.",5,6
chandler,"Yeah, we are so sorry.",5,6
phoebe,you are kind of stepping on the song.,5,6
joey,"Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.",5,6
monica,"Whatever you decide, whatever you do.",5,6
phoebe,"Okay, now you are just taking lines right out of the song!",5,6
ross,"Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.",5,6
phoebe,Yes! Exactly! And that is why,5,6
monica,Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favourite dinner.,5,6
ross,Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?,5,6
phoebe,"Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!",5,6
joey,"Hey, you know Ross, I think I kind of understand why I kind of lost it today.",5,6
ross,"You do, huh?",5,6
joey,"Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I got to keep my emotions right at the surface you know? See what I'm saying? I got to lot of balls in the air. you know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, you know, you wander around, you are alone",5,6
ross,What are you talking about?,5,6
joey,I'm not sure.,5,6
rachel,Hi!,5,6
monica,"Hey, look at you! Where have you been?",5,6
rachel,"Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.",5,6
monica,How did that happen?,5,6
rachel,That yeti is one smooth talker.,5,6
monica,"I hope you are not full, Because dinner's almost ready.",5,6
rachel,"Yeah, you know I-I think I'm just going to hang out in my room.",5,6
all,No! Why?,5,6
rachel,"Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really… I don't mind.",5,6
ross,Wait! Wait! Wait! You know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.,5,6
rachel,"Ross, I",5,6
joey,RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!,5,6
rachel,"Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.",5,6
joey,"All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor",5,6
ross,"Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!",5,6
rachel,I haven't seen him in so long!,5,6
phoebe,"Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!",5,6
monica,"Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.",5,6
joey,It's almost as if he knew.,5,6
monica,"I'll get it.  Hello.  Hi Emily!  Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.",5,6
ross,"Hey!  Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner.  Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on.  She wants to say hi.  Hold on.",5,6
phoebe,Hi Emily!,5,6
chandler,Hi!,5,6
emily,Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?,5,6
joey,"Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that is Rachel!!",5,6
emily,"Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.",5,6
ross,"You know what? Uh, Rachel is here!",5,6
emily,She's there?!,5,6
chandler,"Oh yeah, there-there she is!",5,6
ross,"Yeah, yeah, she's here.",5,6
emily,"Ross, take me off speakerphone.",5,6
ross,Hi.,5,6
emily,How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!,5,6
ross,"Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?",5,6
emily,You obviously can't keep away from her.,5,6
ross,"Emily that is ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you are the only person I want to be with.",5,6
emily,"I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.",5,6
ross,"Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never going to work if you don't trust me.",5,6
emily,you are right.,5,6
ross,"So, can you trust me?",5,6
emily,No.,5,6
joey,I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.,5,6
monica,How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!,5,6
joey,"You can totally tell! Here look, watch me.  Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown.  Smile!",5,6
ross,"Well, I guess that is it.",5,6
all,"Why, what happened?",5,6
joey,What happened? What happened?,5,6
ross,My marriage is over.,5,6
all,What?!,5,6
monica,"Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. you are shivering.",5,6
phoebe,Here.,5,6
rachel,"Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?",5,6
ross,Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.,5,6
phoebe,"Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And you know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats!  All right, fine, now I get it.  Here.  You take it.  Are you happy now? I'm cold!",5,6
chandler,Are you looking at naked tribe's women?,5,7
joey,"No, look.",5,7
chandler,that is a pig.,5,7
joey,"I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.",5,7
chandler,Hey!,5,7
ross,Emily's cousin kicked me out!,5,7
chandler,What?!,5,7
joey,Why?,5,7
ross,"Well, when you are subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.",5,7
chandler,How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?,5,7
ross,Who needs a lease when it's family!,5,7
joey,"Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of you!",5,7
chandler,"Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!",5,7
joey,Yeah.,5,7
ross,You got it.,5,7
joey,Okay.,5,7
ross,"Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm going to get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.",5,7
ross,What?,5,7
chandler,He thought you said gonad.,5,7
health inspector,"Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.",5,7
monica,"Oh, Larry.",5,7
phoebe,"Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?",5,7
larry,"No, bribes.",5,7
phoebe,It's okay to laugh right?,5,7
larry,"Yeah, I was just kidding.",5,7
phoebe,Okay.,5,7
larry,I'll check the kitchen floors.,5,7
monica,"Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.",5,7
phoebe,Yum-my!,5,7
monica,Larry?,5,7
phoebe,Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.,5,7
larry,"A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.",5,7
monica,"Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you are in the kitchen.",5,7
larry,And where is your hat?,5,7
monica,"It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.",5,7
larry,Ahh that is the 2 points.,5,7
phoebe,"Hey, you should really read that book you wrote.  Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!",5,7
larry,"Oh, I don't know about that.",5,7
phoebe,"Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.",5,7
larry,"Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.",5,7
phoebe,"Okay, she would love that! You know, Because you know all the clean places to eat.",5,7
larry,I-I'll call you.,5,7
phoebe,Okay.,5,7
phoebe,He's so funny!,5,7
monica,Thanks.,5,7
rachel,Thank you.  Mon?,5,7
monica,Hmm?,5,7
rachel,How's Ross doing? You know since all the Emily stuff.,5,7
monica,"He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you are not going to try",5,7
rachel,"Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's going to screwed up for a long time. And besides you know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.",5,7
monica,"Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.",5,7
danny,Two pounds of Moca Java please.,5,7
monica,Danny. Are you guys ever going to go out again?,5,7
rachel,"I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.",5,7
danny,Hey!,5,7
rachel,Hi Danny!  Wow! Thirsty huh?,5,7
danny,"Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.",5,7
monica,"OH, fun!",5,7
rachel,"OH, great!",5,7
danny,"Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.",5,7
rachel,Yeah.,5,7
danny,"Okay, see you.",5,7
monica,"Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.",5,7
rachel,"Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.",5,7
monica,And you are not going to do that.,5,7
rachel,"that is right! Because that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing you know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?",5,7
monica,So-so there is no party.,5,7
rachel,"No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?",5,7
monica,"I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.",5,7

joey,"Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.",5,7

danny,Take care.,5,7
rachel,Okay.  Walked right into that one didn't he?,5,7
monica,What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!,5,7
rachel,"Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, ""No!"" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.",5,7
monica,Great. So the ball is in his court?,5,7
rachel,Ball? There is no ball.,5,7
ross,"Joey, please!",5,7

chandler,Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?,5,7
joey,"No, the quiet down thing!",5,7
chandler,You mean this.,5,7
joey,"Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?",5,7
chandler,"All right look, you know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!",5,7
joey,"All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.",5,7
chandler,Okay.,5,7
chandler,No-no-no-no!,5,7

joey,You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!,5,7
phoebe,"Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!",5,7
joey,"Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favourite places, where are we going to eat?!",5,7
monica,"I don't know, clean places?",5,7
joey,"Umm, yum!",5,7
monica,It's Danny.,5,7
rachel,Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.,5,7
monica,We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?,5,7
rachel,What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!,5,7
monica,The fake kind!,5,7
danny,"Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?",5,7
monica,We have a ladle.,5,7
danny,"Thanks, see you at the party.",5,7
monica,"Okay, great!",5,7
phoebe,"Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, ""See you ladle.""",5,7
chandler,"Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?",5,7
ross,I'll take sports.,5,7
joey,Mine!,5,7
ross,"All right. Uhh, international.",5,7
joey,Oh that is mine too!  I'm Italian!,5,7
ross,"Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.",5,7
chandler,Not even on page 7?,5,7
ross,"Oh yeah! you are—hey, you are right! Here's an affordable place,  two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!",5,7
chandler,What about that circled one?,5,7
ross,"Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.",5,7
joey,But it's available now! Isn't it?,5,7
chandler,"Yes, it is.",5,7
joey,"Hey, let's go look at it!",5,7
ross,"Okay, let's go.",5,7
joey,Okay!,5,7
chandler,There we go!,5,7
ross,"Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.",5,7
chandler,Let's go quicker.,5,7
joey,Yeah!,5,7
ross,Oh my God!,5,7
chandler,"Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that is great! You know so you can cook while in the tub.",5,7
joey,"Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.",5,7
ross,"I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.",5,7
joey,"But hey, Ross, this place is available now!",5,7
chandler,"Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.",5,7
joey,Yeah.,5,7
ross,"So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?",5,7
joey,"Oh, it's perfect!",5,7
ross,How about you?,5,7
chandler,It's a kitchen slash bathroom.,5,7
ross,"All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.",5,7
chandler,We are bad people.,5,7
joey,He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew!  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?,5,7
larry,"Hey, ready for dinner?",5,7
phoebe,"Ooh, absolutely!",5,7
larry,Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?,5,7
phoebe,"Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.",5,7
larry,How about Mama Lisettie's?,5,7
phoebe,Enh. Sure!,5,7
larry,I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.,5,7
phoebe,"Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. I bought this today, Because I was thirsty for milk, you know.  Okay, let's go!",5,7
larry,"Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?",5,7
gunther,But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.,5,7
larry,"Oh, so you are saying you'd choose convenience over health?!",5,7
phoebe,"Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? You know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we going to eat ever?",5,7
larry,"Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.",5,7
phoebe,"Thank you.  Okay, go! Go! Go!   Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.",5,7
joey,"Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!",5,7
chandler,Yes that was a nice place!,5,7
joey,Yeah!,5,7
chandler,"Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!",5,7
joey,Yeah!,5,7
chandler,What are we going to do?,5,7
joey,I don't know. Maybe pizza?,5,7
chandler,About Ross!,5,7
joey,Oh! Oh!,5,7
joey,"Hello!  Oh yeah!  It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references.  Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.",5,7
chandler,"Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night.  Well, who doesn't love dogs?  Ah, he's a tap dancer!  Yes, some would say that is a lost art.  He's a pimp!  There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp!  Hello?",5,7
chandler,oh!,5,7
rachel,"Shoot, shoot, this is never going to work! He's right there!",5,7
monica,Just go over and say hi.,5,7
rachel,"No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.",5,7
monica,"Hey, Danny!",5,7
danny,Hey! What's going on?,5,7
monica,"Oh, it's a great party! Great food. You know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa.   So umm, what's this?",5,7

danny,"Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.",5,7
rachel,"Yeah, sure.  All right, whose court is the ball in now?",5,7
monica,I thought there wasn't a ball?,5,7
rachel,"Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!",5,7
danny,"Rachel, this is my friend Tom.  This is the girl I told you about.",5,7
rachel,"Oh, go on! You telling people about me?",5,7
danny,You two could really hit it off! I'm going to go mingle.,5,7
tom,"So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.",5,7
rachel,"Yeah, okay, at ease solider!",5,7
tom,I'm sorry?,5,7
rachel,"No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!",5,7
tom,"I'm going to go talk to uh, a friend.",5,7
rachel,"Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, ""Nice try.""",5,7
rachel,Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!,5,7
monica,I think I need a drink.,5,7
rachel,Yeah!,5,7
chandler,"98. 99. 100. Okay, go!",5,7
joey,"Dude, I'm telling you! I'm fine!",5,7
chandler,Here we go! Here we go!,5,7
joey,Hey!,5,7
chandler,Hey!,5,7
ross,"Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.",5,7
joey,you are kidding!,5,7
chandler,"you are kidding, no!",5,7
ross,"Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So",5,7
joey,"But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!",5,7
ross,"Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.",5,7
joey,"Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there  by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!",5,7
chandler,Yeah!,5,7
ross,Are you guys sure about this?,5,7
joey,Definitely!,5,7
chandler,"Yes! Ross, you have to stay!",5,7
ross,All right.,5,7
joey,All right!,5,7
chandler,"All right, buddy!",5,7
ross,"So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .",5,7
chandler,"Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?",5,7
ross,"Come on, it's fun!",5,7
chandler,All right!  Isn't this a woman's hat?,5,7
joey,"Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!",5,7
rachel,Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.,5,8
ross,I couldn't possibly eat another bite.,5,8
joey,I need something sweet.,5,8
phoebe,Does anyone want to watch TV?,5,8
all,"Yeah, sure.",5,8
phoebe,Monica your remote doesn't work.,5,8
monica,"Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.",5,8
phoebe,"Oh. Aw, forget it.",5,8
rachel,"Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.",5,8
joey,"Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.",5,8
monica,that is very nice.,5,8
chandler,"that is sweet, Joey.",5,8
joey,"Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.",5,8
joey,"I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?",5,8
chandler,Are you aware that you are still talking?,5,8
monica,Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?,5,8
ross,"Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.",5,8
phoebe,"Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.",5,8
ross,I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.,5,8
chandler,No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.,5,8
rachel,"Oh, you are not going to tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?",5,8
ross,"Oh God, no.",5,8
joey,"Oh, come on! I want to hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!",5,8
chandler,"It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.",5,8
mrs. bing,"Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.",5,8
the housekeeper,More turkey Mr. Chandler?,5,8
ross,you are right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.,5,8
phoebe,I don't know about that. I've got one that is worse.,5,8
chandler,"Really? Worse than, ""More turkey Mr. Chandler?""",5,8
phoebe,"Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!",5,8
past life phoebe,"More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying— Oh no.",5,8
ross,"In this life, Phoebe.",5,8
phoebe,"Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.",5,8
joey,"Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.",5,8
phoebe,Of course you don't sweetie. you are brand new.,5,8
rachel,I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.,5,8
monica,"Oh, let's not tell this story.",5,8
all,"Oh, come on!",5,8
phoebe,"Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!",5,8
rachel,What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!,5,8
joey,"Hey, it's not like it sounds.",5,8
chandler,It's exactly like it sounds.,5,8
joey,Hello?,5,8
phoebe,Hello?,5,8
joey,Phoebe?,5,8
phoebe,Joey? What's going on?,5,8
joey,Look.,5,8
phoebe,Oh my God!,5,8
joey,I know! It's stuck!!!,5,8
phoebe,Easy. Step. How did it get on?,5,8
joey,I put it on to scare Chandler!,5,8
phoebe,Oh my God! Monica's going to totally freak out!,5,8
joey,"Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.",5,8
phoebe,"Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.",5,8
monica,Hey!,5,8
phoebe,Hey!,5,8
monica,"Hey, did you get the turkey basted—Oh my God! Oh my God!  Who is that?",5,8
joey,It's Joey.,5,8
monica,What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?,5,8
phoebe,"No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.",5,8
monica,"Well, get it off now!",5,8
joey,I can't! It-it's stuck!,5,8
monica,"Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not going to eat it off your head!",5,8
phoebe,"All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.",5,8
monica,"Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm going to spread the legs as wide as I can.  Joey? Now is not the time!",5,8
joey,Sorry! Sorry.,5,8
monica,"Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!",5,8
chandler,Argh!!,5,8
joey,"It worked! I scared you, I knew it! Ha-ha!",5,8
chandler,I'm over here big guy.,5,8
joey,"Yeah, you are!  I scared you!",5,8
chandler,You did look like an idiot.,5,8
joey,"Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, ""Butternut squash?"" And it came out, ""Squatternut buash?""",5,8
ross,Yeah that is the same.,5,8
monica,that is it. that is my worse Thanksgiving.,5,8
phoebe,Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?,5,8
all,Which one?,5,8
monica,"Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.",5,8
chandler,"Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. You know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.",5,8
monica,"Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!",5,8
mrs. geller,Monica! I think Rachel's here!,5,8
monica,I'll get it!  Happy Thanksgiving!,5,8
big nosed rachel,Not for me. Chip and I broke up!,5,8
fat monica,"Oh, why? Why? What happened?",5,8
big nosed rachel,"Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over",5,8
fat monica,"Yeah, yeah, and you were going him you know, your flower.",5,8
big nosed rachel,"Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me!  Hi!",5,8
mr. geller,Hi Rachel!,5,8
big nosed rachel,Happy Thanksgiving!,5,8
mrs. geller,You too sweetheart!,5,8
ross,Hey!,5,8

ross,"Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!",5,8
fat monica,Ross!,5,8
ross,"Oh, this is Monica.",5,8
fat monica,"Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.",5,8
chandler,Okay.,5,8
mrs. geller,"I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you are hungry.",5,8
ross,"Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.",5,8
mrs. geller,"Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.",5,8
fat monica,"Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.",5,8
chandler,"Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.",5,8
fat monica,dammit!,5,8
ross,"So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? You know since I've been away at college.",5,8
big nosed rachel,"Oh! No, not really.",5,8
ross,"Well, that is cool. So did",5,8
big nosed rachel,Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!,5,8
fat monica,I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.,5,8
big nosed rachel,"You know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly.  Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!",5,8
ross,"Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.",5,8
fat monica,Call them mom and dad you loser!,5,8
ross,Monica!,5,8
fat monica,Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?,5,8
chandler,"Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.",5,8
fat monica,Okay!,5,8
big nosed rachel,Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumour so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!,5,8
fat monica,Oh that is so great!,5,8
big nosed rachel,I know!,5,8
fat monica,"Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.",5,8
big nosed rachel,"Oh totally, totally. You know it's not that big of deal, we already kind of did it once you know.",5,8
fat monica,"I know, but you know, this time you are going to definitely know whether or not you did it!",5,8
big nosed rachel,"I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!",5,8
ross,So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. You know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.,5,8
chandler,Emotional Knapsack?,5,8
ross,Yeah.,5,8
chandler,"Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? Because uh, we're going to test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.",5,8
ross,"Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m going to be out with her all night.",5,8
chandler,"Dude, don't do that too me!",5,8
ross,"All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.",5,8
chandler,"No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.",5,8
ross,Hey!,5,8
mrs. geller,"Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.",5,8
fat monica,"No. No, thank you!",5,8
mr. geller,"Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!",5,8
chandler,I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!,5,8
monica,"Well, I do.",5,8
chandler,I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!,5,8
phoebe,"Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.",5,8
ross,I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.,5,8
chandler,"I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.",5,8
rachel,"Actually, you know that is not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.",5,8
monica,"Yes, it was!",5,8
rachel,"No, it wasn't. It was actually the",5,8
monica,"Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!",5,8
phoebe,"Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!",5,8
chandler,We want to hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!,5,8
phoebe,"Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but you know whatever.",5,8
mrs. geller,"So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.",5,8
rachel,"Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.",5,8
mr. geller,Hi Rachel.,5,8

monica,Well it didn't!,5,8
rachel,What?!,5,8
monica,"Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! you know I still don't feel like I got him back, you know? I just want to humiliate him. I want to, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!",5,8
rachel,"Okay, that we may be able to do.",5,8
monica,How?,5,8
rachel,Well guys tend to get naked before they're going to have sex.,5,8
monica,"What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!",5,8
rachel,"Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's going to ever take it. Then, second of all you are not actually going to have sex with him! you are just going to make him think that you are.",5,8
monica,Yeah.,5,8
rachel,Yeah.,5,8
monica,And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbours will just humiliate him!,5,8
rachel,"Then, you will definitely get him back!",5,8
monica,"Okay, so how do I make him think I want to have sex with him?",5,8
rachel,"Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.",5,8
monica,What do you mean?,5,8
rachel,"Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!  Ooh, ooh, this feels so good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.",5,8
monica,I can do that!,5,8
rachel,"Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming.  Hey, what's up?",5,8
chandler,"Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.",5,8
monica,"Umm, I'd love too!  Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.",5,8
chandler,Okay.,5,8
monica,"Boy, I love carrots! Oh!  Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you.  Umm, and-and-and you know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife  and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm,  my body.",5,8
chandler,Are you all right?,5,8
monica,"Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that—",5,8
the doctor,What do we got here?,5,8
the paramedic,Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.,5,8
ross,"Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!",5,8
the doctor,It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.,5,8
mr. geller,Of course it did. They're made of wicker.,5,8
the doctor,Did you bring the toe?,5,8
monica,"Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!",5,8
the doctor,"Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and—",5,8
monica,What?! What is it?,5,8
the doctor,You brought a carrot.,5,8
chandler,What?,5,8
the doctor,"This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.",5,8
rachel,You brought a carrot?!,5,8
mrs. geller,Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.,5,8
monica,"God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!",5,8
the doctor,"It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.",5,8
chandler,Without my toe?! I need my toe!,5,8
monica,"Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!",5,8
mr. geller,"Oh, I'm not falling for that one!",5,8
chandler,that is why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!,5,8
monica,I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.,5,8
chandler,that is why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!,5,8
monica,I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!,5,8
chandler,"Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.",5,8
monica,Chandler!,5,8
ross,"Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.",5,8
joey,you are a dork.,5,8
chandler,I can't believe this.,5,8
monica,"Chandler, I said I was sorry.",5,8
chandler,"Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.",5,8
monica,"Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?",5,8
chandler,"Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.",5,8
chandler,"Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, ""Quack, quack!"" I’m happy all the time!",5,8
chandler,Nice try.,5,8
monica,"Wait, wait, wait!",5,8
chandler,"Look, Monica",5,8
monica,Look!,5,8

monica,I bet this will work!,5,8
chandler,You are so great! I love you!,5,8
monica,What?,5,8
chandler,"Nothing! I said, I said ""you are so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!",5,8
monica,You said you loved me! I can't believe this!,5,8
chandler,No I didn't!,5,8
monica,"Yes, you did!",5,8
chandler,No I didn't!,5,8
monica,You love me!,5,8
chandler,No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!,5,8
french phoebe,Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here!  Whew!  This is getting ridiculous uh!,5,8

monica,"Thank you Joey, thank you so much!",5,9
joey,"Oh hey, no, you are not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me!  Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and",5,9
monica,"Wow! And around the ankles, you know that is a tough spot.",5,9
joey,"Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't",5,9
chandler,All this lying has been hard on us too.,5,9
joey,"Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!",5,9
chandler,"Well, yeah actually.",5,9
monica,"We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.",5,9
chandler,"I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.",5,9
monica,We are! Help us!,5,9
chandler,Help!,5,9
joey,"All right! But,  you do it with me once.",5,9
monica,Joey!,5,9
joey,Didn't think so.,5,9
monica,"Hey, Phoebe!",5,9
chandler,"Hi, Pheebs!",5,9

rachel,What are you reading?,5,9
phoebe,"Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.",5,9
chandler,I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.,5,9
phoebe,"Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! You know and this time I thought I'd go for something, you know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.",5,9
rachel,Honey that sounds like fun.,5,9
phoebe,"Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!",5,9

ross,Hi.,5,9
joey,What's wrong buddy?,5,9
ross,Someone at work ate my sandwich!,5,9
chandler,"Well, what did the police say?",5,9
ross,My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!,5,9
chandler,"Ross, it's just a sandwich!",5,9
ross,"Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!",5,9
monica,"Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but",5,9
ross,"That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.",5,9
chandler,"Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?",5,9
joey,I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.,5,9
phoebe,"Okay, look you want to hold onto your food? You got to scare people off. I learned that living on the street.",5,9
ross,"Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, ""Keep your mitts off my grub?""",5,9
chandler,"Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?",5,9
phoebe,"Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.",5,9
all,Whoa! OH!!,5,9
monica,"Phoebe, you are a bad ass!",5,9
phoebe,"Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.",5,9
monica,Phoebe?,5,9
phoebe,"Well, he stabbed me first!!",5,9
rachel,"Sorry I'm late, but I left late.",5,9
phoebe,Okay.,5,9
rachel,"So Pheebs, what is the book about?",5,9
phoebe,I thought you said you read it in high school.,5,9
rachel,"Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?",5,9
phoebe,"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.",5,9
the teacher,"How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?",5,9
rachel,"Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.",5,9
the teacher,"Well, that is sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?",5,9
rachel,"Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.",5,9
the teacher,Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here,5,9
phoebe,You completely stole my answer!,5,9
rachel,"Well, honey that was pretty obvious.",5,9
phoebe,Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!,5,9
the teacher,What do you think? You in the blue shirt.,5,9
phoebe,"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.",5,9
the teacher,Would you care to venture one?,5,9
phoebe,Would you care to venture one?,5,9
the teacher,Are you just repeating what I'm saying?,5,9
phoebe,Are you just repeating what I'm saying?,5,9
the teacher,"All right, let's move on.",5,9
phoebe,Okay then.,5,9
phoebe,Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!,5,9
rachel,"Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!",5,9
ross,Phoebe!,5,9
phoebe,Yeah?,5,9
ross,"Phoebe! you are note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.",5,9
monica,"Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.",5,9
ross,"That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want.  Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!",5,9
cynthia,"God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.",5,9
joey,"So you uh, still wondering?",5,9
cynthia,"No, we just went out.",5,9
joey,you are smart. I like that.,5,9
cynthia,"Oh, candles!  What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!",5,9
joey,"Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!",5,9
cynthia,I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!,5,9
joey,Hiya.,5,9
rachel,"Joey, is what she just said umm—Oh my God.  You were actually going to",5,9
chandler,What is going on here?,5,9
rachel,"And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?",5,9
joey,"I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.",5,9
joey,"You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!",5,9
monica,We're so sorry.,5,9
chandler,Yeah.,5,9
joey,"Well, I'm telling everyone about you! that is the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!",5,9
chandler,"No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.",5,9
joey,"Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?",5,9
chandler,Oh—I don't know.,5,9
joey,"Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!",5,9
monica,"Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.",5,9
joey,"All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good.  Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!",5,9
dr. leedbetter,"Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?",5,9
ross,"Yeah, of course, Donald.",5,9
dr. leedbetter,We've been getting reports of some very angry behaviour on your part.,5,9
ross,What?!,5,9
dr. leedbetter,"Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.",5,9
ross,Yeah.,5,9
dr. leedbetter,We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.,5,9
ross,"Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.",5,9
dr. leedbetter,A sandwich?,5,9
ross,"Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here",5,9
dr. leedbetter,"Oh, you know what?",5,9
ross,What?,5,9
dr. leedbetter,"I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.",5,9
ross,You ate my sandwich?,5,9
dr. leedbetter,It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.,5,9
ross,Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?,5,9
dr. leedbetter,No.,5,9
ross,Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?,5,9
dr. leedbetter,There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.,5,9
ross,That said it was my sandwich?!,5,9
dr. leedbetter,"Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.",5,9
ross,What?,5,9
dr. leedbetter,"Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.",5,9
ross,You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!,5,9
ross,MY SANDWICH?!!!,5,9
ross,MY SANDWICH!!!!!!,5,9
rachel,Hi!,5,9
phoebe,Hi!,5,9
rachel,"So umm, what's this book about?",5,9
phoebe,You didn't read this one either?!,5,9
rachel,"Well, I was going to, but I accidentally read something else.",5,9
phoebe,What?,5,9
rachel,"Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.",5,9
phoebe,No! You should've read it yourself!,5,9
rachel,Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!,5,9
phoebe,"Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.",5,9
rachel,A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!,5,9
phoebe,"Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.",5,9
the teacher,"Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?",5,9
phoebe,"Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.",5,9
the teacher,"Well, go ahead Rachel.",5,9
rachel,"Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.",5,9
the teacher,"If you are talking about feminism, I think you are right.",5,9
rachel,"Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.",5,9
chandler,Hey.,5,9
monica,"Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.",5,9
chandler,you are naked in this picture!,5,9
monica,I know.,5,9
chandler,Ross?,5,9
ross,Hey Chandler.  Monica!,5,9
monica,"Ross, are you okay?",5,9
ross,I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.,5,9
monica,Why?!,5,9
ross,On account of my rage.,5,9
chandler,"Which I may say, right now, is out of control.",5,9
ross,He gave me a pill for it.,5,9
monica,A pill?,5,9
ross,"Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.",5,9
monica,"Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?",5,9
chandler,And you are okay with that?,5,9
ross,"I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.",5,9
rachel,"Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!",5,9
phoebe,I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.,5,9
rachel,That was not funny!,5,9
phoebe,"Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.",5,9
rachel,"Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! You know, I thought it would be fun!",5,9
phoebe,"Well, yeah! Fun is good, but you know I also wanted to learn. You know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.",5,9
rachel,"OH. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, you know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. OH, you know who you should go with?",5,9
monica,I know! I know! I know!,5,9
the teacher,"Monica, you asked the question.",5,9
rachel,Oh my God! that is Monica!!,5,9
joey,Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!,5,9
rachel,"You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!",5,9
ross,What's going on?,5,9
rachel,Joey has got a secret peephole!,5,9
chandler,Oh no! No! No! No!,5,9
rachel,Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!,5,9
rachel,Look!,5,9
ross,Dude! that is my sister!,5,9
monica,Give me that!,5,9
phoebe,"All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!",5,9
joey,No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just… I just… kind of,5,9
chandler,"All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.",5,9
joey,Thank you!,5,9
chandler,Joey's a sex addict.,5,9
joey,What?!!  No I'm not!!,5,9
monica,It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!,5,9
joey,No! No! I am not a sex addict!,5,9
monica,Yes you are! that is the only way to explain all this stuff!,5,9
joey,"No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!",5,9
rachel,"Well, what is the truth?",5,9
ross,"Yeah, what's going on?",5,9
phoebe,What's going on?,5,9
joey,I slept with Monica.,5,9
chandler,Well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?,5,9
monica,Oh no!,5,9
ross,You slept with my sister?,5,9
joey,"Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.",5,9
ross,This is not good for my rage.,5,9
rachel,"Monica, is this true?",5,9
joey,Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that is been going on?,5,9
monica,Yes it's true.,5,9
rachel,"Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?",5,9
joey,Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?,5,9
monica,I guess I wanted to keep it  as a souvenir.,5,9
ross,My God Monica!!,5,9
chandler,Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you are not just a sex addict?,5,9
joey,"No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!",5,9
phoebe,So that is why she gave you a naked picture of herself.,5,9
joey,That makes sense!,5,9
rachel,And the video camera?,5,9
joey,"Uhh, Monica?",5,9
monica,I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.,5,9
joey,But sadly I could not be enticed.,5,9
ross,Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!,5,9
monica,I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.,5,9
joey,"Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.",5,9
phoebe,"I really thought you making a good point. I mean you know, until you got cut off.",5,9
a female student,"Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?",5,9
phoebe,I don't know! I didn't come with her!,5,9
monica,All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!,5,9
all,A test?!!,5,9
monica,Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!!,5,9
joey,What are you doing?,5,10
ross,"I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf",5,10
joey,Why are you doing this?,5,10
ross,"Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.",5,10
joey,"Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed?",5,10
ross,"Hey, I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical!",5,10
joey,"Hey, don’t get religious on me, ok.  A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here…sit down.  Ready?  Ahh!!  OH, yeah!! Huh?!",5,10
ross,"So what, we just sit?",5,10
joey,"OH, no, no. We’re not going to just sit.  Shh.",5,10

joey,"Come on Ross be realistic, you know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?",5,10
joey,"Wait a second, I could star in it!",5,10
ross,Or that.,5,10
joey,"I can't write! You know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, you know? I can't do it.",5,10
ross,"I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.",5,10

joey,Done!,5,10
ross,And it can't be Joey.,5,10
joey,It's not.,5,10

rachel,I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.,5,10
monica,"Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",5,10
rachel,"Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!",5,10
monica,You had no relationship!!,5,10
rachel,"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!",5,10
monica,"Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you are going to go out on a date with Danny and you are going to be so charming he's going to forget all about that stupid subway girl.",5,10
rachel,"She was kind of stupid. you are right. All right, I'm just going to go on the date. I'm going to go on the date. That is the new plan.",5,10
monica,"Come on, hurry!",5,10
joey,"Hey, how do you spell suspicious?",5,10
chandler,Why?,5,10
joey,Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.,5,10
chandler,"Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.",5,10
joey,you are driving me crazy with that!,5,10
chandler,"Okay, I'll stop.",5,10
joey,Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!,5,10
joey,"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.",5,10
chandler,You want to play?,5,10
joey,"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is going to be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm going to stick to his schedule.",5,10
chandler,"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.",5,10
joey,"All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?",5,10
chandler,I'm intrigued.,5,10
joey,"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.",5,10
chandler,"Okay, but be careful okay, because I want to get our security deposit back.",5,10
joey,"Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.",5,10
chandler,Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?,5,10
joey,"Uh yeah, right here.",5,10
phoebe,"Thank you, Happy Holidays.",5,10
phoebe,"Now, that is trash. Young lady, you can't…  Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!",5,10
phoebe,"Hey!!  The charity's on fire! Help!  Oh good! Thank you, I need that.  Whoa! What is that?!   It's nine o'clock in the morning!",5,10

chandler,"Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid—Op! Op!",5,10
ross,This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!,5,10
joey,"you are right, you are right, I'll get back to work.",5,10
ross,"And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work.  Now come on!",5,10

danny,You are so dead! I'm going to get you.,5,10
rachel,"Uh, it was very nice meeting you.",5,10
phoebe,"Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look!  Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?",5,10
monica,No.,5,10
phoebe,Does it look like an ashtray?,5,10
monica,No.,5,10
phoebe,Does it look like a urinal?,5,10
monica,Eww!!,5,10
ross,"So Pheebs, are you going to go back out there or what?",5,10
phoebe,"Well, yeah! But I'm not going to take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!",5,10
monica,"Yeah, good for you. You know you are tough, you lived on the streets.",5,10
phoebe,"Yeah, I'm going to go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, you know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.",5,10
rachel,Hey!,5,10
monica,Hey!,5,10
rachel,"Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?",5,10
monica and ross,Sure.,5,10
rachel,"Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?",5,10
ross,"Oh-oh, yeah.",5,10
monica,"All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.",5,10
ross,"Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.",5,10
monica,"Still, I was quick as a cat.",5,10
rachel,"Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.",5,10
monica,"Oh, you are kidding.",5,10
rachel,"Yeah, they were very you know…wrestley. But, I guess that is normal?",5,10
monica,"We don't, we don't wrestle now.",5,10
ross,"Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.",5,10
monica,Too strong for me?,5,10
ross,Yeah.,5,10
monica,"You want to go right now? Because I'll take you right now, buddy! You want to go?",5,10

rachel,"Okay, you know what uh, actually, that is great. That helps a lot. Thanks.",5,10
chandler,"Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!",5,10
ross,Joey's not going.,5,10
joey,I didn't finish my five pages.,5,10
chandler,"Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?",5,10
ross,Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.,5,10
joey,Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.,5,10
chandler,"Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.",5,10
ross,"I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.",5,10
joey,"Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.",5,10
chandler,"The only reason you are doing this to Joey is because you are bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you are unemployed.",5,10
ross,I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!,5,10
joey,"Come on look guys, don't fight.",5,10
ross,"And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.",5,10
chandler,"Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?",5,10
ross,If it does? Then you are an amazing friend of mine.,5,10
joey,"Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!",5,10
ross,"How about we settle this right now!  There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!",5,10
chandler,I paid for those tickets!,5,10
ross,"No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!",5,10
chandler,Oh yeah!,5,10
danny,so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!,5,10
joey,"OH, you know the same thing happened to me one time.",5,10
chandler,When did that happen to you?!,5,10
joey,Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!,5,10
chandler,"Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.",5,10
krista,"Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it.",5,10
danny,"Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.",5,10
krista,"Here, I'll get it.",5,10
krista,We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's going to set.,5,10
danny,Yep.  I'm going to wear these on our date tonight.,5,10
rachel,"Oh, great!",5,10
chandler,"Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!",5,10
monica,That was unbelievable!,5,10
rachel,"Okay, see? I told you!",5,10
joey,"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.",5,10
chandler,I don't believe they're brother and sister.,5,10
joey,They're brother and sister!!!,5,10
phoebe,"Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look.  Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that.  What's this? A Canadian coin? Get out of here!",5,10
phoebe,Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution!  And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too!  Hi Bob!   I thought I told you to get out of here!,5,10
bob,"Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're going to move you to a less high-profile spot.",5,10
phoebe,What?!,5,10
bob,"Umm, Ginger's going to take over this corner.",5,10
phoebe,That chick can't handle my corner.,5,10
bob,"Look, either you leave, or we remove you.",5,10
phoebe,"Fine.   All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.",5,10
danny,"Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?",5,10
rachel,"Yeah uh, you know what uh, let's skip it.",5,10
danny,What?! Why?!,5,10
rachel,"Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and",5,10
danny,Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?,5,10
rachel,"Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's",5,10
danny,"Do-do you, do you have brothers?",5,10
rachel,"No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.",5,10
danny,Are you close with them?,5,10
rachel,"No-no, they're not very nice people.",5,10
danny,"Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you going to let that stand in the way of us?",5,10
rachel,"Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way you know it does sort of",5,10
krista,Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!,5,10
danny,What?,5,10
rachel,"Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.",5,10
chandler,"Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you want to go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?",5,10
ross,"Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, going to Need Stitches Ball.",5,10
joey,Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!,5,10
ross,Yay!,5,10
chandler,"Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game!  Last night!",5,10
joey,"No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!",5,10
ross,"I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?",5,10
chandler,Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!,5,10
joey,"Yeah, well, that is fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but you know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?",5,10
chandler,All right.,5,10
ross,All right.,5,10
joey,"Okay.  ""It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out."" Ross",5,10

chandler,"No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.",5,10
ross,"Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest…  But we had our best friend's interest at heart.",5,10
chandler,Could I be more sorry.,5,10
ross,"I don't know, I'm one sorry palaeontologist.  All right Joey, we get it.  I'm sorry.",5,10

chandler,"I am sorry, Ross.",5,10
joey,"A handsome man enters.  Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You,  you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you  well you co-created Fireball. The end.",5,10

joey,"Okay, great!",5,11
ross,All right.,5,11
joey,Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!,5,11
phoebe,"It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?",5,11
joey,"Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm going to kiss you at midnight.",5,11
rachel,What?!,5,11
ross,"Well, everyone's got to kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.",5,11

phoebe,You too!,5,11
rachel,"Happy New Year, Joey!",5,11
joey,So did that do anything for you?,5,11
ross,You know what? I'm going to go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!,5,11
rachel,But your divorce isn't even final yet.,5,11
ross,"Just the one divorce in '99!you know what, I am going to be happy this year. I am going to make myself happy.",5,11
chandler,"Do you want us to leave the room, or?",5,11
ross,Everyday I am going to do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.,5,11
phoebe,Ooh! that is a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.,5,11
chandler,"that is good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.",5,11
phoebe,"Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.",5,11
monica,She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.,5,11
ross,"In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, you know what, better yet? A week.",5,11
chandler,"I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the ""new thing you do that day!""  And it starts right now!",5,11
joey,"All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.",5,11
ross,OH.,5,11
phoebe,Really?! How come?,5,11

phoebe,"Well, I taught me and I love me.",5,11
joey,Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!,5,11
rachel,"Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's going to be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.",5,11
monica,"Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.",5,11
rachel,I don't gossip!,5,11
rachel,"Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on you know kind of like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?",5,11
monica,"Well if Ted Kopel talked about his co-workers botched boob jobs, I would.",5,11
rachel,What? They were like this!,5,11
woman,I'll see you tomorrow.,5,11

ross,"All right, see you later.",5,11
joey,"See you! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.",5,11
phoebe,"Okay.  Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here,  then you learn here.",5,11
joey,"Umm, okay.",5,11
phoebe,"Okay, lesson one",5,11
chandler,"What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. You know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.",5,11
phoebe,"Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.",5,11

joey,"Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.",5,11
phoebe,"Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!",5,11

monica,I like them.,5,11
joey,Yeah!,5,11
monica,I like them a lot.,5,11
chandler,"that is not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area.",5,11
ross,"Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, ""Wow,  I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before.""",5,11
chandler,Oh come on!!,5,11
ross,"Okay, seriously, what do you think?",5,11
joey,You look like a freak.,5,11

joey,"Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.",5,11
ross,"My God! These pants are burning up!   Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here!  Are you hot?",5,11
elizabeth hornswoggle,No.,5,11
ross,"Okay, it must just be me then.",5,11
ross,"That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?",5,11
elizabeth,"No, go ahead.",5,11

joey,What?! I didn't touch a guitar!,5,11
phoebe,"No, but you are questioning my method!",5,11
joey,"No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid!  What?!",5,11
monica,Thank you.,5,11
phoebe,You know none of my other student thought I was stupid.,5,11
joey,"Your other student, was you!",5,11
phoebe,"Yeah, well, you know maybe you just need to try a little harder!",5,11
joey,"Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!",5,11
phoebe,"Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!",5,11
rachel,"""Baddest man in the whole damn town.""",5,11
phoebe,"Oh, fine! Take his side!",5,11
monica,I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm going to be doing laundry for a couple of hours.,5,11
chandler,Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?,5,11
monica,"Aww, you know what your nickname is, Mr. Big",5,11
rachel,Argh!!,5,11
joey,Hello?,5,11

joey,Okay.,5,11
ross,"Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom",5,11
joey,Nice!,5,11
ross,"No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!",5,11
joey,"Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?",5,11
ross,"Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!",5,11
joey,"Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.",5,11
ross,"Yeah, okay, hold on!   They're not coming on man.",5,11
joey,"Umm, do you see any—oh, Vaseline?",5,11
ross,"OH, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?",5,11
joey,"Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.",5,11
ross,Hold on.,5,11
joey,Ross? You okay?,5,11
ross,"They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!",5,11
joey,"Really?! Uhh, what colour is it?",5,11
ross,What difference does that make?!,5,11
joey,"Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!",5,11
rachel,"Joey, do you have a minute?",5,11
ross,"Dude, what am I going to",5,11
joey,"Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.",5,11
rachel,"Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!",5,11
joey,"Oh well, you are timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.",5,11
rachel,"Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!",5,11
joey,"What-what is it, what is it?",5,11
rachel,"Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.",5,11
joey,"Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!",5,11
rachel,"Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!",5,11
joey,"I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!",5,11
rachel,What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?,5,11
joey,And you are not supposed to be gossiping!!,5,11
rachel,"I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone",5,11
joey,I'm not listening to you!,5,11
elizabeth,"Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kind of freaked out.",5,11
ross,"All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.",5,11
elizabeth,"No, let's just leave the lights on.",5,11
elizabeth,Oh my God!,5,11
ross,I had a problem.,5,11
joey,"Hey, Pheebs?",5,11
phoebe,"No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!",5,11
joey,"Look, Pheebs, I just, I want to apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.  You really think I'm ready?",5,11
phoebe,Uh-huh!,5,11
joey,Wow! Cool!,5,11
joey,Was the chord at least right,5,11

phoebe,Yeah!,5,11
rachel,That really is something; that is really cool.,5,11
joey,Howdy partner!,5,11

monica,"Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm going to go do my laundry.",5,11
chandler,"Oh yeah, me too. You know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.",5,11
phoebe,"Okay, I'm going to go too. I'm going to go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.",5,11
rachel,"Good luck, honey!",5,11
phoebe,Bye!,5,11
rachel,"Hey, uh, Joey?",5,11

rachel,Remember that big thing I was going to tell you about?,5,11
joey,"Oh, no!",5,11
rachel,"I'm not going to tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?",5,11
joey,"Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!",5,11
rachel,"Yeah. Well.  Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?",5,11

ross,"Oh, thanks Gunther.  STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!",5,12
chandler,Did they teach you that in your anger management class?,5,12
phoebe,"Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?",5,12
rachel,"Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that.",5,12
phoebe,Exactly! Because it's in the past!,5,12
joey,Anybody going to eat that?,5,12

monica,What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.,5,12
rachel,"Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. You know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?",5,12
monica,"Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.",5,12

ross,"Uh actually, I think I'm going to skip it.",5,12
joey,Really?,5,12
ross,"Yeah, I'm going to stay and read my book. I just want to be alone right now.",5,12
joey,"Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.",5,12
ross,"that is okay, Joe.",5,12
joey,"All right, let's go Pheebs.",5,12
ross,Oh God!,5,12
doug,Bing!,5,12
kara,Wow!!,5,12

kara,I'm not all right.,5,12
doug,"We're, we're just going to get a little sip of water.",5,12
monica,"Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!",5,12
chandler,"Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.",5,12

doug,Nice shot.,5,12
monica,I got it!!,5,12
chandler,Long!,5,12
monica,I can't believe you let them win!,5,12
chandler,"Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.",5,12
monica,I was frustrated.,5,12
chandler,It was my racquet.,5,12
monica,I was frustrated with you!,5,12
chandler,If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.,5,12
monica,"You know what really bothers me? Is—it's how-how different you act around them! I mean you know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the ""I'll see you around, Bing!"" ""Not if I see you first, Doug!""  I got to tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.",5,12
chandler,"Okay you know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.",5,12
monica,"I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.",5,12

ross,I am going to see her again.,5,12
joey,Damnit Phoebe!!,5,12
rachel,"Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!",5,12
monica,My turn? What-what are you talking about?,5,12
rachel,"Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.",5,12
monica,What?!,5,12
rachel,"I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, ""I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."" And he said, ""Laundry? Is that my new nickname?"" And you said, ""No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big.""",5,12
monica,Well. Sounds like you are writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.,5,12
rachel,"Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.",5,12
monica,"Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big……ot.",5,12
rachel,What?!,5,12
monica,Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.,5,12
rachel,All right. So you are telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.,5,12

joey,What?!,5,12
phoebe,Are you serious?!,5,12
ross,Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that is been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours.  It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.,5,12
phoebe,"You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We",5,12
joey,And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!,5,12

monica,"Oh, none for me. Thanks.",5,12
chandler,Just a little bit of sugar.,5,12
doug,"Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That ought to sweeten it up, huh?",5,12
monica,How does that laugh not give you a headache?,5,12
chandler,"Oh, you get used to it.",5,12
monica,"You know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.",5,12
chandler,"So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?",5,12
monica,I'd rather hang out with a snivelling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.,5,12
chandler,Oh.,5,12
doug,"Uh, I got to apologize for Kara's coffee. You know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself.  Did you hear what I said Bing?",5,12
chandler,What?,5,12
doug,The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?,5,12
chandler,"Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.",5,12
doug,Excuse me?,5,12

monica,"Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.",5,12
chandler,Really?,5,12
monica,"Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?",5,12
chandler,"I think I do!  Thank you, Monica.",5,12

chandler,But we're not ready to tell yet!,5,12
monica,I know! It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. You know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.,5,12
monica,"Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!",5,12
rachel,Hey! Hi!,5,12
monica,Wh-wh-what are you doing here?,5,12

gunther,Here you go.,5,12
ross,Thanks!,5,12
janice,"Actually, I should get going.",5,12
ross,"Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?",5,12
janice,Yes! Yes! You did!,5,12
ross,Oh,5,12
janice,What is wrong now?!,5,12
ross,This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then,5,12
janice,"I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee—ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.",5,12
ross,Okay. Sometimes I feel,5,12
janice,"No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.",5,12
ross,Huh?,5,12
janice,"you are a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!",5,12
ross,"Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you are ending this with me because I'm too whiney?  So you are saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.",5,12
janice,Well yeah!!,5,12

joey,"Umm, hi.",5,12
janice,"Oh hi! Well, I guess that is two out of three, Joey.",5,12
ross,"Dude, we got to talk.",5,12
chandler,Okay.,5,12
ross,"I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice.  What you are-you are not mad?",5,12
chandler,Why would I be mad?,5,12
ross,"Well, because you know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.",5,12
chandler,"I am mad! But you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to forgive you! Because that is what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.",5,12
ross,Okay.,5,12
chandler,I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!,5,12
ross,All right.,5,12
chandler,"And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty  seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down—let's write it down!",5,12
monica,I can't believe we've never done this before! It's so good! So good for Monica!,5,13
chandler,"Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!",5,13
monica,That was a half an hour?,5,13

chandler,"All right, then massage me up right nice!",5,13
chandler,Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!,5,13
monica,"It's so good, isn't it?",5,13
chandler,It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!,5,13
monica,Say good-bye to sore muscles!,5,13
chandler,Good-bye muscles!!,5,13
chandler,"I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn't know what it was!",5,13
joey,"Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.",5,13
chandler,"Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not going to screw that up by you know, telling the truth.",5,13
ross,Hey.,5,13
joey,"Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!",5,13
ross,Sorry.,5,13
chandler,And the bunny got away.,5,13
ross,This would be the place where you explain the hat.,5,13
joey,"Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is going to be wearing this kind of you know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.",5,13
chandler,And you are going to make them all disappear.,5,13
joey,"Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.",5,13
chandler,Done.,5,13
rachel,"Joey, if you want to look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.",5,13
joey,"Great! Thanks, Rach!",5,13
rachel,"Sure!  God, please take those off!",5,13
joey,All right.,5,13
ross,"Hey Pheebs, how's it going?",5,13
chandler,Hey.,5,13
phoebe,"Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.",5,13
rachel,What?,5,13
ross,Is everything okay?,5,13
joey,Are you all right?,5,13
phoebe,"Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sort of died.",5,13
joey,Pheebs! Sorry!,5,13
phoebe,"It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never going to see her again, you know she's going to visit.",5,13
rachel,"Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?",5,13
phoebe,"Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's going to come to the coffeehouse!",5,13
monica,Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.,5,13
ross,"Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.",5,13
monica,"OH my God, I'm so sorry.",5,13
phoebe,"It's okay. Actually you know what, it's kind of cool. Because it's like you know, one life ends and another begins.",5,13
monica,"Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?",5,13
phoebe,"Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.",5,13
joey,"Pheebs, I'm so sorry.",5,13
phoebe,"It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; ""Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm going to get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter."" And you know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.",5,13
rachel,"Okay now Joey, you know that since you are returning all of this stuff right after the audition you are going to have to wear underwear?",5,13
joey,"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.",5,13
rachel,"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.",5,13
joey,Really? A purse?,5,13
rachel,It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.,5,13
joey,It looks like a women's purse.,5,13
rachel,"No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalogue. Look.  See look, men, carrying the bag.",5,13
joey,"See look, women, carrying the bag.  But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.",5,13
rachel,Exactly! Unisex!,5,13
joey,Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.,5,13
rachel,No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.,5,13
joey,"Well, I am not going to say no to that.",5,13

ursula,"Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.",5,13
phoebe,No you didn't!,5,13
ursula,"Well, then who's been dead for five years?",5,13
phoebe,"Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?",5,13
ursula,"Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kind of made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So… I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.",5,13
phoebe,"Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.",5,13
ursula,Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.,5,13

rachel,"Joey, you know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.",5,13
joey,Why would I return it? I love this bag!,5,13
rachel,"All right, then you owe me $350.",5,13
joey,Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?,5,13
rachel,Joey,5,13
joey,"All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely going to get thanks to you.",5,13

phoebe, know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!,5,13
joey,"Here, I brought you some flowers.",5,13
phoebe,Thanks!,5,13

man,"Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?",5,13
phoebe,"Yeah, welcome.",5,13
man,Hello. Hello.,5,13

phoebe,"He said, ""Nice to meet you Glenda.""  Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?",5,13
rachel,Why?! Why not?!,5,13
phoebe,"Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's going to stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!",5,13
joey,What did you say to him?,5,13
phoebe,"Well, I said, I told him you know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm going to meet him at the coffee house later.",5,13
the pastor,Could everyone please take their seats?,5,13
phoebe,"All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just want to say good-bye to my Grandma.",5,13

chandler,And a date with a man!,5,13
joey,"You know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are going to have to get used to the fact that Joey,  comes with a bag!",5,13
phoebe,"All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.",5,13
rachel,"Ooh, Pheebs, what are you going to say? Are you going to tell him who you are?",5,13
phoebe,"Umm, no, not at first Because I-I don't want to freak him out",5,13
ross,"Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I got to tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!  I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, ""Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!""  I kind of scared myself.",5,13
monica,"Well, at least you scared someone.",5,13
phoebe,"You know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd want to rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.",5,13
monica,"Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.",5,13
phoebe,All right.,5,13
phoebe,"Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!",5,13
monica,What are you talking about?,5,13

monica,I give good massages!  I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!,5,13
phoebe,He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!,5,13
monica,No he's not!,5,13
chandler,"Yes, he is!",5,13
monica,What?!,5,13
chandler,"I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!",5,13
monica,You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.,5,13
ross,"Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.",5,13
monica,But the minute we start to lie to each other…  And by 'we' I mean society.,5,13
the casting director,"Any time you are ready, Joey.",5,13
joey,"Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.",5,13

the casting director,I think we've seen enough!,5,13
joey,"Okay! All right, I'll see ya.   We got it! We got it!",5,13
chandler,"Hey, is Rachel here?",5,13
monica,No.,5,13
chandler,"Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. You know? I-I really like them.",5,13
monica,"Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me—just say, ""I don't like your massages.""",5,13
chandler,I don't like your massages.,5,13
monica,See? It's no big deal.,5,13
chandler,"Okay, but now see you are crying!",5,13
monica,I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.,5,13
chandler,What?,5,13
monica,My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.,5,13
chandler,"It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.",5,13
monica,Oh my God! You don't know me at all!,5,13
chandler,"Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.",5,13
monica,I'm crying here!!,5,13
chandler,"Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, ""Who's the best of that?"" They'd have to go to you.",5,13
monica,"Huh. So you are saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?",5,13
chandler,"Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!",5,13
monica,"So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?",5,13
chandler,Absolutely!,5,13
monica,Okay. I suck!,5,13
chandler,Yeah!,5,13
phoebe,"Umm, thank you for meeting with me.",5,13

frank sr.,"Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.",5,13
phoebe,Okay.,5,13
frank sr.,"So, what did Francis leave me?",5,13
phoebe,Huh?,5,13
frank sr.,"Well, that is why you wanted me to come, right?",5,13

frank sr.,"Yes, yes I was.",5,13
phoebe,"Okay, umm, question 2. Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?",5,13
frank sr.,It really says that?!,5,13
phoebe,Yeah. See?,5,13
frank sr.,Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.,5,13
phoebe,"Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you are just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?",5,13
frank sr.,"You know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much.  But umm… Oh, would you do me a favour? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?",5,13
phoebe,What?!,5,13
frank sr.,"Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?",5,13
phoebe,But you-you-you came to see Lilly?,5,13
frank sr.,"Yeah, yeah. Why?",5,13
phoebe,Lilly's dead.,5,13
frank sr.,She what?!,5,13

phoebe,17 years ago.,5,13

phoebe,"Yes. Well, that is neither here nor there.",5,13
frank sr.,"So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?",5,13
phoebe,"You know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not going to make a difference anyway, so you can just go.",5,13
frank sr.,"All right. Well, you know in my defence I was a lousy father.",5,13
phoebe,that is a defence?,5,13
frank sr.,"Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!",5,13
phoebe,You make up songs?,5,13
frank sr.,"Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.",5,13
frank sr.,"I just, I you know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm",5,13

chandler,"Oh, hey!",5,13
rachel,I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.,5,13
joey,I can't believe I'm hearing this!,5,13
rachel,"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag, I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.",5,13
chandler,"Yeah umm, they're called wallets.",5,13
phoebe,"Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!",5,14
rachel,I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.,5,14
ross,"Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labelled clothes.",5,14
rachel,"OH, I'm going to miss that big old squishy butt.",5,14
chandler,And we're done with the chicken fried rice.,5,14
ross,"Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!",5,14
all,Good idea! Yes!,5,14
ross,It would be so cool to live across from you guys!,5,14
joey,"Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! You know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!",5,14
chandler,Or we can do the actual telephone thing.,5,14
ross,Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!,5,14
rachel,Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.,5,14
phoebe,It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm going to beat you to it.,5,14
ross,OH.,5,14
rachel,"Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm going to go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.",5,14
phoebe,"Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler!  Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!  OH!! OH! Ahh-ah!!",5,14

ross,"Actually, it looks really good.",5,14
phoebe,Get in here!!!,5,14
phoebe,You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like you know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!,5,14
rachel,"Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.",5,14
phoebe,"Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.",5,14
joey,Hey guys!,5,14
rachel,Joey! Come here! Come here!,5,14
joey,What? What?,5,14
rachel,Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.,5,14
joey,You mean how they're friends and nothing more?,5,14
rachel,"No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window.  Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.",5,14
phoebe,"Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?",5,14
joey,"Yes, but you know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!",5,14
phoebe,"Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.",5,14
rachel,Wh-what do you mean?,5,14
phoebe,Well you know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.,5,14
rachel,"oh, I-I would enjoy that!",5,14
joey,"No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.",5,14
rachel,"Eh, no, I want to do Phoebe's thing.",5,14
joey,I can't take any,5,14
phoebe,No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!,5,14
joey,No! I can't take any more secrets!  I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own you know!,5,14
rachel,You don't have any secrets!,5,14
joey,"Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.",5,14
rachel,"So umm, how-how are we going to mess with them?",5,14
joey,Ugh.,5,14
phoebe,"Well, you could use your position you know as the roommate.",5,14
rachel,Okay.,5,14
phoebe,And then. I would use you know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.,5,14
chandler,Hello children!,5,14
all,Hey!,5,14
phoebe,"Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.",5,14

chandler,"Well, I try to you know, squeeze things.  Are you okay?",5,14
phoebe,"Well, if you really want to know, I'm—Oh! I can't tell you this.",5,14
chandler,"Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.",5,14
phoebe,Well actually you are the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.,5,14
chandler,What's going on?,5,14
phoebe,"I think it's just you know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you are looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.",5,14
monica,You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?,5,14
chandler,"Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.",5,14
monica,"Okay, now you are even cuter!!",5,14
chandler,You know that is a popular opinion today I must say.,5,14
monica,What?,5,14
chandler,"The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.",5,14
monica,What are you talking about?,5,14
chandler,I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.,5,14
monica,that is not possible!,5,14
chandler,Ow!,5,14
monica,"I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.",5,14
chandler,"OH, you know I-I can't hear that enough.",5,14
monica,"I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.",5,14
chandler,"No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!",5,14
monica,This bicep?,5,14
chandler,Well it's not flexed right now!,5,14
rachel,"Hey Mon, what are you doing now? want to come see a movie with us?",5,14
monica,"Uhh, you know actually I was going to do some laundry.",5,14
rachel,Oh.,5,14

chandler,"Sure, I'll do it with ya.",5,14
monica,Okay.,5,14
rachel,"Okay great, hold on a sec!  Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!",5,14
monica,I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.,5,14
phoebe,I have quarters!,5,14
ross,Hey!,5,14
rachel,Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?,5,14
ross,"Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.",5,14
rachel,Oh.,5,14
ross,"No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to",5,14
monica,"Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?",5,14
ross,No.,5,14
chandler,That new mountain bike?,5,14
ross,No.,5,14
monica,Well what did you send?,5,14
ross,A basket of mini-muffins.,5,14
phoebe,But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?,5,14
ross,The small one.,5,14
rachel,What?! You-you actually thought that basket was going to get you the apartment?,5,14
ross,Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.,5,14
chandler,Your work makes me sad.,5,14
ross,Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was going to work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!,5,14
rachel,"All right honey, we'd better go if we want to catch that movie.",5,14
monica,Bye!,5,14
all,Bye!,5,14
phoebe,Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.,5,14
chandler,"Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!",5,14
monica,"Actually, I did!",5,14
chandler,"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?",5,14
monica,"oh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!",5,14
chandler,Are you serious?,5,14
monica,Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! that is the only explanation for it!,5,14
chandler,Okay but what about you know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps—She knows!,5,14
chandler,Joey!,5,14
joey,Yeah?,5,14
chandler,Phoebe knows about us!,5,14
joey,Well I didn't tell them!,5,14
monica,Them?! Who's them?,5,14
joey,"Uhh, Phoebe and Joey.",5,14
monica,Joey!,5,14
joey,And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!,5,14
chandler,Oh man!,5,14
joey,"I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!",5,14
monica,Unless,5,14
joey,No! Not unless! Look this must end now!,5,14
monica,"Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So",5,14
chandler,"Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!",5,14
ross,No.,5,14
rachel,"Oh Ross, honey you got to stop torturing yourself!",5,14
phoebe,"Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?",5,14
ross,Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!,5,14
rachel,You know what you should do?,5,14
ross,Huh?,5,14
rachel,"You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.",5,14
joey,I'm listening.,5,14
rachel,See?,5,14
ross,"That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.",5,14
phoebe,He broke that.,5,14
ross,"Well, he had gravity boots.",5,14
rachel,"Yeah, he broke those too.",5,14
joey,So he likes to break stuff.,5,14
ross,"Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out.  Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?",5,14
phoebe,"I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.",5,14
joey,"Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.",5,14
ross,Right.,5,14
rachel,Hello!  Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here!  It's Chandler.,5,14
phoebe,Oh?  Hello you.,5,14
chandler,"Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.",5,14
phoebe,Eh?,5,14
chandler,"Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.",5,14
phoebe,Really?,5,14
chandler,"Yeah, listen, Joey isn't going to be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.",5,14
phoebe,"I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye!  Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!",5,14
rachel,Are you kidding?!,5,14
phoebe,No!,5,14
rachel,"I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa!  Joey, do they know that we know?",5,14
joey,No.,5,14
rachel,Joey!,5,14
joey,They know you know.,5,14
rachel,"Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!",5,14
phoebe,"God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know!  Joey, you can't say anything!",5,14
joey,I couldn't even if I wanted too.,5,14
ross,"Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but—I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you are naked and  I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.",5,14

chandler,"Okay, listen, how far am I going to have to go with her?",5,14
monica,"Relax, she-she's going to give in way before you do!",5,14

chandler,You look good.,5,14
phoebe,"Thanks! You know, that when you say things like that it makes me want to rip that sweater vest right off!",5,14
chandler,"Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?",5,14

phoebe,Yeah. I really like his glasses.,5,15
ross,"so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to throw a party. that is right. For everyone in the building, and I'm going to sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.",5,15
chandler,Sounds like a fun party.,5,15
rachel,"Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbours to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's going to cost you way more than that.",5,15
ross,It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!,5,15
rachel,"Okay, I thought it was about your neighbours liking you.",5,15
ross,"Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I got to run. I got to go get some nametags.",5,15
rachel,And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.,5,15
chandler,"Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.",5,15
rachel,"Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.",5,15
chandler,Wh-wh-why?!,5,15
rachel,"Well, because she loves you and because you love her.",5,15
chandler,"Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!",5,15
rachel,"Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and you know it's Monica.",5,15
chandler,"I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monica's, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?",5,15
rachel,"No, you are right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.",5,15
chandler,"Okay. It's not different at all, is it?",5,15
rachel,Not unless different means the same.,5,15
katie,You were so funny with that waiter! you are such a nut!,5,15
joey,"You know, breadstick fangs are always funny.",5,15
katie,"No, you make them funny. you are the funny one!",5,15
joey,"Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.",5,15
katie,"Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!",5,15
monica,Isn't this great?,5,15
chandler,Hmm.,5,15
monica,Couldn't you just stay like this forever?  Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?,5,15
chandler,"Yeah, here, somewhere else, you know where-where ever.",5,15
monica,Are you okay?,5,15
chandler,"Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.",5,15
monica,What-what are you doing?,5,15
chandler,"I'm just hanging out. You know, having fun. You know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.",5,15
monica,"Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!",5,15
chandler,What?!,5,15
monica,Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.,5,15
chandler,"Well, you do want all that stuff, right?",5,15
monica,Oh and you know what I want!,5,15
chandler,Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!,5,15
monica,I do not have baby fever!,5,15
chandler,"Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that is related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!",5,15
monica,"Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!",5,15
chandler,Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!,5,15
monica,You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!,5,15
chandler,"Well, I did not know that.",5,15
chandler,"It's going to be okay, right? I mean she's not going to leave me? This is, this is fixable.",5,15
ross and joey,"Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.",5,15
chandler,By me?,5,15
ross,"Oh, no!",5,15
joey,No-no.,5,15
ross,"Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.",5,15
joey,"Yeah, big!",5,15
joey,"Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.",5,15
monica,"Gunther, can I get a coffee  to go?",5,15
chandler,Monica.,5,15
monica,I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.,5,15
chandler,Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.,5,15
monica,What?!,5,15
chandler,"Well, that is what we do. You know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then you know you think I'm all cute again.",5,15
monica,"Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. you are going to have to figure this one for yourself. All right? You know what? If you are too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.",5,15

phoebe,"Yeah, but they didn't ask me! You know? This way I'm just you know, the exotic, generous stranger. that is always fun to be.",5,15

rachel,"Uhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.",5,15
joey,"Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. You know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's going to hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?",5,15

phoebe,"No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?",5,15
ross,"So uh, what did you tell them about me?",5,15
phoebe,"Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. You know, try to get some sympathy.",5,15
ross,OH.,5,15
phoebe,But somehow you came off as the bad guy.,5,15
ross,What?!,5,15
phoebe,"Yeah, I think I told it wrong. You know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.",5,15
ross,"OH, this cake is really good!",5,15
phoebe,"Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!",5,15

steve,3-B!,5,15

all,"Yeah, get out! Now!",5,15
steve,"Go back to 3-B, 3-B!",5,15
phoebe,"All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross?  Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, ""Who hear likes Ross,"" and he's wearing two nametags!  I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you you know Kurt, I thought, you know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys   Gold-digger,  cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.",5,15
phoebe,"Obviously I didn't think they were going to start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.",5,15
ross,"Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.",5,15
chandler,Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?,5,15
monica,I'm Monica.,5,15
chandler,"I need to talk to you, it's urgent!",5,15
monica,Okay.,5,15
chandler,"Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, you know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.",5,15
monica,Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!,5,15
chandler,Monica,5,15
monica,"No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!",5,15
chandler,Will you marry me?,5,15
ross,Oh-no. No. No.,5,15
joey,What a bad idea!,5,15
rachel,"oh, I cannot look at it!",5,15
monica,"Chandler, why are you doing this?",5,15
chandler,I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.,5,15
monica,Chandler.,5,15
chandler,I'm doing this because I'm sorry?,5,15
monica,"Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you are sorry?",5,15
chandler,"No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth you know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  Will you be my wife?",5,15
monica,"Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.",5,15
chandler,"Yeah, I'm kind of wishing everyone wasn't here right now.",5,15
monica,Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!,5,15
chandler,"Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.",5,15
monica,Who? Two divorces and Joey?!,5,15
ross,Hey!,5,15
joey,She's right you know.,5,15
ross,"Yeah, but still, cheap shot!",5,15
monica,"You know what? You know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you are not ready for that.",5,15
chandler,I didn't think I was!,5,15
monica,"Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?",5,15
chandler,"Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.",5,15
joey,"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?",5,15
ross,"No, I will not!",5,15
joey,"Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.",5,15
ross,"you are right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?",5,15
phoebe,"Aw, and I was going to ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.",5,15
rachel,"Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?",5,15
chandler,"Okay, how long is this going to go on.",5,15
monica,"Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.",5,15
ross,"This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole ""We were on a break thing?"" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?",5,15
chandler,that is not funny.,5,15
joey,that is not funny at all!,5,15
joey,Hey!,5,16
chandler,Hey!,5,16
monica,Hey!,5,16
joey,What are you guys doing up?,5,16
chandler,"Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?",5,16
joey,Dark red.,5,16
chandler,"Yeah, I think that is wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later.  Hey, how about maroon?",5,16
monica,"Yes, you are so smart!",5,16
joey,"Aww, you guys are so cute!",5,16
monica,I know.,5,16
joey,"All right, I'll see you in the morning.",5,16
chandler and monica,Okay.,5,16
dream monica,"You know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!",5,16
dream joey,"Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.",5,16

rachel,A couple of bucks.,5,16
phoebe,"Okay, dime!  You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while.  Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa!  Oh my God, this is a police badge!",5,16
monica,Wow!,5,16
chandler,"Oh that is so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. you know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.",5,16
rachel,"Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.",5,16
phoebe,"Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!",5,16
joey,"Hey, you guys!",5,16
chandler,Hey!,5,16
rachel,Hey Joey!,5,16

joey,"Well uh, it's just that uh, you know if-if you are going to be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him.",5,16
monica,"I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.",5,16
joey,No-no! No! I mean it's going to be all smelling like Monica!,5,16
monica,Are you saying I smell bad?,5,16
joey,"No! No, you smell like a meadow.  I'm sorry.",5,16
monica,What's with him?,5,16
chandler,"OH, you know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.",5,16
rachel,Ugh!,5,16
ross,"Yeah, I still don't know.  I'm sorry I just want to make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, ""Kids welcome here."" But that also says,  ""Come here to me!""",5,16
rachel,What?! You say that to kids?!!,5,16
ross,"No! No! No! The ""Come here to me"" is you know for the ladies.",5,16
rachel,"Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.",5,16
the salesman,You picked a great couch.,5,16
ross,Yeah?,5,16
the salesman,Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?,5,16
ross,"Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!",5,16

ross,"Yeah, you know what? I'll take it myself, thank you!  All right Rach, let's go!",5,16
rachel,Yeah!   Are you kidding'?,5,16
ross,"Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!",5,16
rachel,Oh. Oh! I can do it!,5,16
ross,Yeah!,5,16
the salesman,You two are really going to enjoy that couch.,5,16
ross,"Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.",5,16
the salesman,"OH, okay.  Something didn't quite add up there.",5,16
rachel,Ross!,5,16
ross,What's that supposed to mean?,5,16
rachel,Ross!,5,16
the salesman,"Well you, her, I mean, she's very…You know. And you are like…You know.",5,16
ross,"Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.",5,16
the salesman,Really? You two?,5,16
ross,Yeah! Rach?,5,16
rachel,"Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.",5,16
ross,Then tell him quickly.,5,16

phoebe,Yeah that is right you are so busted.  Book them.,5,16
the smoking woman,Who are you talking too?,5,16
phoebe,"Save it Red! Unless you want to spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.",5,16
the smoking woman,I am not going to apologize to a tree!,5,16
phoebe,You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!!,5,16
the smoking woman,I-I'm sorry! Sorry.,5,16
phoebe,"Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!",5,16

monica,"Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!",5,16
phoebe,I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.,5,16
chandler,"Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.",5,16
phoebe,"You could get arrested, right now!  All right, yeah, I got to take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.",5,16
phoebe,Hey.,5,16
joey,Hey!  Oh.,5,16

monica,"Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.",5,16
joey,What?! Why?!,5,16
monica,What is going on with you?,5,16
joey,Nothing!,5,16
chandler,"Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!",5,16
joey,"All right! There is something. I kind of had a dream,  but I don't want to talk about it.",5,16
chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kind of have a dream! I don’t want to talk about it.,5,16
joey,"Well, it involved Monica.",5,16
chandler,"You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!  I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.   Anyway we're talking about your dream.  I love you.  Your dream?",5,16
joey,"Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.",5,16
monica,What was the dream about?,5,16
joey,"Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. You know like you guys were doing last night. So, that is it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.",5,16
monica,"Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you are in love with me!",5,16
joey,It-it doesn’t?,5,16
monica,No!,5,16
chandler,"No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you are jealous because I've become the apartment stud.",5,16
joey,That kind of sounds like your dream dude.,5,16
monica,"Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we you know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.",5,16
joey,In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.,5,16
monica,Um-hmm.,5,16
chandler,"Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?",5,16
joey,Not really.,5,16
chandler,Well there you have it!,5,16
monica,"Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats!  But that is good that you are not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!",5,16
joey,"No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. You know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but you know are we ever going to have you know the closeness like-like you guys have?",5,16
chandler,"Well you know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that is it?",5,16
joey,Friends first? that is interesting.,5,16
monica,You become friends after?,5,16
joey,"No, never done that either.",5,16
rachel,"Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?",5,16

phoebe,"Don’t try to call him or anything, Because he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.",5,16
cop,"Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.",5,16
phoebe,"I-I sure will, take care.",5,16
cop,"Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is going to be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good.  And where did you find my badge?",5,16
phoebe,Oh.,5,16
rachel,"Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?",5,16
joey,"Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But you know what? I guess I can blow that off,  for you.",5,16
rachel,Thanks!,5,16
joey,"Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.",5,16
rachel,I know.,5,16
joey,Yeah that is not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.,5,16
rachel,What's up Joe?,5,16
joey,"Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great",5,16
rachel,Yeah?,5,16
joey,"is because they were friends first. You know? So I asked myself, ""Who are my friends?"" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So",5,16
rachel,What are you saying?,5,16
joey,I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.,5,16
rachel,"You know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.",5,16
joey,I'll treat you real nice.,5,16
rachel,"Yeah, well, you know umm… No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is you know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!",5,16
joey,Won't-won't that take longer?,5,16
rachel,"Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, oh it's so worth the wait.",5,16
joey,"Yeah. I understand. I understand.  Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!",5,16
ross,"Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.",5,16
rachel,Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.,5,16
ross,"Oh great! What, you brought Joey?",5,16
rachel,"Well, I brought the next best thing.",5,16
chandler,Hey!,5,16
ross,Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!,5,16
chandler,"You know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so",5,16
ross,"Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're going to do it.  Okay Rach,  that is you. that is the couch.",5,16
rachel,"Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?",5,16
ross,"Oh, that is me.",5,16
rachel,Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.,5,16
ross,No! that is-that is my arm!,5,16
chandler,"Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.",5,16
ross,You know what? Just-just follow my lead.,5,16
rachel,Okay!,5,16
chandler,Okay.,5,16
ross,"Come on, Chandler.",5,16
ross,"All right.  Okay, here we go!",5,16
ross,"All right, ready?",5,16
chandler,Yeah.,5,16
ross,Turn.,5,16
chandler,Okay.,5,16
ross,Turn! Turn!,5,16
chandler,"Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!",5,16
rachel,"Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.",5,16
ross,"Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot!  Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!",5,16
chandler,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!,5,16
ross,"Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.",5,16
chandler and rachel,You think?!,5,16
ross,"All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.",5,16
chandler,"Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.",5,16
ross,I can't believe that didn't work!,5,16
rachel,"I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!",5,16
chandler,"OH, you know, what did you mean when you said pivot?",5,16
joey,Hey!,5,16
rachel,Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?,5,16
joey,"Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.",5,16
chandler,"Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?",5,16
joey,"Uhh, well, she's…really good in bed.",5,16
monica,"Joey, I thought you were going to try to be friends first!",5,16
joey,"Well look, hey, it's all your fault!",5,16
rachel,What?! Why?!,5,16
joey,"Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to you know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!  And her roommate!",5,16
monica,What about the closeness?,5,16
joey,Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!,5,16
joey,"All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!",5,16
chandler,"Ooh, I do! I do! I do!",5,16

phoebe,"Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!",5,16
rachel,"Oh my God, Phoebe, are you going to go to jail?!",5,16
phoebe,"Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you  with me.  Harbouring a fugitive? that is one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler.  Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!",5,16
cop,"Yeah, but I kind of don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?",5,16
phoebe,Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!,5,16
cop,"I don't like looking foolish. You know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.",5,16
phoebe,I would love it if I weren't here!,5,16
cop,"Okay, so since umm, you are not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?",5,16
phoebe,Me?!,5,16
cop,"Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kind of can't stop thinking about you. you are the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.",5,16

phoebe,"All right, I can't wait!",5,16
gary,"Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just going to take you out for donuts.",5,16
chandler,He has a gun!,5,16

the saleswoman,You want to return this couch?  It's cut in half!,5,16
ross,that is what I'm telling you.,5,16

rachel,No!,5,17
chandler,So what happened?,5,17
rachel,"Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, you know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, ""Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!""  Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!",5,17

monica,A kiss? What are you talking about?,5,17

chandler,"Come on, Rach.",5,17
rachel,Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?,5,17
monica,He probably wants you back because you are right for the job.,5,17
rachel,"Maybe. I-I don't know—Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!",5,17
joey,"Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on.  She's back! Hot girl's back!",5,17

monica,"Oh, we're not seeing a movie!",5,17

chandler,"Uh, yeah.",5,17
monica,Okay.  We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.},5,17

chandler,That was amazing!,5,17
monica,Phoebe and Gary are so going to hear about this at dinner.,5,17
chandler,That was amazing.,5,17
monica,We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! you are the best.,5,17

monica,Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?,5,17
joey,"I don't know. But I can see through your sheet.  Yeah, yeah, that is her. But you know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never going to get to meet her anyway.",5,17
monica,Why?,5,17
joey,"Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.",5,17
monica,"What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!",5,17
joey,"No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.",5,17
monica,"No, those first two windows,  that is the lobby. And you know the other one over there, that is the stairway. You've been counting wrong.",5,17
joey,I did not know that! Thank you Monica.  I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.,5,17
ross,"So uhh, you ready?",5,17
jen,"Sure, I'll just get my coat.  Could you get that?",5,17
ross,Sure.  Joey,5,17
joey,Dahhhhh!!  No! No!!,5,17
rachel,"Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.",5,17
mr. zelner,"that is quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.",5,17
rachel,"Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.",5,17
mr. zelner,Fair enough.,5,17
rachel,"Now you are probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah,  who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that is a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage.  Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but you know you got to have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didn't want to sue him.   Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got  courage, you got integrity, you got  courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr",5,17
mr. zelner,Zelner.,5,17
rachel,"Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.",5,17
mr. zelner,"You know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.",5,17
rachel,Oh! You are?,5,17
mr. zelner,Um-hmm.,5,17
rachel,"Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?",5,17
mr. zelner,Yes!,5,17
rachel,"Okay, well then how about a handshake?  Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that—I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so—Hey! I'll see you Monday!",5,17
phoebe,You tired Chandler?,5,17
monica,"You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?",5,17
chandler,"Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.",5,17
gary,"So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?",5,17
chandler,"Oh yeah, it's so cool.  Now I got to go, Officer Bing has got to, 10-100.  that is pee-pee.",5,17
monica,"Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.",5,17
phoebe,"OH,  umm, we kind of took a little detour on the way over here.",5,17
gary,"Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so",5,17
monica,You didn't!,5,17
phoebe,We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!,5,17
monica,The park huh? A public place.,5,17
gary,Uh-huh.,5,17
monica,I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!,5,17
monica,Hi Chandler.,5,17
chandler,Monica! This is the Men's room!  Isn't it?,5,17
monica,Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?,5,17
chandler,"No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!",5,17
monica,"Come on, we can't let them win!",5,17
chandler,"Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!",5,17
monica,Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!,5,17
chandler,So?,5,17
monica,I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.,5,17
chandler,Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?,5,17
monica,Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were you know all over each other all the time?,5,17
chandler,"Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.",5,17
monica,Really?,5,17
chandler,"Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that is lasted this long before. You know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that is pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that is pretty exciting.",5,17
monica,"That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.",5,17
chandler,Yeah?,5,17
monica,Yeah.,5,17
chandler,You know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.,5,17
monica,Did not.,5,17
chandler,Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!,5,17
monica,"Okay, I freaked out a little.",5,17
chandler,"Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!   And now we're back.",5,17
rachel,I cannot believe Ross is buying this!,5,17
monica,Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!,5,17
chandler,You guys ready fore the movies?,5,17

ben,Hi!!,5,18
carol,Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!,5,18
phoebe,What are you talking about?!,5,18
ross,"Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--You know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.",5,18
joey,"Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!  Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!  I mean, way to go Ben!  Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.",5,18
ross,"I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings",5,18
joey,I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!,5,18
chandler,That.,5,18
rachel,"Okay, got to go! Wish me luck!",5,18
joey,Luck!,5,18
chandler,"Hey Rach, now that you are working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?",5,18
rachel,"Uh well, you know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day",5,18
chandler,"Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.",5,18
monica,"Besides, if anybody's going to get free stuff, it's going to be me.",5,18
rachel,"Okay guys, way to wish me luck!",5,18
all,Good luck! Go get them!,5,18
phoebe,"Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.",5,18
joey,"Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.",5,18
phoebe,"Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.",5,18
monica,"I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.",5,18
joey,Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!,5,18
ross,Okay!!,5,18
joey,Done.,5,18
phoebe,"Okay, great so do you want to do it together?",5,18
monica,I would love to do it together!,5,18
joey,They're going to do it together.,5,18
chandler,Dude! that is my girlfriend!,5,18
joey,"What, so I got to shut it down now?",5,18
ross,"All right, I got to take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.",5,18
monica,It's going to be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.,5,18
ross,Yeah.,5,18
chandler,Weirder than watching his two moms make out?,5,18
joey,Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?,5,18
ross,Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.,5,18
joey,"Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.",5,18
ross,you are not his godfather.,5,18
joey,What?! Are you kidding?!,5,18
ross,"Of course I am!  Okay, let's go godfather.",5,18
joey,All right!,5,18
joey,"Hey! I'm in, they're going to let me audition!",5,18
ross,Really? that is great!,5,18
joey,"I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her",5,18
carol,"Hey, that kid looks familiar.",5,18
joey,"Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, PlayStation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad….",5,18
ross,"Yeah well, he's not going to get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,",5,18
joey,"that is great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?",5,18
ross,"Joey, you look nothing like Ben.",5,18
joey,I look more like him than you do!,5,18
carol,"You know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.",5,18
kim,"So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?",5,18
rachel,"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.",5,18
kim,"Oh don't be sorry, that is part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.",5,18
nancy,"She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!",5,18
rachel,"Oh, what a fun office.",5,18
kim,"I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?",5,18
kim,Rachel? Do you smoke?,5,18
rachel,"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",5,18
rachel,and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!,5,18
monica,That doesn't seem fair.,5,18
rachel,"I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!",5,18
chandler,"Yeah, it is the best.",5,18
rachel,"I mean what if this keeps happening? You know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, you know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's going to pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?",5,18
monica,"Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you want to get some fresh air.",5,18
rachel,"Yeah, I can do that.",5,18
chandler,"Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.",5,18
phoebe,Hey!,5,18
monica,Hey!,5,18
phoebe,"Hey Rach, you want to get some coffee?",5,18
rachel,I would love to!,5,18
phoebe,Oh good!,5,18
chandler,"Yeah, I want to go to babe.",5,18
phoebe,Oh good.,5,18
phoebe,"Oh wait, I change my mind!  Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!",5,18
monica,"Yeah, me too!",5,18
phoebe,"Oh, look at that.",5,18
monica,"All right, that is a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm you know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.",5,18
phoebe,What happened to the intimate dinner party?,5,18
monica,"Oh, we're not doing that. Okay",5,18
phoebe,"So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.",5,18
monica,"What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!",5,18
phoebe,Like what?,5,18
monica,Cups.,5,18
phoebe,Cups? you are giving me cups?,5,18
monica,And ice!,5,18
phoebe,"Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice?  All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!",5,18
monica,"Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant",5,18
phoebe,I got it! Mine!,5,18
ross,Hi.,5,18
monica,Hey! How'd the audition go?!,5,18
ross,Not so good.,5,18
monica,"Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's  ""Audition didn't go so well.  Yeah it did?""",5,18
ross,"Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!",5,18
joey,"Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a call-back.",5,18
monica,You got a call-back too didn't you?,5,18
joey,Yeah I did!,5,18
kim,"Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?",5,18
rachel,"Oh well, it's kind of lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.",5,18
kim,Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.,5,18
rachel,Oh great!,5,18
kim,"So anyway we really…  Honey, we're just smoking all over you.",5,18
nancy,"Oh, sorry!",5,18
rachel,Oh that is okay.,5,18
kim,"No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.",5,18
nancy,So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.,5,18
kim,Oh that is great! You are the best!,5,18
rachel,"Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? you know what, actually…  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?",5,18
nancy,I thought you didn't smoke.,5,18
rachel,"Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, you know? You know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, ""Wow, those guys are crazy!"" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.",5,18
kim,We get high.,5,18
rachel,"Oh, me too.",5,18
kim,I'm kidding.,5,18
rachel,"Oh, me too.",5,18
ross,"Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?",5,18
joey,"Well, unfortunately, I don't get many call-backs so",5,18
carol,Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?,5,18
joey,Who knows?,5,18
the casting director,"Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.",5,18
ross,Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!,5,18
joey,Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!,5,18
ross,Yeah!,5,18
the casting director,"Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two  or you two.",5,18
joey,"Man, this is going to be kind of weird.",5,18
ross,"Yeah, it is.",5,18
kyle,Yeah. It's going to be weird.,5,18
ross,"No, we-we're going to be like best friends, that is why it's going to be weird.",5,18
kyle,"Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.",5,18
phoebe,Hey!,5,18
ross and chandler,Hi!,5,18
phoebe,Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?,5,18
chandler,Ah sure. What's in them?,5,18
phoebe,"Umm, cups.",5,18
chandler,"Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.",5,18
ross,Seriously that is a lot of cups.,5,18
phoebe,"Yeah well, that is Because Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is going to rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.",5,18
chandler,You know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.,5,18
phoebe,"Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!",5,18
joey,Hey Pheebs!  Hey!,5,18
ross,Hey!,5,18
joey,"Ross good, I'm uh glad you are here. I want to talk to you about something.",5,18
ross,What's up?,5,18
joey,"Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, you know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just going to step aside. I'm going to tell them that I won't audition.",5,18
ross,"Wow, uh, Joey that is-that is great. Thanks man.",5,18
joey,that is it? you are-you are going to let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!,5,18
ross,"Well, you just",5,18
joey,"I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!",5,18
ross,What?!,5,18
joey,What? Chandler! Tell them!,5,18
chandler,"Well I mean, let me get the door first.  Oh, hi! No one.",5,18
ross,"Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! you are like the uh, tag-a-long dad.",5,18
joey,At least I care about his feelings!,5,18
ross,What?!,5,18
joey,Do you know how hard this is going to be on him when he doesn’t get it?,5,18
ross,And why wouldn't he get it?,5,18
joey,"Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!",5,18
ross,Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?,5,18
joey,You just give him a spoon baby!,5,18
ross,Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!,5,18
joey,Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!,5,18
ross,you are kid's name is Raymond!,5,18

monica,You stink!,5,18
rachel,Thanks!,5,18
monica,"No, I'm-I'm serious!",5,18
rachel,Well-well that is Because I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.,5,18
chandler,"Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!",5,18
rachel,I did not!,5,18
chandler,Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!,5,18
rachel,"All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!",5,18
chandler,I wish I had smoked for my career,5,18
monica,that is so gross!,5,18
rachel,"No well, no it's not that bad, you know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.",5,18
chandler,"Okay, but you got to push past this because it is about to get so good!",5,18
monica,"Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.",5,18
chandler,I think you smell great!,5,18
kim,"So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?",5,18
nancy,Absolutely!,5,18
rachel,I am so on board!,5,18
kim,Rachel didn't you just light that?,5,18
rachel,"Yeah, I did, but you know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, you know?  Good luck, Rach.",5,18
nancy,I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.,5,18

nancy,"Oh, I never could do it.",5,18
rachel,Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!,5,18
kim,"OH you know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!",5,18

joey,"Oh yeah, no problem.",5,18
carol,Thanks.,5,18
joey,"Hi Ben! So you want to be an actor huh? I got to tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you are Dr. Drake Ramoray, the next day you are eating ketchup right out of the bottle.",5,18

ross,"Ben!   I mean, Ben! Ben!",5,18

phoebe,"Check it out! Cup hat!  Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!",5,18
chandler,"Great job with the cups, Pheebs!",5,18
monica,Why don't you just go out with her!,5,18
phoebe,And did you notice the ice?  Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch!  Ah! Mystical!,5,18

joey,Yeah right!,5,18
ross,"No really, I-I am! I feel bad!",5,18
joey,"Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, ""Hmm, noodle soup.""",5,18
ross,"Yeah you know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.",5,18
joey,What you do mean?,5,18
ross,"I think, sub-consciously",5,18
joey,"Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.",5,18
ross,"I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.",5,18
joey,"Well, you are way sounds a lot better than mine.  Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor",5,18
ross,No!,5,18
joey,"No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.",5,18
ross,There you go. Thank you!,5,18
joey,"Thank you! So, did-did he get it?",5,18
ross,No.,5,18
joey,"Eh, what are you going to do?",5,18

chandler,"Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11",5,19
delivery girl,Hi Chandler!,5,19
chandler,Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.,5,19
caitlin,"Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.",5,19
chandler,"Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.",5,19
caitlin,"It's uh, 27 dollars even.",5,19
chandler,"Oh, okay.  Here you go.",5,19
caitlin,"Hey, where's the chicken?",5,19
chandler,"Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.",5,19
caitlin,Great. I'll see you later!,5,19

chandler,What?,5,19
ross,"The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!",5,19
chandler,I was not flirting.,5,19
ross,"It was totally flirting. ""Somebody got a haircut """,5,19
chandler,"Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.",5,19
ross,"Yeah, right.",5,19
chandler,You want to see flirting? I'll show you flirting.,5,19
ross,I'm good.,5,19
rachel,"I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!",5,19
phoebe,I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?,5,19
rachel,No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.,5,19
phoebe,Don't get me started on that.,5,19
chandler,I was not flirting.,5,19
ross,"And on your anniversary, for shame!",5,19
rachel,What's going on?,5,19
ross,Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!,5,19
chandler,"I was not and oh God, shh!",5,19
ross,"Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.",5,19
phoebe,Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.,5,19
ross,Well,5,19
chandler,Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?,5,19
rachel,Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.,5,19
ross,"Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.",5,19

phoebe,"Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!",5,19
rachel,Tell her to wear her own earrings.,5,19
phoebe,These are her earrings.,5,19
rachel,No! No! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!,5,19
phoebe,Why not?,5,19
rachel,Because I lose her stuff!,5,19
joey,"Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm going to bash his head in later.",5,19
joey,"Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.",5,19
chandler,"If you said, ""Big lima bean, bubbling up."" Would she understand the difference?",5,19
monica,Rach? What are you doing?,5,19

monica,"It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.",5,19

chandler,Really?!,5,19

monica,Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!,5,19
chandler,"Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.",5,19
joey,True story!,5,19
monica,"Chandler, this actually bothers you?",5,19
chandler,"Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?",5,19
rachel,"Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.",5,19
ross,"And thank you, for that.",5,19
rachel,"But you know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.",5,19
ross,"What?  What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.",5,19
rachel,"OH! You know what? you are right! We meet, you flirted and then bam nine years later you had me!",5,19
ross,"All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number!  And not the one on the menu!",5,19

joey,"Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here!  Oh my God.",5,19
monica,What?,5,19
joey,"Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.",5,19
chandler,"Well, what is it?",5,19
joey,"Oh, they cut me out of the show.",5,19
rachel,What?!,5,19
ross,Are you sure?,5,19
phoebe,Maybe your scene's coming up?,5,19
joey,Not likely. Because you see that body bag right there,5,19
rachel,Yeah.,5,19
joey,I'm in it.,5,19
phoebe,"This is terrible, what are you going to do?",5,19
joey,"I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.",5,19
phoebe,that is not good.,5,19
joey,"No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!",5,19
rachel,"Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.",5,19
chandler,"If we keep talking this way, aren't we going to freak her out soon?",5,19
grandma tribbiani,,5,19
joey,"Soon, soon, I'm going to be on soon. There I am!",5,19
grandma tribbiani,No! Sam Waterston!,5,19
joey,"No-no-no, that-that is me, that is me.",5,19
grandma tribbiani,"No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.",5,19
chandler,"Doesn't know, ""Hello."" But she knows Capricorn One.",5,19
monica,"Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.",5,19
phoebe,But I already gave them back to you!,5,19
monica,No you didn't.,5,19
phoebe,"All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that is what I said.  Where is that other earring?",5,19
rachel,"It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. OH, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!",5,19
phoebe,Make sure you check Chandler's jewellery box.,5,19
rachel,Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewellery box?,5,19
phoebe,"Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!",5,19
ross,"Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?",5,19
phoebe,Why are you being weird?,5,19
ross,Do you like it?,5,19
phoebe,"No, that would be, ""Why are you being cute?""",5,19
ross,"Okay, I'm working on my flirting.",5,19
phoebe,OH! I did not get that.,5,19
chandler,"So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?",5,19
monica,"Yeah, it's good.",5,19
chandler,"See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!",5,19
monica,"Chandler!  Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.",5,19
chandler,"Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.",5,19
monica,"Go on, teach me something about men and women.",5,19
chandler,"Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, ""I'm just flirting, no big deal."" But the guy is thinking, ""Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!""",5,19
monica,No way!,5,19
chandler,It's true.,5,19
monica,Well that is pathetic!,5,19
chandler,Again true.,5,19
monica,And this goes for all guys?,5,19
chandler,All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.,5,19
joey,"All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!",5,19
ross,Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like  ten minutes left!,5,19
joey,"I know, I know! What am I going to do?  Ooh!",5,19
monica,No! You are not going to run out and leave her here!,5,19
joey,"Yeah, all right.  Ooh!",5,19
grandma tribbiani,Joey!,5,19
chandler,"Uh, Joey is going to be right back. Right back!  Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you.  So, you are old and small.",5,19
rachel,Hey!,5,19

phoebe,"All right well, we're just going to have to tell Monica, that is all.",5,19
rachel,"Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.",5,19
phoebe,I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.,5,19
rachel,OH that'd be great!,5,19
phoebe,"Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?",5,19
monica,"Yeah, what is it?",5,19
phoebe,"Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!",5,19
monica,"Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.",5,19
phoebe,"I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.",5,19

phoebe,Yeah! you are the best!,5,19
rachel,"Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.",5,19
monica,"That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!!  Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewellery! And if it's not my jewellery, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!",5,19

ross,"Sorry! Sorry! Oh,  there!  Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!",5,20
chandler,Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.,5,20
joey,"Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?",5,20
emily,"Are you thinking about me? Of course you are not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.",5,20
monica,No!,5,20
rachel,I know!,5,20
monica,"Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!",5,20
rachel,What?! We can't do that!,5,20
monica,"We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?",5,20
rachel,No! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!,5,20
monica,"I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?",5,20
rachel,I don't think he's the one who needs help.,5,20
monica,"No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.   Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he going to do? Ross is going to run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?!  Okay, fine, all right, but that is you know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.",5,20
rachel,Ugh!,5,20
monica,"You know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.",5,20
rachel,"Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!",5,20
answering machine,Your messages have been erased.,5,20
rachel,No!,5,20
chandler,"Okay, you know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!",5,20
gary,"No. But that reminds me,  sign this.",5,20
ross,What is it?,5,20
gary,"Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or you know, get your head blown off.",5,20
chandler,"Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.",5,20
gary,"Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!",5,20
ross,What? What? What? What is it?,5,20
joey,Is everything okay?,5,20
chandler,What's going on?,5,20
gary,"Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.",5,20
gary,"Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.  Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?",5,20
joey,You okay man?,5,20
ross,Uh-huh. Thank Joey!,5,20
chandler,"Uh, HELLO!!",5,20
joey,Hi.,5,20
monica,"All right, I guess we should go.",5,20
rachel,"No, wait. Wait.",5,20
monica,Oh yeah right!,5,20
rachel,"No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!",5,20
monica,There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!,5,20
rachel,Yeah well unless we tell him.,5,20
monica,"Well, if you are going to be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you want to tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.",5,20
rachel,"Oh, maybe that is Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.",5,20
ross,"Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!",5,20
monica,Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!,5,20
rachel,Right?,5,20
gary,"Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?",5,20
phoebe,John Glenn is here?!,5,20
gary,"No, Joey!",5,20
ross,"Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car",5,20
gary,Wait! Hold on!   Hi!,5,20
phoebe,Hi!,5,20
gary,"Okay, go ahead.",5,20
ross,"Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!",5,20
phoebe,"My God, Joey!",5,20
chandler,It was a car backfire!,5,20
ross,"Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!",5,20
joey,"Yeah, I didn't know that.",5,20
ross,And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.,5,20
gary,"Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.",5,20
chandler,Who jumps at loud noises!,5,20
ross,Wow! I could've died tonight.,5,20
chandler,"Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! You know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.",5,20
ross,I do have a newfound respect for life.,5,20
chandler,Oh my God!,5,20
gary,So you want to get some dinner?,5,20
phoebe,"Yeah! Sure! Yep!  OH, you know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.",5,20
gary,Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighbourhood.,5,20
phoebe,Okay!,5,20
gary,All right.,5,20
phoebe,Bye!,5,20
ross and joey,Bye!,5,20
joey,Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,5,20
joey,Dude! How come you took off?,5,20
chandler,"Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever",5,20
joey,Is something wrong?,5,20
chandler,"No. No I'm just tired. You know, from-from the walk.",5,20
joey,Okay.,5,20
chandler,You dove in front of Ross! Ross!,5,20
joey,"that is what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!",5,20
chandler,I do not hate Ross!,5,20
joey,Of course you do! I saved him! you are mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.,5,20
chandler,What picture?,5,20
joey,"I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!",5,20
chandler,"Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but you know, it could've been a bullet and you you know, you didn't try to save me!",5,20
joey,"OH, you are upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I…knew…you could take care of yourself. You know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!",5,20
chandler,"When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. that is the bottom line.",5,20
joey,"Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.",5,20
chandler,From a bullet!,5,20
joey,I know it doesn't make much sense,5,20
chandler,Much sense?!,5,20
joey,"Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!",5,20
chandler,"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!",5,20
joey,"I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!",5,20
chandler,"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.",5,20
joey,No! I would never do that! You-you are like my brother!,5,20
chandler,Really?!,5,20
joey,"Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.",5,20
chandler,Thanks.,5,20
joey,"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",5,20
joey,How good is that?,5,20
chandler,"Oh-oi-ho, yeah!",5,20
joey,See?,5,20
chandler,Hm-hmm.,5,20
joey,"Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!",5,20
chandler,I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.,5,20
joey,Yeah. With a bite!  Gee-e-e-eez!,5,20
rachel,Hey! Hi!,5,20
ross,"Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?",5,20
rachel,"Hey! you know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!",5,20
ross,"You know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you are here. you are my friend, and you are here. Oh!",5,20
rachel,"Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?",5,20
ross,The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!,5,20
rachel,What?! What? What happened?!,5,20
ross,"Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?",5,20
rachel,Yeah!,5,20
ross,And somebody took a shot at me!,5,20
rachel,Really?!,5,20
ross,"No, a car backfired, but  I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. You know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.",5,20
rachel,Because a car backfired?,5,20
ross,"Okay, why are you here?",5,20
rachel,"Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing"" thing but um, Emily called you today.",5,20
ross,You talked to her?,5,20
rachel,"No, she left a message.   But it-it kind of got erased. There's just  something wrong with your machine.",5,20
ross,"Well, okay, what-what did she say?",5,20
rachel,"Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.",5,20
ross,Wow!,5,20
rachel,"Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?",5,20
ross,"Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!",5,20
rachel,"Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Because you know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right.   Your decision.",5,20
ross,"Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.",5,20
rachel,"Okay, no, that is not the right decision. that is not, that is not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?",5,20
ross,"Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!",5,20
rachel,"Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!",5,20
ross,"You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! You know?",5,20
rachel,"Okay, you know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.",5,20
ross,Huh.,5,20
rachel,"I mean, look-look today you escaped   death, you know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?",5,20
ross,"That does make sense. Because I do want to seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't want to see or talk to her.",5,20
rachel,"Well, there you go!",5,20
ross,"Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.",5,20
rachel,Close call day.,5,20
ross,"Hey, thanks Rach.",5,20
rachel,"OH, honey no problem. Okay.",5,20
ross,Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.,5,20
rachel,Oh?,5,20
ross,"""Hey Ross, it's you!""  Oh yeah, no that is-that is an old message, nobody needs to hear that.",5,20
rachel,No.,5,20
ross,"Hey umm, was-was Monica here?",5,20
rachel,Yeah.,5,20
ross,"Yeah, I want my money back.",5,20
rachel,"Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?",5,20
ross,"Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?",5,20
phoebe,"Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kind of did it to himself. It's not really a good story.",5,20
ross,"I wonder how I would react under fire, you know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.",5,20
monica,"Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.",5,20
chandler,Before or after you were shot by your own troops?,5,20
ross,I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.,5,20
chandler,"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.",5,20
joey,"Yeah, hero sandwiches.",5,20
phoebe,"Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.  But you know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.   Not you Joey.",5,20
gary,"Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?",5,21
phoebe,"I'm fine, thanks.",5,21
chandler,"Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?",5,21
monica,No. I think we learned that from the sugar lips incident. I'm going to get some tea.,5,21
chandler,Okay.,5,21
chandler,Hiya doin' pumpkin?,5,21
phoebe,Nope.,5,21
monica,"So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?",5,21
gary,"I know, really well. In fact, I'm going to ask Phoebe to move in with me.",5,21
monica,Oh my God!,5,21
gary,"What do you, what do you think?",5,21
monica,I think that is so great! When are you going to ask her?,5,21
gary,"Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?",5,21
monica,"I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because you know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral",5,21
gary,I'll see you after work sweetie.,5,21
phoebe,Okay. Bye!,5,21
phoebe,"So, what movie should we see?",5,21
monica,Gary's going to ask you to move in with him!!,5,21
phoebe,What?! Really?!,5,21
monica,"He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!",5,21
phoebe,I can't believe this!,5,21
chandler,"Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!",5,21
monica,Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!,5,21
chandler,"Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!",5,21
phoebe,"No, but it is fast. Isn't it?",5,21
monica,oh!,5,21
phoebe,"No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!",5,21
chandler,"So, what are you going to do?",5,21
phoebe,I don't know. I'll just handle it—I'll ask you to talk to him!,5,21
chandler,Me?! Why me?,5,21
phoebe,"Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a…man!",5,21
chandler,"I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, you know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.",5,21
monica,That is so sweet!,5,21
chandler,"Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.",5,21
joey,"Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?",5,21
ross,"Uh-huh, that is why they call it Staten Island.",5,21
joey,oh. I thought it was like Long Island.,5,21
ross,Also an island.,5,21
joey,"Hey, what time is it?",5,21
ross,2,5,21
joey,"Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?",5,21
ross,Are you serious?!,5,21
joey,Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything Because I didn't want to jinx it.,5,21
ross,Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!,5,21
joey,"Oh, I-I, I think that is the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",5,21
rachel,"Hey, you guys",5,21
joey,Hey!,5,21
rachel,Is Monica here?,5,21
joey and ross,No.,5,21
rachel,"All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's going to like it, and it's going to seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.",5,21
ross,You bought Shawn Cassidy!,5,21
rachel,"No! I wish! Okay, you ready?",5,21
joey and ross,Yeah!,5,21
rachel,Okay!  Check it out!,5,21
ross,What-what is it?!,5,21
joey,What the hell is that?!!,5,21
rachel,"It's a, it's a cat!",5,21
joey,"That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}",5,21
rachel,Yes it is!,5,21
ross,Why is it inside out?!,5,21
rachel,"Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!",5,21
ross,How much did you pay for that?,5,21
rachel,"Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.",5,21
ross,Yeah? How much?,5,21
rachel,A thousand bucks.,5,21
ross,ON A CAT??!!!!,5,21
joey,It's not a cat!,5,21
rachel,"All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!",5,21
ross,"Free cats do that too, you know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}",5,21
joey,It's not a cat!,5,21
rachel,"Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm going to go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.  Well, what am I going to call her? Fluffy?!",5,21
ross,"Hey, you want to get something to eat or uh, do you want to see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?",5,21
joey,"Uhh, the ball thing.",5,21
ross,Yeah?,5,21
joey,"Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!",5,21
ross,"Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!",5,21
joey,Okay!,5,21
joey,Uh-oh.,5,21
ross,What?,5,21
joey,I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!,5,21
joey,"Man, I didn't think we were going to make it!",5,21
ross,"I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?",5,21
chandler,Hey ladies! What are you in here for?,5,21
gary,"Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?",5,21
chandler,"Gary, I'm here to report a crime.",5,21
gary,Yeah?,5,21
chandler,It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.,5,21
gary,What's up?,5,21
chandler,"Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.",5,21
gary,Sure. Okay.,5,21
chandler,"Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are going to be you know, live-living together!",5,21
gary,"Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.",5,21
chandler,You mean scared.,5,21
gary,"No, I mean happy.",5,21
chandler,Scared? Happy?,5,21
gary,"Chandler, what-what are you doing?",5,21
chandler,"I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always going to be there. you are going to get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!",5,21
gary,I know! I can't wait!,5,21
chandler,"Were you are parents happy, or something?",5,21
gary,"Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just—I want to be around her as much as I can.",5,21
chandler,"Wow, you know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.",5,21
gary,"So you know what I'm talking about, right?",5,21
chandler,"Yeah, I think I do! You know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!",5,21
gary,"No, it's too soon for you guys.",5,21
chandler,"Yeah, you are right about that.",5,21
ross,now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Palaeozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!,5,21
joey,Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.,5,21
monica,Hey guys!,5,21
joey,Hi!,5,21
monica,"Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night.  It was right here, where is it?",5,21
joey,I don't know.,5,21
monica,"All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!",5,21
ross,How do you know? You don't have a watch.,5,21
monica,"Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!",5,21
joey,"Oh, I don't know…. Yeah, can't do it.",5,21
monica,What?!,5,21
ross,"Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!",5,21
joey,"Yeah, we haven't dropped it in",5,21
ross,"2 hours, 27 minutes.",5,21
monica,Really?!,5,21
monica,"I-I'm not going to be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good.   Yes!!   Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.",5,21
ross,Hey Rach!,5,21
rachel,Hey.,5,21
ross,Check it out! Almost 3 hours without dropping' it!,5,21
rachel,"Oh, wow! Congratulations, that is quite a waste of time.",5,21
monica,Rach?,5,21
rachel,Yeah?,5,21
monica,"You have scratches all over you, what happened?",5,21
rachel,"Well, it's my cat.",5,21
monica,What?!,5,21
rachel,"Oh yeah, I got a cat.",5,21
monica,I don't want a cat!,5,21
joey,"Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.",5,21
ross,Yeah.,5,21
rachel,"You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, ""Rachel!""",5,21
ross,Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.,5,21
monica,What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!,5,21
rachel,"Well, I was going to let you play with it.",5,21
chandler,Hi!,5,21
phoebe,"Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?",5,21
chandler,"Yes I did, and I think you should do it.",5,21
phoebe,What?!,5,21
chandler,"He's a great guy, you know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.",5,21
phoebe,You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!,5,21
chandler,"I’m sorry.  If you ask me, I'd move in with him.",5,21
phoebe,"OH!! God!  Ooh!  Get out of here, good for nothing.",5,21
gary,Hey Chandler.,5,21
chandler,Hey Gar!,5,21
gary,"Hi sweetie.  Hi, can I talk to you for a second?",5,21
phoebe,Yeah! Okay.,5,21
gary,You look very pretty today.,5,21
phoebe,Thanks! Okay.,5,21
gary,Here's the thing.,5,21
phoebe,Yeah?,5,21
gary,You know I really want to move this relationship forward.,5,21
phoebe,Uh-hmm.,5,21
gary,"Because if you are not moving forward, you know you are just moving backwards.",5,21
phoebe,"No that is not true. If you are not moving forward, you are just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.",5,21
gary,Phoebe?,5,21
phoebe,Yeah?,5,21
gary,I want you to move in with me.,5,21
phoebe,That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.,5,21
gary,"Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.",5,21
phoebe,I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.,5,21
gary,Uh-huh.,5,21
phoebe,I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worried it's going to be a big mistake.,5,21
gary,Yeah.,5,21
phoebe,Which is why my answer is yes!,5,21
gary,Really?!,5,21
phoebe,Uh-huh!  I'm so…happy.,5,21
ross,Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!,5,21

chandler,What?,5,21
monica,He's a dropper!,5,21

rachel,"I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!",5,21
ross,"Baking it didn't help, huh?",5,21
monica,"So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?",5,21
rachel,I tried! They won't take her back.,5,21
chandler,Maybe that is because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.,5,21
monica,"Rach, why won't they take it back?",5,21
rachel,"Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?",5,21
monica,"Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.",5,21
rachel,"No Mon that is not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!",5,21
monica,"Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!!  Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.",5,21

gary,All right.,5,21
monica,So you are moving in with him. What happened?,5,21
phoebe,"I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.",5,21
monica,"Why, do you write him a lot?",5,21
phoebe,"No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?",5,21

phoebe,Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!,5,21
gary,"Let me tell you what I think might be going on.  No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me.  Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, ""Yes"" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?",5,21
phoebe,Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts!  I'm sorry!,5,21
gary,Phoebe,5,21
phoebe,Yeah?,5,21

phoebe,that is so sweet.,5,21

gary,"Phoebe, you don't have to say that.",5,21
phoebe,"No, I really want to live with you! I want to move in with you!",5,21
gary,Are you sure?,5,21
phoebe,Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!,5,21

rachel,"Okay, a thousand.",5,21
woman no. 2,I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.,5,21
rachel,"Well, I do, but you are just going to have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.",5,21
woman no. 2,"Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.",5,21
rachel,"Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not going to try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you are robbing me blind! Blind!  Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away!  Damnit!  Cat, can't you at least smile or something?!  Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?",5,21

rachel,"Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!",5,22
dr. miller,"Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.",5,22
rachel,"Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.",5,22
dr. miller,"Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.",5,22

phoebe,Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!,5,22
chandler,"Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?",5,22
joey,"Uh no, not really. It's an independent film you know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.",5,22
chandler,"I see, but once you get your first pay check you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?",5,22
joey,"Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.",5,22
chandler,So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?,5,22

chandler,"Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.",5,22
joey,What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!,5,22
chandler,They're not even paying you! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!,5,22
joey,You know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you are dumping all over my big break.,5,22
chandler,"Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.",5,22
joey,"Is that why you are on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? Because if it is, I'll tell you, I-I-I'd rather be alone.",5,22
chandler,"Oh, you don't want me on the trip?",5,22
joey,Not if you are going to be like this!,5,22
chandler,"All right, I'll tell you what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.",5,22
joey,Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!,5,22
chandler,"All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!",5,22
joey,Fine!  Get out!,5,22
chandler,you are not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.,5,22
joey,Get out!!,5,22
chandler,"All right!!  Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm going to die here.",5,22
ross,"Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?",5,22
phoebe,No.,5,22
ross,Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?,5,22
phoebe,No that made me feel precious.,5,22
monica,"Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!",5,22
ross,Yeah? Sometimes it's,5,22
rachel,"Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.",5,22
ross,"Okay, I'm the baby.",5,22
rachel,Eh! Stop it!,5,22
chandler,Hey!,5,22
monica,Chandler! What are you doing here?,5,22
ross,Hey!,5,22
chandler,Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!,5,22
all,Why?!,5,22
chandler,"I don't know! He went crazy! You know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.",5,22
phoebe,That game should not be played without my supervision.,5,22
chandler,"Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, you know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't going to be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, you know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.",5,22
phoebe,What's in the bag?,5,22
chandler,"Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.  Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?",5,22
phoebe,I do!,5,22
rachel,Okay.,5,22
monica,Not even close.,5,22
rachel,"Okay, then you know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!",5,22
monica,Okay! All right! Let's do it!,5,22
rachel,All right!,5,22
monica,Sit down.,5,22
rachel,All right.,5,22
monica,Put your head back.,5,22
rachel,Yes!,5,22
monica,All right.,5,22
rachel,Okay.,5,22
monica,"Now, open your eyes.",5,22
rachel,"Okay, they are.",5,22
monica,How many fingers am I holding up?,5,22
rachel,Four.,5,22
monica,"Oh my God, I was thinking four.",5,22
rachel,Really?!,5,22
monica,"Yes! All right, you know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?",5,22
rachel,Okay!,5,22
monica,No drops!,5,22
rachel,Great!,5,22
monica,Okay.,5,22
rachel,Okay.,5,22
monica,"On three, 1…2…3!  Now my pillow's all wet!",5,22
rachel,"Well, well, you said it was practice!",5,22
monica,Then why did you move?!,5,22
rachel,Because I knew you were lying!,5,22
monica,"All right, come here!",5,22
rachel,What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!,5,22
monica,I am going… I'm going--Turn it over!  I'm… I am going to get these drops in your eyes.,5,22
rachel,Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!,5,22
rachel,Monica! Stop it!,5,22
monica,Damn! It's empty!,5,22
rachel,"Wow, you know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!",5,22
phoebe,"Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross.  Or-or Rachel!",5,22
monica,Hello?   It's Joey.   I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. You know he's really upset about it.,5,22
joey,Not as upset as he's going to be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!,5,22
monica,What did you do to his sweater vests?,5,22
joey,Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I got to ask her something about the car.,5,22
monica,"Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.",5,22
phoebe,"Hey, dude!",5,22
joey,"Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?",5,22
phoebe,Oh that is my grandma.  And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.,5,22
chandler,Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I want to talk to him!,5,22
phoebe,"Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering…  Okay, I guess he ran out of change.",5,22
chandler,"You know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?",5,22
monica,"Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you are sorry.",5,22
chandler,that is a good idea. I wonder where I could  get a basket of porn,5,22
phoebe,"No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!",5,22
chandler,Really?,5,22
phoebe,You know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. Because that why he could trade it for protection. No. that is prison.,5,22
ross,"Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?",5,22
phoebe,Uh-hmm.,5,22
ross,What do you like better flora or fauna?,5,22
phoebe,Fauna.,5,22
ross,Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?,5,22
phoebe,Garfunkle.,5,22
ross,Why are you mad at me?,5,22
phoebe,You said I was boring--OH!,5,22
ross,When did I say you were boring?!,5,22
phoebe,"Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!",5,22
ross,Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!,5,22
phoebe,"Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!  Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.",5,22
joey,Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! you are leading man is here! Let's get to work.,5,22
stanley,"Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.",5,22
joey,Wh-what?! Why?!,5,22
stanley,"It's a money thing, we don't have any.",5,22
joey,you are kidding right?,5,22
stanley,No.,5,22
joey,What?!,5,22
stanley,"It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.",5,22
joey,"Uh, hang out?! How long?",5,22
stanley,"I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always want to invest in movies! Hey, you are not rich are you?",5,22
joey,No!,5,22
stanley,"Eh, worth a shot.  Look Joey, let me know where you are staying, okay?",5,22
the grip,"Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?",5,22
joey,Yeah.,5,22

joey,"Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!",5,22
monica,"Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?",5,22
joey,"Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I got to go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!",5,22

the husband,Okay!,5,22
joey,"Everybody smile!  Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific!  Kill me. Kill me now.",5,22

rachel,Oh!,5,22

phoebe,Why? Just Because you are too lazy to get up off your touchie?,5,23
rachel,No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.,5,23
phoebe,Okay!,5,23
rachel,Sucker!,5,23
phoebe,Hello?  Hey Joey!,5,23

joey,"Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.",5,23
phoebe,OH! So you are 5639?!,5,23
joey,that is it! Thanks Pheebs!,5,23
chandler,Hey!,5,23
phoebe,"Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?",5,23
chandler,Is that Joey?!  Let me talk to him!,5,23
joey,No!  Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!,5,23
a casino boss,Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!,5,23
phoebe,Who was that?,5,23
joey,"Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and you know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.",5,23
chandler,"You know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not going to let me do it on the phone, I'm going to go down there and do it in person.",5,23
joey,"Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?",5,23
phoebe,Yeah!,5,23

phoebe,Monica! I'm sorry I'm late!  Monica?,5,23
monica,"Phoebe?  Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?",5,23
phoebe,It's okay. What the hell took you so long?,5,23
monica,"Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.",5,23
phoebe,Which Richard?,5,23
monica,The Richard.,5,23
phoebe,Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!,5,23
monica,"No! My ex-boyfriend Richard! You know the tall guy, moustache?",5,23
phoebe,"Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?",5,23
monica,"It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.",5,23
phoebe,That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.,5,23
monica,Really?,5,23
phoebe,"But again, Simmons. Go on.",5,23
monica,"The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!",5,23
phoebe,Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?,5,23
monica,Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.,5,23
phoebe,"Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!",5,23
monica,I know.,5,23
phoebe,Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!,5,23
monica,What?,5,23
phoebe,On a totally different bet.,5,23
chandler,Hey!,5,23
monica,It's almost our anniversary!,5,23
chandler,I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.,5,23
phoebe,Aww! Now you are just my annoying friend Chandler.,5,23
chandler,Huh.,5,23
monica,I got you a present!,5,23
chandler,"Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!",5,23
monica,"I know, but you have to open it today!",5,23
chandler,Okay.,5,23
monica,Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!,5,23
chandler,Wow!,5,23
monica,"For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.",5,23
chandler,Do we have to?,5,23
monica,No.,5,23
chandler,"Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.",5,23
monica,"Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!",5,23
chandler,"Yeah, I think we should see other people.",5,23
monica,"But we can go, right?",5,23
chandler,Yes.,5,23
monica,Okay!,5,23
chandler,It's a great idea.,5,23
phoebe,"Okay, I'm going to go too!",5,23
chandler,"You know Pheebs, it's kind of our  anniversary.",5,23
phoebe,"Oh please, you are not going to ditch again like you did with London.",5,23
monica,"Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!",5,23
phoebe,"Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!",5,23
rachel,Hi!,5,23
phoebe,Hey!,5,23
ross,Hey!,5,23
phoebe,"Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all going to go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You want to go?!",5,23
rachel,"Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.",5,23
phoebe,Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!,5,23
rachel,"Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.",5,23
ross,"Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.",5,23
chandler,Art lover!,5,23
ross,What'd you say?,5,23
chandler,I said art lover.,5,23
ross,Is that supposed to be an insult?,5,23
chandler,"I don't know, I'm very tired.",5,23
ross,"So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.",5,23
rachel,That sounds great.,5,23
ross,Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.,5,23
rachel,"Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.",5,23
phoebe,"Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.",5,23
rachel,No! So I can be by myself. You know? Have a little alone time.,5,23
phoebe,Naked alone time.,5,23
rachel,"No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I want to walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",5,23
phoebe,Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?,5,23
phoebe,"So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?",5,23
chandler,So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.,5,23
phoebe,"Okay, what about after I give you these candies?",5,23
chandler,"Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.",5,23
phoebe,"Ah-ha! Okay,  Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.",5,23
chandler,Happy plane-aversary.,5,23
monica,Aww! I love you!,5,23
chandler,Can I give you a present now?,5,23
monica,Okay!,5,23
chandler,Okay!  Oh man! Don’t tell me I did this!,5,23
monica,"I love the ""I forgot the present"" fake out!",5,23
chandler,"How do you feel about the, ""I really did forgot the present, please forgive me"" not fake out?",5,23
monica,"Oh that is okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.",5,23
chandler,OH that is the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!,5,23
phoebe,"Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.",5,23
chandler,What-what Richard thing?,5,23
phoebe,Oh no.,5,23
chandler,What Richard thing?,5,23
phoebe,Simmons! Go with Simmons!,5,23
monica,"Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.",5,23
chandler,I'm not mad.,5,23
monica,Really?!,5,23
chandler,"Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.",5,23
monica,Great!,5,23
phoebe,"Okay, London 1",5,23
rachel,"Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.}  Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen…naked! I'm picking up an orange.  I'm naked!  Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.",5,23
ross,"Oh my God! that is Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this.  Okay, vivid colours, expressive brush strokes—Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! you are being silly! Or, am I?",5,23
rachel,"Love to love you baby! Ow! Love to love you baby! Ow!  Love to love you, baby!  Darnit!  Ugh.",5,23
ross,Hey.,5,23
ross,May I come in?,5,23
rachel,"Uh, yeah, if you want too.",5,23
ross,Do you want me too?,5,23
rachel,"Yeah, sure?",5,23
ross,"So do I.  Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.  This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us.""  Okay? I just want this to be  about what it is!",5,23
rachel,"And um, what-what is that Ross?",5,23
ross,The physical act of love.,5,23
rachel,What?! Are you crazy?,5,23
ross,Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?,5,23
rachel,"Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!",5,23
ross,You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.,5,23
rachel,"No!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!",5,23
ross,No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no.,5,23
rachel,"OH wow! I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!",5,23
ross,"Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?",5,23
rachel,"Yes of course, absolutely! you are right. I'm sorry.",5,23
ross,Thank you.,5,23
rachel,Yes.,5,23
ross,"All right I guess I'm, going to go pack.",5,23
rachel,"Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of ""us?""",5,23
phoebe,"Hey you guys wait! Guys!  This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!",5,23
monica,"Phoebe, you don't eat animals.",5,23
phoebe,"For 99 cents, I'd eat you.  Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look!  Oh! Look! Hi!",5,23
chandler,Oh my God.,5,23
phoebe,Hey! Joey!  Hey! Hey!! Wow!,5,23
joey,Hi!,5,23
chandler,Love your condoms my man.,5,23
joey,What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.,5,23
phoebe,Why are you dressed as a gladiator?,5,23
joey,"Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, you know what? Hold-hold on a second.  Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm going to take a little break.",5,23
monica,Who are you talking too?,5,23
joey,"They uh director. Uhh, her.  All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.",5,23
chandler,Why?! What happened?!,5,23
joey,"Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.",5,23
monica,I'm so sorry.,5,23
joey,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you.  I'm sorry man.",5,23
chandler,"No-no, that is okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.",5,23
monica,I knew you were not okay with that.,5,23
phoebe,So you are a gladiator! Wow!,5,23
joey,"Yeah, what-what's going on?",5,23
phoebe,Monica had lunch with Richard.,5,23
joey,Dawson?!,5,23
phoebe,No! But that would've been so cool!,5,23
chandler,No! Her boyfriend Richard!,5,23
monica,"It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?",5,23
chandler,When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!,5,23
monica,you are right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.,5,23
chandler,Thanks.,5,23
joey,"Aww, there we go.",5,23
phoebe,I love Vegas!,5,23
monica,"I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.",5,23
chandler,Next time?,5,23
joey,"Ooh, so close.",5,23
chandler,There's not going to be a next time! You can not ever see him again!,5,23
monica,"I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!",5,23
chandler,"that is so funny, because I think I just did!",5,23
monica,"OH you know what? If you are going to be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.",5,23
chandler,Fine with me!,5,23
monica,Fine! Happy Anniversary!,5,23
joey,Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.,5,23
monica,No it is not!,5,23
chandler,What are you talking,5,23
joey,Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!,5,23
rachel,"Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.",5,23
ross,Yep! that is hilarious!,5,23
rachel,I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.,5,23
ross,"You know, last night was embarrassing for you too.",5,23
rachel,"No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.",5,23
ross,Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.,5,23
rachel,"Okay. All right, that is true! But you know I just don't embarrass that easily.",5,23
ross,What?! You totally get embarrassed!,5,23
rachel,"No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.",5,23
ross,Is that so?,5,23
rachel,Yeah.,5,23
ross,Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not going to to have sex with you in the bathroom!,5,23
joey,"Hey, you know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.",5,23
chandler,Really?,5,23
joey,"Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right",5,23
chandler,"Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.",5,23
joey,"All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.",5,23
chandler,Whoa!,5,23

joey,Sure?,6,1
phoebe,"All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stopped loving you.",6,1
chandler,Hi!,6,1
joey,Hey.,6,1
monica,Hey.,6,1
chandler,"So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?",6,1
phoebe,"Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.",6,1
joey,Where is the waitress?! I’m starving!,6,1
chandler,It’s a buffet man.,6,1
joey,"Oh, here’s where I win all my money back!",6,1
chandler,"Listen, I got to talk to you.",6,1
joey,Sure! What’s up?,6,1
chandler,Monica and I almost got married last night.,6,1
joey,"Oh my God! That’s huge!  Wait a minute, why come I wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say, ""Ross."" Do not say, ""Ross.""",6,1
chandler,"Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! you know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. you know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?",6,1
joey,Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material.,6,1
chandler,What?!,6,1
joey,"Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything like me, she’s just going to be relieved.",6,1
monica,"How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s going to break his heart, he’s not going to think that I don’t love him anymore.",6,1
phoebe,Well you don’t.,6,1
monica,Yes I do!,6,1
phoebe,Good! Good! I was just testing you.,6,1
chandler,Hi.,6,1
monica,"Oh hi! Hi! you know, we were just talking about bacon.",6,1
phoebe,"No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.",6,1
ross,Hey!,6,1
the girls,Hey!,6,1
chandler,Hey!,6,1
ross,What?,6,1
chandler,Are we going to talk about what you guys did last night? Or,6,1
rachel,"I don’t know.  What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.",6,1
ross,Yeah!,6,1
phoebe,Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.,6,1
monica,Rach! We weren’t going to miss our friends getting married!,6,1
rachel,Who got married?!,6,1
chandler,You did.,6,1
ross,What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.,6,1
rachel,"No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!",6,1
ross,We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.,6,1
rachel,Oh my God.,6,1
ross,I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!,6,1
rachel,No!,6,1
joey,They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!,6,1
phoebe,"Hell, I’m drunk right now!  What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!",6,1
monica,What are you guys going to do?,6,1
rachel,"Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?",6,1
chandler,"Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.",6,1
ross,"Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? We we’re just going to get an annulment.",6,1
joey,An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.,6,1
phoebe,"Oh-oh, that’s your thing.",6,1
ross,What?,6,1
phoebe,You’re thing. You’re thing. you know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.,6,1
all,Oh yeah!,6,1
ross,"No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!",6,1
phoebe,"Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably going to marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re going to have to divorce it, divorcing guy.  I’m so drunk.",6,1
monica,"So, what do you think we should do?",6,1
chandler,I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!,6,1
monica,I know I love you!,6,1
chandler,So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.,6,1
monica,"That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!",6,1
chandler,"Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.",6,1
monica,"All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married.",6,1
chandler,Sounds great.,6,1
monica,Okay.,6,1
croupler,"Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.",6,1
monica,Ready?,6,1
chandler,Ready!,6,1
monica,Come on eight.,6,1
chandler,"Yes, yes eight.",6,1
croupler,Eight! Easy eight.,6,1
monica,Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.,6,1
chandler,"That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.",6,1
monica,Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.,6,1
chandler,"That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!",6,1
monica,I wanted it so bad!  want to go pack?,6,1
chandler,"Yeah.  We’re doing the right thing, right?",6,1
monica,"OH, of course we are!  We left it up to fate.  If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.",6,1
phoebe,"Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any  QUESTIONS!!!",6,1
joey,What?!,6,1
phoebe,"Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!",6,1
joey,All right. All right.,6,1
phoebe,Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.,6,1
joey,Really? I don’t,6,1
phoebe,Sing!!,6,1
joey,I want to rock and roll all night!,6,1
joey,"Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!",6,1
hitchhiker,Morning!,6,1
ross,Hey!,6,1
rachel,"Hey, hubby!",6,1
ross,"Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?",6,1
rachel,Uh-huh.,6,1
ross,I’m not going to do that.,6,1
rachel,"Okay! So, we’ll just stay married.",6,1
ross,"Yes, exactly!",6,1
rachel,And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!,6,1
ross,"Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.",6,1
rachel,"Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.",6,1
ross,"I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not going to be that guy!",6,1
rachel,What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!,6,1
ross,"Okay, look, how is this going to affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!",6,1
rachel,"OH, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. you know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.",6,1
ross,I’m asking you to do me a favour.,6,1
rachel,You are asking me to be your wife!,6,1
ross,And as my wife I think you should grant me this favour.,6,1
monica,That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.,6,1
chandler,Well you did pull his hair.,6,1
monica,He took my snack!,6,1
chandler,I’m not getting into this again!,6,1
monica,"Okay! Oh God, you know what? It’s really bad.",6,1
chandler,"Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.",6,1
monica,"This doesn’t mean anything, does it?",6,1
chandler,No!,6,1
monica,Okay.,6,1
phoebe,"How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape—, a rapist or a killer or something!",6,1
joey,Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!,6,1
phoebe,"you know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!",6,1
hitchhiker,No!,6,1
phoebe,Do you like car games?,6,1
hitchhiker,"Yeah, you know the license plate game?",6,1
phoebe,I love the license plate game!,6,1
joey,"Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play!",6,1
phoebe,No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!,6,1
ross,Hey!,6,1
rachel,Hey!,6,1
ross,"Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married.  We register, and you get to keep all the presents!",6,1
rachel,"No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.",6,1
ross,I don’t know if it’s true.,6,1
rachel,Oh b-b-but it is!,6,1
ross,"Oh, okay, you know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...",6,1
rachel,"Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!",6,1
ross,"All right. All right, I’ll do it.",6,1
rachel,"Thank you.  Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?",6,1
hitchhiker,Wait! Wait! There is the train station!,6,1
phoebe,"Oh, okay.",6,1
hitchhiker,"This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.",6,1
phoebe,"And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court.",6,1
hitchhiker,"All right, see you Pheebs.",6,1
joey,"Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh?  Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!",6,1
phoebe,Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! you know I can’t resist that beautiful voice!,6,1
joey,"Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.",6,1
phoebe,You can still sleep at night and stuff.,6,1
joey,"Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas.",6,1
phoebe,Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?,6,1
joey,Yes.,6,1
phoebe,Is it a meatball sub?,6,1
joey,That is incredible! You are the master!,6,1
rachel,"Huh, that’s funny. You look like you’re going to be the",6,1

rachel,"All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.",6,1
chandler,"All right, should we just, should we just get married? you know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.",6,1
monica,"I’m sick of the signs! It’s too fast, I’m happy the way things are!",6,1
chandler,Me too!,6,1
monica,I don’t want things to change! Do you?,6,1
chandler,No!,6,1
monica,"All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving me insane!",6,1
chandler,"Jeez, relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!!",6,1
chandler,"you know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?",6,1
monica,Then all your stuff would be here.,6,1
chandler,"Well, what if all my stuff was here?",6,1
monica,"Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.",6,1
chandler,Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?,6,1
monica,Live together? There have been no signs for that.,6,1
chandler,Me asking is kind of a sign.,6,1
monica,YES!!!!!!!!,6,1
chandler,Okay!!!!!,6,1
monica,Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!,6,1

monica,Oh my God it’s old!,6,1
chandler,I love you!,6,1
monica,I love you!,6,1
chandler,Are you hugging the door right now.,6,1
monica,No.,6,1
chandler,"Yeah-yeah, me neither.",6,1

rachel,"Okay, umm, I’m going to get my sweater.",6,1
ross,"Okay.  You uh, you want to hear something weird?",6,1
phoebe,Always.,6,1

phoebe,"Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?",6,2
rachel,"Oh but Phoebe, we’re going to be late for the movie.",6,2
phoebe,"Oh, there’s a cab! Taxi!!  Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.",6,2
rachel,"Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just going to walk because it’s right up there at the Angelica.",6,2
phoebe,"Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go!   You didn’t get the annulment?!!",6,2
ross,I know.,6,2
phoebe,Ross?!,6,2
ross,"Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was, ""Three divorces. Three divorces!"" Look, I just don’t want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.",6,2
phoebe,"Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! you know? Mine’s going to say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.",6,2
ross,"Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!",6,2
phoebe,"So okay what? You’re going to be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!—Op, woman! Sorry.",6,2
ross,"Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?",6,2
phoebe,"Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!",6,2
rachel,"Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!",6,2
phoebe,Hey Rach!,6,2
rachel,What was that?!,6,2
phoebe,"Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?",6,2

phoebe,Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!,6,2
rachel,No!!,6,2
chandler,"you know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?",6,2
monica,Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?,6,2
chandler,"No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict.",6,2
monica,"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?",6,2
chandler,"No, no, I keep trying, you know? I can get out, ""Joey, I have too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom."" He may think I’m sick.",6,2
monica,"you know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with! you know, the next time we see them we’re just going to tell them. Okay? That’s it.",6,2
chandler,"Oh, so that’s this is going to work now? You’re just going to order me around all the time?",6,2
monica,Pretty much.,6,2

joey,"Hey man, you feeling any better?",6,2
monica,"Joey, we have something to tell you.",6,2
joey,Oh my God! You’re pregnant!,6,2
chandler,"No-o-o!  No?  No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m going to be moving out man.",6,2
joey,"Wow!  Well, uh… Hey! I’m really happy for you guys! Congratulations!  See you later.",6,2
monica,Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!,6,2
joey,"Yeah, I got to go! I got an acting job.  Like you’d believe that. This sucks!",6,2
chandler,"Look, I-I’m just going to be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!",6,2
joey,"Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you’re going to be moving in with him I feel it’s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He’s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm… Oh-oh he always, he always umm—Oh, who am I kidding! He’s the best roommate ever!",6,2
monica,Hey Pheebs!,6,2
phoebe,Hey!,6,2
monica,"Hey, have you seen Rachel?",6,2
phoebe,"No, why?",6,2
monica,I have some pretty exciting news!,6,2
phoebe,You’re pregnant!,6,2
monica,No! Chandler and I are moving in together!,6,2
phoebe,"Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint",6,2
ross,Hey! Hi!,6,2
monica,Hey!,6,2
ross,What’s up?,6,2
monica,"Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.",6,2
ross,"Oh my God. OH, my little sister and my best friend…shaking up. Oh, that’s great. That’s great.",6,2
phoebe,"Guys, I’m happy too.",6,2
monica,"Okay, come here!",6,2
phoebe,"Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled",6,2
monica,"Okay, I got to go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?",6,2
ross,Bye.,6,2
phoebe,"Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!",6,2
ross,"Could you just, could you just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!",6,2
phoebe,"Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates",6,2
ross,"No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.",6,2
phoebe,"Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!",6,2
ross,Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?,6,2
phoebe,"you know that’s really fair. you know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here.",6,2
ross,What?! Why?,6,2
phoebe,"Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?",6,2
ross,"And if you wait right here, I’ll go get Ross.",6,2
chandler,Hey!,6,2
monica,"Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!",6,2
chandler,What gave me away?,6,2
monica,"I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she’s the only one left!",6,2
chandler,"Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official, we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are you scared? Are you?",6,2
monica,No.,6,2
chandler,Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.,6,2
rachel,Hey!,6,2
chandler,Hey.,6,2
rachel,"Ugh, the worse day! you know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.",6,2
chandler,"Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap.  Seriously.",6,2
rachel,"I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!",6,2
chandler,"Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty",6,2
rachel,What?,6,2
chandler,All yours babe.,6,2
monica,"Have a seat.  Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.",6,2
rachel,Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys!,6,2
monica,Really?!,6,2
rachel,"And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are going to have such a good time living together!",6,2
monica,"Yes, we are.",6,2
rachel,"And Chandler, you’re going to have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late.",6,2
chandler,Rach,6,2
monica,"Yeah, he’s going to work on that.",6,2
rachel,OH! This is so exciting! Oh God…  Come and knock on my door,6,2
monica,We’ll be waiting for you,6,2
ross,"once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.",6,2
phoebe,"Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?",6,2
stephanie,"Well the divorces don’t bother me, I’d date him. But, not while he’s still married.",6,2
phoebe,"Okay, what about you?  Wouldn’t you want a date?",6,2
karin,"Actually, I’m dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like you know bad for me, so until I work that out",6,2
phoebe,Whatever! What about you Meg?,6,2
meg,"Well, I don’t care about the divorces either, but I wouldn’t date him. It’s just that he’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.",6,2
ross,What?!,6,2
phoebe,"She said, ""He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.""",6,2
ross,"This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?",6,2
phoebe,"Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.",6,2
ross,"We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!",6,2
phoebe,Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!,6,2
ross,"Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times.",6,2
phoebe,"Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, ""Well done!"" Bravo Meg.",6,2
ross,"Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth——Nothing!!",6,2
meg,Okay now I wouldn’t date you because you seem a little creepy.,6,2
karin,I am so attracted to him right now.,6,2
chandler,"Okay, when are we going to tell Rachel what is actually going to happen?",6,2
monica,"Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!",6,2
chandler,"Well, Joey’s my best friend.",6,2
monica,I’m not your best friend?,6,2
chandler,You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?,6,2
monica,"All right, all right, at least I’m prepared.",6,2
chandler,Okay.  Oh yes.,6,2
monica,Hey!,6,2

chandler,I am now!,6,2
rachel,Hey roomie!,6,2
chandler,"Okay, bye!",6,2
monica,"Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you.",6,2
rachel,Are you pregnant?!,6,2
monica,"No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.",6,2
rachel,Um-hmm.,6,2
monica,"Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.",6,2
rachel,"Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I did that.",6,2
monica,"Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s absolutely no rush.",6,2
rachel,Okay.,6,2
monica,Okay. Don’t you want a cookie?,6,2
rachel,Sure?  Thanks.,6,2
monica,"Maybe, do you need a tissue?",6,2
rachel,"Monica, where did you get these?!",6,2
monica,I made them!,6,2
rachel,"Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy!",6,2
joey,"God, it’s going to so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. you know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. ""You want to go over to Joey and Chandler’s?"" ""Can’t, its not there.""",6,2
chandler,"Look, I’m just going to be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",6,2
joey,Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,6,2
chandler,Not once did we do that.,6,2
monica,Hi.,6,2
chandler,Hey!,6,2
joey,Hi.,6,2
monica,"So I, I told Rachel it was just going to be the two of us.",6,2
chandler,"Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",6,2
monica,"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad.",6,2
chandler,And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?,6,2
monica,"I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",6,2
joey,Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s!!,6,2
chandler,"Okay, I got to ask, who calls us that?!",6,2
russell,You got married again.,6,2
ross,Yes.,6,2
russell,So that’s your second marriage in two years.,6,2
ross,"Yes, second in two years. Third overall.",6,2
russell,"Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don’t you tell me what happened.",6,2
ross,"Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk",6,2
russell,"I’m sorry, is this the same Rachel who’s name you said at the altar in the second marriage?",6,2
ross,"Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.",6,2
russell,"Oh, that’s better then.",6,2
ross,This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.,6,2
russell,I see. Have you considered therapy?,6,2
ross,I think just the annulment for today.,6,2
russell,There are a couple of forms to fill out.,6,2
ross,Easy.,6,2
russell,"And we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.",6,2
ross,No problem.,6,2
russell,And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.,6,2
ross,"Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? Because I kind of all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.",6,2
russell,"Of course you did. Look Ross, you can’t get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.",6,2
ross,"Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel?  I will think about the therapy.",6,2
rachel,Hey!,6,2
monica,"Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.",6,2
rachel,Okay!,6,2
monica,"you know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.",6,2
rachel,Okay.,6,2
monica,"Hey Rach, what about this?  Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be you know, too many memories!",6,2
rachel,What the hell is that?,6,2
monica,"I don’t know.  Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.",6,2
rachel,"Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!",6,2
monica,Something to remember me by!,6,2
rachel,"Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. you know, I mean we’re going to see each other all the time.",6,2
monica,"But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!",6,2
rachel,Are you okay? You’re not blinking.,6,2
monica,"I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era.",6,2
rachel,"Oh, all right. But you know I got to say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.",6,2
monica,"An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!",6,2
rachel,What is the matter with you?!,6,2
monica,What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you going to be sad that we’re not going to be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you going to miss me at all?!,6,2
rachel,"All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.",6,2
monica,What’s hard to believe?,6,2
rachel,"Well you know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! you know? I mean, you-you were going to get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.",6,2
monica,"Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is going to move in here.",6,2
rachel,But I,6,2
monica,"No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.",6,2
rachel,It is? Really?,6,2
monica,"Yeah, sweetie.",6,2
rachel,"I mean we’re not, we’re not going to live together anymore?",6,2
monica,No.,6,2
rachel,What? Oh my God! I’m going to miss you so much!,6,2
monica,I’m going to miss you!,6,2
rachel,I mean it’s the end of an era!,6,2
monica,I know!,6,2
phoebe,"Okay, bye!",6,2
ross,Oh no.,6,2
phoebe,So? Did you get the annulment?,6,2
ross,I couldn’t.,6,2
phoebe,I knew it! Because you love Rachel.,6,2
ross,It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I,6,2
phoebe,"Yeah, complicated because of the love.",6,2
ross,"I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m going to tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?",6,2
phoebe,I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.,6,2
ross,I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!,6,2
ross,"OH, what’s wrong?!",6,2
rachel,Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.,6,2
ross,Oh my—Come here! Come here!  It’s okay. Everything’s going to be okay.,6,2
rachel,Thank you.,6,2
ross,Of course.,6,2
joey,"So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?",6,2
phoebe,"Oh we do, but not just yet.",6,2
joey,"Really?! Well, when?",6,2
phoebe,"Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.",6,2
joey,Wow.,6,2
phoebe,"I know. Then, I’m going to marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.",6,2
joey,Great!,6,2
phoebe,But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.,6,2
joey,"Oh-oh, what about Ross?",6,2
phoebe,"I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.",6,2
chandler,Hey!,6,3
phoebe,Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!,6,3
joey,Dude! What are you—you trying to kill me?!,6,3
rachel,"Pheebs, I want to ask you something.",6,3
phoebe,"Uh-huh, what?",6,3
rachel,Well since I’m moving’ out and-and you’re so beautiful,6,3
phoebe,Oh!,6,3
rachel,how about I move in with you?,6,3
phoebe,"Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?",6,3
monica,Who’s Denise?,6,3
phoebe,My roommate.,6,3
rachel,You have a roommate?!,6,3
phoebe,"Yes, Denise. Denise!",6,3
joey,"Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?",6,3
chandler,"Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?",6,3
phoebe,Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!,6,3
joey,"Hey Rach, listen I was thinking’ uh, I’m going to have an extra room over at my place",6,3
rachel,"Oh, that’s true.",6,3
joey,"Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?",6,3
rachel,"Yeah, yeah I think I’m going to find my own place.",6,3
chandler,Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!,6,3
phoebe,Hey.,6,3
ross,Hey!,6,3
phoebe,"So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?",6,3
ross,"Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.",6,3
phoebe,You didn’t tell her did you?,6,3
ross,No.,6,3
phoebe,"Of course not, because you’re in love with her.",6,3
ross,"I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.",6,3
phoebe,"What do you mean, comforted her?",6,3
ross,"It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug.",6,3
phoebe,"Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!",6,3
ross,It’s also a sign of friendship.,6,3
phoebe,"Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.",6,3
ross,It was a hug!,6,3
phoebe,"Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?",6,3
ross,S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?,6,3
phoebe,"Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them!  Oh come on Ross, you’re a scientist.",6,3
ross,"I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty.  What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!",6,3
phoebe,"Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.",6,3
ross,"If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!",6,3
phoebe,"Okay, I didn’t understand that, but you know, maybe that’s because you were speaking the secret language of love!",6,3
joey,"Hey!  Dude, some guy just called for you.",6,3
chandler,Who was it?,6,3
joey,"I don’t know! How about, ""Thanks for taking the message."" Jeez!",6,3
monica,"Okay listen, you know when you move in Rachel’s room is going to be empty, you want to talk about what we want to do with it?",6,3
chandler,Sure!,6,3
monica,"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",6,3
chandler,"Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, you know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!",6,3
monica,No.,6,3
chandler,"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely.""",6,3
monica,"Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.",6,3
chandler,"So, that’s it?",6,3
monica,I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is going to be filled with antiques.,6,3
chandler,Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!,6,3
monica,What do you have against the beautiful guest room?,6,3
chandler,"I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",6,3
monica,Are you mocking me?,6,3
chandler,"No, I’m not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.",6,3
joey,"Hey, what’s up?",6,3
chandler,"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.",6,3
joey,"But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.",6,3
chandler,"""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" Nice!",6,3
joey,"Yeah? I just figured you know, after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, you know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different than me; a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh?  Not just a hat rack my friend!",6,3
rachel,"Pheebs, I have to ask you",6,3
phoebe,Shh! I’m swamped right now.,6,3
rachel,You’re just staring into space.,6,3
phoebe,"Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil.",6,3
rachel,This one?,6,3
phoebe,It worked!,6,3
rachel,"Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this;  ""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" It’s just, there is nothing! The city’s full!",6,3
phoebe,"Wait, no, look at this!   ""Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay…"" Oh, yeah, but it’s on the ground floor.",6,3
ross,Hey!,6,3
rachel,Hey.,6,3
ross,"Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?",6,3
rachel,Yeah! Why?,6,3
ross,"Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?",6,3
rachel,That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!,6,3
ross,"Don’t thank me! If you want to thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.  Here’s Warren’s number.",6,3
rachel,"Oh, this is great! I am going to call him right now!  Oh, thank you!",6,3
ross,"Okay, you go grab it!",6,3
phoebe,I saw it.,6,3
ross,I don’t know what you’re talking about.,6,3
phoebe,"Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again; you re-love her!",6,3
ross,"Look, I do not re-love her.",6,3
phoebe,"I can’t believe you won’t just admit it!  Okay, just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.",6,3
ross,"Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?",6,3
rachel,"Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never going to find anything.",6,3
ross,You can live with me.,6,3
rachel,What?!,6,3
phoebe,What?!,6,3
ross,What?,6,3
rachel,Oh my God! Are you serious?!,6,3
ross,Uh-huh.,6,3
rachel,I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!,6,3
ross,"Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, you know, help you out.",6,3
phoebe,"Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys.  This is so-so, not stupid.",6,3
rachel,"Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was going to be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!",6,3
ross,"Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right.",6,3
rachel,"Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!",6,3
ross,"Oh please!   You’re going to say things now, aren’t you?",6,3
phoebe,"No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me!   Okay, that’s a lie.",6,3
chandler,Hi.,6,3
monica,Hi.,6,3
chandler,"Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls, and now I can ‘them—Now, I have you.  Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women",6,3
monica,Stop it Chandler.  I’m sorry too.,6,3
chandler,Really?,6,3
monica,Yeah! Oh yes!,6,3
chandler,OH.,6,3
monica,"Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.",6,3
chandler,That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.,6,3
monica,Totally!,6,3
chandler,We don’t have to come up with this now.,6,3
monica,Oh good.,6,3
chandler,"Hey, you know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?",6,3
monica,Changes?,6,3
chandler,"Yeah, I mean we’re going to have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.",6,3
monica,You’re-you’re-you’re going to bring the Barca Lounger over here?,6,3
chandler,Is that a problem?,6,3
monica,"Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together.",6,3
chandler,"Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.",6,3
monica,See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.,6,3
chandler,"Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!",6,3
monica,"Yeah-yeah, you know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t match! Where is it going to go?!",6,3
chandler,In the game room!,6,3
monica,Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!,6,3
chandler,All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma’s place!!,6,3
joey,"Everything on your application looks really good—OH! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends going to be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",6,3
the potential roommate,"Oh don’t worry, I’m not really a party girl.",6,3
joey,"Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurting’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?",6,3
chandler,You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I’ll be living here.,6,3
joey,"Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s going to get it.",6,3
chandler,Why did you take the shower curtain down?,6,3
joey,That thing was a hazard!  I’m very safety conscious.,6,3
rachel,Hey!,6,3
ross,"Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.",6,3
rachel,"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.",6,3
ross,"What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?",6,3
rachel,"No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.",6,3
ross,What?! Over a stupid room!,6,3
rachel,"Yeah, I feel kind of bad for them, but I’m also really psyched because I don’t have to move in here!",6,3
ross,"Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!",6,3
ross,"What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",6,3
monica,"Ross, we can handle this.",6,3
ross,"Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!",6,3
chandler,"Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!",6,3
ross,"Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",6,3
chandler,"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",6,3
monica,Love is the best medicine.,6,3
chandler,That’s laughter.,6,3
monica,Why do you do it?,6,3
chandler,I don’t know.,6,3
ross,"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you want to live with Monica, right?",6,3
chandler,"Yeah, I do.",6,3
ross,"And Mon, you want to live with Chandler, don’t you?",6,3
monica,Yes.,6,3
ross,Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!,6,3
gunther,So I understand you’re looking for a place.,6,3
rachel,"No-no, I’m staying put.",6,3
gunther,"Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.",6,3
rachel,"Why, where are you going?",6,3
gunther,I don’t know.,6,3
ross,Hey Rach!,6,3
rachel,Hi!,6,3
ross,"You’re never going to believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?",6,3
rachel,Oh wow.,6,3
ross,"Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.",6,3
rachel,"Yeah. you know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s going to be weird?",6,3
ross,"Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?",6,3
rachel,"Well, because of us! Because of our history.",6,3
ross,No!,6,3
rachel,No?,6,3
ross,"No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?",6,3
rachel,No! Not at all!,6,3
ross,Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.,6,3
rachel,"Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are going to be dating.",6,3
ross,Really?! We are?,6,3
rachel,"Yeah! I’m going to have a boyfriend, you’re going to have a girlfriend",6,3
ross,OH! That would be great.,6,3
rachel,"But you know what, if you think it’s going to be okay we’ll just work out a system. you know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, ""Come back later, I’m getting’ lucky.""",6,3
ross,"Yeah, I didn’t think of that.",6,3
ross,So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!,6,3
monica,That’s very funny!,6,3
chandler,"He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!",6,3
ross,"No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing you know you break up!",6,3
monica,"Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.",6,3
ross,"Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room, this is about what the room…represents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!",6,3
chandler,"Yeah, I'm not so worried.",6,3
monica,"Yeah, no, me neither.",6,3
ross,"Fine! It’s your life!  I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together,  but that’s what you want, there’s nothing I can do.  DON’T DO IT!!!!!",6,3
monica,You still want to move in together right?,6,3
chandler,Of course!,6,3
monica,Ross didn’t scare you?,6,3
chandler,Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.,6,3
monica,"Come here, I want to show you something!",6,3
chandler,Okay!,6,3
chandler,Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!,6,3
monica,This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen.,6,3
chandler,Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!,6,3
monica,Okay!,6,3
chandler,"you know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""Merge?""",6,3
monica,Uh-hmm.,6,3
chandler,"you know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!",6,3
monica,Oh my God! I love that!,6,3
chandler,Really?!,6,3
monica,"Uh, no!!",6,3

rachel,"Umm, well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.",6,3
ross,Fighting?!,6,3
rachel,"No, the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things out.",6,3
ross,"Yeah. There’s no breaking them up, is there?",6,3
rachel,"Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?",6,3

rachel,"Thank you.  Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there’s no turning back.",6,3
ross,"Yeah, I’m-I’m sure.  Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.",6,3
joey,"Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?",6,3
ross,I’ve been back and forth.,6,3
joey,"Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together!",6,3
ross,"Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked about you know, dating other guys.",6,3
joey,"That’s not going to work out! Then she’s going to come home all weepy and you’ll be telling’ her, ""Oh that’s okay. You’ll find someone."" And then, bam! She finds you!",6,3
ross,"Yeah, well, m-maybe you’re right.",6,3
joey,"I am telling you Ross, she is definitely going to fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?",6,3
ross,Is that what I want?,6,3
phoebe,Yes.,6,3
joey,"Here she comes. Hold on, I’m going to make your life much easier.",6,3
rachel,"All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.",6,3

ross,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!",6,3
joey,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!",6,3
rachel,"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.",6,3
joey,"Thursday’s clearly not good for you, pick a day!",6,3
joey,Hi!,6,3
the potential roommate,Hi!,6,3
joey,"Come in. Thanks for coming’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!",6,3
the potential roommate,Great!,6,3
joey,"Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m going to say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.",6,3
the potential roommate,I can do that.,6,3

monica,This bottle opener.,6,4
rachel,And?,6,4
monica,And it’s a magnet!,6,4
rachel,Look at that!,6,4
ross,"How weird is that? you know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me  kitchen.",6,4
rachel,What?!,6,4
ross,"You complete me kitchen, matey!",6,4
phoebe,"Ross, I know what you’re thinking.",6,4
ross,What?,6,4
phoebe,"That she’s going to move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. you know? You’re just, you’re very sad.",6,4
ross,Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!,6,4
phoebe,What?!!,6,4
ross,"Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always, ""Ross, what are you going to do about Rachel?"" ""Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?"" ""When are you going to confess your secret marriage to Rachel?"" You want her!",6,4
phoebe,No!,6,4
ross,"Uh-oh, saved by the bell.  Hello?",6,4
monica,"Hey Rach, aren’t these candlesticks  mine?",6,4
rachel,"No-no, I bought those.",6,4
monica,"OH! Yeah, I forgot.",6,4
rachel,Yeah.,6,4
monica,That you’re a liar.,6,4
ross,"No-no-no, that’s great! I’ll be there Monday. And thank you again!  Okay.   Umm, that was the head of the Palaeontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!",6,4
monica,"Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?",6,4
ross,"Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.",6,4
rachel,"Well, who wouldn’t?!",6,4
ross,"I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? ""Professor Geller.""",6,4
phoebe,"Yeah, Professor and Mrs.",6,4
rachel,And Mrs.?!,6,4
phoebe,"Oh! Yeah, you know you and Ross are still married.",6,4
rachel,What?!!,6,4

chandler,Hey!,6,4
phoebe,Hi.,6,4
monica,Hey!,6,4
chandler,"Oh, what’s the matter?",6,4
phoebe,"Well, you know that psychic I see?",6,4
chandler,Yeah?,6,4
phoebe,"Well, she told me that I’m going to die this week, so I’m kind of bummed about that.",6,4
chandler,What?!,6,4
phoebe,"Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.",6,4
monica,Phoebe that’s crazy!,6,4
joey,I can’t believe she would say that too you.,6,4
rachel,Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?,6,4
phoebe,I don’t—she said you know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.,6,4
chandler,Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re going to go?,6,4
phoebe,"No, because she didn’t tell me I was going to die until the very end of the session, and I was not going to waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left, you know? I’ve really got to start living now!",6,4
ross,Hey everyone!,6,4
chandler,Oh hi!,6,4
ross,"Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kind of wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?",6,4
all,Oh that’d be great. Sure!,6,4
ross,"""There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…""",6,4
phoebe,"Oh, this is it. This what’s going to kill me.",6,4
ross,"""…subcategories. The first of these subcategories is…""",6,4
joey,"Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?",6,4
ross,No! Why?,6,4
joey,"Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it.",6,4
ross,"OH! Okay! Okay.  ""There are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.   Each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  into…""",6,4
chandler,Why don’t you open with a joke?,6,4
ross,"Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!",6,4
chandler,"Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!",6,4
ross,Okay!,6,4
all,"OH! We’re kidding! Oh, we’re kidding!",6,4
rachel,"Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?",6,4
ross,Thank you!,6,4
rachel,"Some uh, some visual aides.",6,4
joey,Oh-ooh-ooh! you know what’s a good visual aide?,6,4
ross,Please don’t say naked chicks.,6,4
joey,Why not?!,6,4
ross,I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. you know what? I’m just going to do it on my own with no naked chicks.,6,4
chandler,That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.,6,4
chandler,Hey.,6,4
joey,Hey! Any good mail?,6,4
chandler,"Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.",6,4
joey,"Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kind of….",6,4
chandler,"""Benefits lapsed.""",6,4
joey,Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.,6,4
chandler,"Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.",6,4
joey,Let me see that!,6,4
chandler,All right.,6,4
joey,"Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, you know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I got to be careful?!",6,4
chandler,"I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.",6,4
joey,"All right well, I guess I got to go get a job. I’m going to go see my agent.",6,4
chandler,"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.",6,4
joey,look both ways before you cross the street.,6,4
phoebe,Hey!,6,4
rachel,"Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?",6,4
phoebe,"Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. OH, by the way, do you think you could—",6,4
rachel,"Pheebs, what-what are you doing?",6,4
phoebe,I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?,6,4
rachel,"Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?",6,4
phoebe,"Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favour? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, you know if you can.",6,4
rachel,Monica!,6,4
monica,Hmm?,6,4
rachel,Did-did you take these back?,6,4
monica,"No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.",6,4
rachel,"Oh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they?",6,4
monica,I loved them!,6,4
rachel,Yeah.  Nice try!,6,4
ross,Hello!,6,4
monica,Hey!,6,4
rachel,Hey!,6,4
monica,How’d the lecture go?,6,4
ross,It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!,6,4
rachel,"Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.",6,4
ross,"I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, ""Ross you have to be funny and sexy."" Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m going to pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.",6,4
monica,That you’re not funny or sexy?,6,4
ross,That’s right!,6,4
joey,"Hey Estelle, listen",6,4
estelle,Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!,6,4
joey,What are you talking’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been my agent!,6,4
estelle,Really?!,6,4
joey,Yeah!,6,4
estelle,"Oh well, no harm, no foul.",6,4
joey,"Estelle, you got to get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.",6,4
estelle,"All right, first thing we got to do, damage control.",6,4
joey,Why?,6,4
estelle,"Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.",6,4
joey,Bastard!,6,4
chandler,Hey!,6,4
joey,Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time.,6,4
chandler,"That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?",6,4
joey,What?!,6,4
chandler,What’s wrong with you?,6,4
joey,"Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",6,4
chandler,This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!,6,4
joey,"No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s going to be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!",6,4
chandler,That’s a hernia.,6,4
joey,Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!,6,4
rachel,"Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes.",6,4
monica,"Yeah, but you know we could sneak in and watch.",6,4
rachel,"Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa.  Hey sisters!   Wow, we really are bitches.",6,4
ross,"Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when— Oh bloody hell.",6,4
monica,What the hell are you doing?!,6,4
ross,"Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.",6,4
rachel,"Yeah, and not a very good one.",6,4
ross,Will you-will you please?,6,4
the professor,"Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I’m a professor in the palaeontology department here.",6,4
ross,Oh.,6,4
the professor,Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?,6,4
ross,"I’m sorry, I’ve got plans with my sister.",6,4
monica,Monica Geller.,6,4
ross,"Right, will you excuse us for one moment?   What are you doing?",6,4
monica,"Oh, you can have an accent and I can’t?!  Top ‘O the morning to you laddies!",6,4
ross,Just please stop!,6,4
rachel,"Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.",6,4
chandler,"Hey, will you grab me a cruller?  Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!",6,4
joey,"Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.",6,4
chandler,I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.,6,4
joey,"Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.",6,4
phoebe,Hey!,6,4
chandler,Hey.,6,4
joey,Hey!,6,4
phoebe,What’s going on?,6,4
chandler,"Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!",6,4
joey,"Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here  it doesn’t hurt that bad.",6,4
phoebe,Hey! Maybe you’ll die!,6,4
joey,"Sure, now I’m scared.",6,4
phoebe,"No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? Because I’m out of here sometime before Friday.",6,4
joey,"Yeah, but I don’t want to die!",6,4
phoebe,"No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!",6,4
monica,give me ‘them!,6,4
rachel,No! They are mine!,6,4
monica,You stole them from me!,6,4
rachel,You stole them from me!!,6,4
monica,give me them!,6,4
monica,You just want to each take one?,6,4
rachel,Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,6,4
ross,"Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?",6,4
rachel,Well,6,4
monica,"Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, you know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",6,4
rachel,"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",6,4
ross,They’re not listening too me?,6,4
rachel,Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,6,4
ross,Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?,6,4
monica,I think you look fine.,6,4

russell,"Yes, this Russell, Ross’s divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven’t heard from him, I assume he’s decided to give the marriage a try.",6,4
rachel,Ross got married again—No!!!!!!!!!,6,4
ross,"All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory  the team would never have identified  the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point?  Yes.",6,4
a student,What’s happening to your accent?,6,4
ross,"Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense?   All right, I’m-I’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I’m sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions?  About palaeontology.  All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression",6,4
rachel,"Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never going to tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!",6,4

phoebe,Oh my God!!,6,5
monica,Ross!,6,5
ross,"Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage.",6,5
chandler,"Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?",6,5
ross,"Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kind of funny.  Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it.",6,5
phoebe,"Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!",6,5
ross,"Phoebe, I told her you already knew.",6,5
phoebe,Another lie. You have a sickness!,6,5
chandler,"Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to anymore of us are you?",6,5

chandler,"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.",6,5
joey,Great! Thanks.,6,5
phoebe,"Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!",6,5

chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?,6,5

phoebe,"What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don’t have a roommate.",6,5
rachel,"Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.",6,5
phoebe,Maybe you could be my roommate!,6,5
rachel,Well there’s an idea!!,6,5
phoebe,Yeah!,6,5
rachel,"That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?",6,5

rachel,"Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.",6,5
ross,"Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2",6,5
rachel,"Well sure, if you say you’re going to take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms!  All right, now I’m going to do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you!",6,5
ross,"Okay Rach, but",6,5
rachel,Op! You’re peeping!,6,5
rachel,"Ross! you know what, I just got—why? Why did you do this?!",6,5
ross,Look I told you,6,5
rachel,"I don’t want to hear ""Three failed marriages!""",6,5
ross,"Look, if you’d had two failed marriages, you’d understand!",6,5
rachel,"Well, you know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry!",6,5
ross,What about the time I said we were on a break?,6,5
rachel,Ugh!,6,5
monica,"Pheebs, how’s it going?",6,5
phoebe,I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?,6,5
monica,"Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.",6,5
chandler,"Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben.  Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there, we kind of have a situation over here too.",6,5
phoebe,"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",6,5
chandler,See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defence.,6,5
monica,What do you mean?,6,5
chandler,"I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And you know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around",6,5
phoebe,"That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.",6,5
chandler,"Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.",6,5
monica,This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.,6,5
phoebe,Yeah?  Well this is not what I ordered.,6,5
joey,Hey guys!,6,5
chandler,Hey!,6,5
phoebe,Hey!,6,5
joey,"Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I’ve got the keys too, still there!",6,5
chandler,Shocking! Since you still have the keys.,6,5
joey,"You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are friendly; they-they want to talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.",6,5
chandler,What equity investments?,6,5
joey,"The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up!  But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re going to start to think that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?",6,5
monica,"Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.",6,5
chandler,You don’t even have a car!,6,5
monica,"I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.",6,5
chandler,And?,6,5
monica,And six others.,6,5
chandler,There you are.,6,5
joey,"Yeah, she tops out at 130.",6,5
guy #2,Wow!,6,5
joey,And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.,6,5
guy #2,Really! You got a place upstate?,6,5
joey,Sure!,6,5
guy #2,"Well, I’ll see you later.",6,5
joey,"Okay, take it easy.",6,5
the porsche owner,Hey! That’s my car.,6,5
joey,"Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.",6,5
the porsche owner,What-what are you doing?,6,5
joey,"Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up.",6,5
the porsche owner,But it’s my car!,6,5
joey,"Yeah, but it’s my wax.",6,5
the porsche owner,"Listen, I-I-I don’t come to this city much so I don’t know if you’re crazy or this is some kind of street theatre, but could I have my keys.",6,5
joey,"Sure. Here.  I’ll uh, save your parking spot.",6,5
the porsche owner,I’m not coming back.,6,5
joey,Why not?,6,5
the porsche owner,I live upstate.,6,5
joey,"Yeah, so did I.",6,5
phoebe,I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.,6,5
monica,"Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same.",6,5
chandler,"Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!",6,5
monica,"Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!",6,5
chandler,He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!,6,5
phoebe,"No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just going to mess them up.",6,5
chandler,"They’re not going to swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!",6,5
phoebe,What?!,6,5
chandler,"Glass, sand, whatever.",6,5
phoebe,"Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.",6,5
monica,Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.,6,5
phoebe,"Oh, I can still do that.",6,5
monica,How are you still single?!,6,5
chandler,All right.  I thought about it and maybe you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.,6,5
monica,Good. What made you change your mind?,6,5
chandler,I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.,6,5
phoebe,How did that happen?!!,6,5
chandler,"Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. you know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat.",6,5
monica,"Damnit! you know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!",6,5
judge,Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,6,5
rachel,"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",6,5
judge,So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,6,5
ross,"Fine, I’m mentally unstable.",6,5
judge,And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,6,5
ross,What?!,6,5
rachel,"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",6,5
ross,Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!,6,5
rachel,"Well, you would know.",6,5
judge,Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,6,5
ross,"Oh, come on!",6,5
rachel,"Ross, please, I found the magazines!",6,5
judge,"And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin.",6,5
ross,"Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!",6,5
judge,That won’t be necessary.,6,5
ross,And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!,6,5
rachel,Ugh!,6,5
judge,"Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.",6,5
rachel,"Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!  And could you strike ""Consummated like bunnies"" from the record?",6,5
judge,"Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?",6,5
rachel,"Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.",6,5
judge,"Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce.",6,5
ross,"That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!",6,5
rachel,What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!,6,5
ross,And what——What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’t type that! What?! Stop typing!  Hey! Stop typing!  Stop typing! Stop typing!!,6,5
rachel,"Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping me married too?!",6,5
judge,You need to get out of my chambers.,6,5
rachel,"All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!",6,5
ross,Yeah!,6,5
judge,Would you like to spend the night in jail?,6,5
rachel,And thank you for your time.,6,5
joey,So the Porsche guy took his car back.,6,5
chandler,But you found the keys to his clothes?,6,5
joey,"No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.",6,5
monica,And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes?,6,5
joey,Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?,6,5
chandler,That is true.,6,5
phoebe,"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.",6,5
joey,"Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am going to go drive my Porsche.",6,5
monica,"Joey, you know you don’t actually have one.",6,5
joey,Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!,6,5
chandler,"Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.",6,5
monica,"All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.",6,5
phoebe,"What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!",6,5
monica,"The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while!",6,5
phoebe,But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re going to triple team me!,6,5
monica,"He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital.",6,5
phoebe,"But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just going to you know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",6,5
chandler,I think that’s gum.,6,5
phoebe,I’m pretty sure it’s gun.,6,5
chandler,"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.",6,5
phoebe,"A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?",6,5
joey,Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?,6,5
passerby,Maybe because you’ve got the keys?,6,5
joey,Porsche.,6,5
rachel,This is totally your fault!,6,5
ross,My fault?! You threatened the judge!,6,5
rachel,"Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!",6,5
ross,That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!,6,5
joey,Hi! How are the Gellers?,6,5
rachel,Don’t call us that!,6,5
ross,The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we got to get a divorce!! Did a Porsche throw up on you?,6,5
joey,Hey! It’s Porsche!!,6,5
phoebe,"Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I’m going to take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!"" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one.  Okay, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? Because let’s face it, we’re at Monica’s.  I broke it. All right. Well, that’s just the way that goes.  Okay, good.  Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can’t answer.  Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words!  Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh!  Oh, you’re a lot mischievous! Well, it’ll dry.   Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now—who aren’t there!",6,5
chandler,Hey!,6,5
phoebe,How do you feel?,6,5
chandler,"Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.",6,5
phoebe,"Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘them, bathed ‘them, and put ‘them to bed.",6,5
chandler,And protected them from a tornado?,6,5
monica,Oh my God.,6,5
phoebe,"I know, the babies are asleep.",6,5
monica,"Phoebe, what, what happened here?!",6,5
phoebe,I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!,6,5
monica,But my apartment!,6,5
chandler,Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.,6,5
monica,But the mess!,6,5
chandler,Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.,6,5
monica,"You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out. Because this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!",6,5
chandler,"Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",6,5
rachel,"Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried.",6,5
ross,"I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign.",6,5
rachel,"Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!",6,5
ross,"you know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?",6,5
rachel,"Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!",6,5
ross,"Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!",6,5
rachel,Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!,6,5
ross,Yeah! Right!,6,5
ross,"You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s, let’s just sign the papers. All right?  What?",6,5
rachel,Nothing.,6,5
ross,"Okay, can we just sign please?",6,5
rachel,Uh-hmm.,6,5
ross,Congratulations.,6,5
rachel,"Okay Ross, we’re—wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kind of have a little confession.",6,5
ross,What?,6,5
rachel,"Well, you know this whole marriage thing, kind of my idea.",6,5
ross,Excuse me?,6,5
rachel,"Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?",6,5
ross,Yeah?,6,5
rachel,"And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything, but it kind of it just, it kind of kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.",6,5
ross,"So then if-if—I mean if you think about it, this is all  your fault.",6,5
rachel,"Yeah, don’t push it though.",6,5
ross,"I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.",6,5
rachel,"I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.",6,5
ross,"Did I, did I even treat?",6,5
rachel,"No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.",6,5
ross,That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.,6,5
rachel,"Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.",6,5
ross,"Eh, no problem.",6,5
rachel,I’m going to need a copy of those.,6,5
ross,Totally.,6,5
joey,Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!,6,5
woman,Hi Joey.,6,5
joey,Hey! How you doin’?,6,5
woman,He has the most amazing Porsche under there!,6,5
joey,"I’d love to show you, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.  Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?",6,5
chandler,"Okay!  Listen, I’m going to be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.",6,6
joey,Right! And when is that due?,6,6
chandler,First of the month.,6,6
joey,And that’s every month?,6,6
chandler,"No, just the months you actually want to live here.",6,6
joey,Ah.,6,6
chandler,"Okay, here is the phone bill.",6,6
joey,Oh my God!!,6,6
chandler,"That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kind of sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?",6,6
joey,No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.,6,6
chandler,"It’s not charity, Joe",6,6
joey,"No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on.",6,6
chandler,"Okay uh, here’s the electric bill.",6,6
joey,This is how much we pay for electric?!!!,6,6
chandler,"Uh, yeah.",6,6
chandler,"So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?",6,6
phoebe,So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?,6,6
chandler,"No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.",6,6
phoebe,"Well, how much do you think he needs?",6,6
chandler,"I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, you know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.",6,6
phoebe,Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.,6,6
chandler,Well that would help the pride thing.,6,6
monica,Hey!,6,6
chandler,Hey! Wow! You look great! want to move in with me tomorrow?,6,6
monica,Okay.,6,6
chandler,"Okay!  So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?",6,6
monica,"Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.",6,6
phoebe,"And also, my birthday.",6,6
monica,It’s not your birthday.,6,6
phoebe,What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!,6,6
joey,Hey!,6,6
ross,Hey!,6,6
chandler,Hey!,6,6
phoebe,Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?,6,6
chandler,"Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.",6,6
ross,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.",6,6
joey,"I don’t know Ross, not if you’re going to talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a palaeontologist.",6,6
ross,I did give up a career in basketball to become a palaeontologist!,6,6
rachel,"Pheebs, I was wondering",6,6
monica,You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!,6,6
rachel,Well and clearly not a minute sooner.,6,6
monica,"Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you’re packed.",6,6
rachel,Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.,6,6
phoebe,"My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.",6,6
phoebe,Oh my God! Monica’s just going to kill you.,6,6
rachel,"Yeah, yeah, I know.",6,6
phoebe,"Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.",6,6
monica,"Rachel, I need to borrow—You’re not packed!!!! You’re not packed even a little bit!",6,6
rachel,Surprise!!,6,6
monica,What?,6,6
rachel,"No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, ""What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!"" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!",6,6
monica,"I’ll be coordinator! Oh my God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?",6,6
phoebe,I have plans.,6,6
monica,You’re plans were with us.,6,6
phoebe,That’s right.,6,6
monica,"All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!",6,6
phoebe,Okay.,6,6
monica,"Okay!  Oh my God, thank you!!",6,6
phoebe,"Hurry! Monica’s going to make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves!",6,6
monica,"Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we’re going to start with",6,6
chandler,"Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.",6,6
monica,I thought you said you were going to do nothing.,6,6
chandler,"Yes, but for the last time.",6,6
monica,"Okay fine, now Ross",6,6
ross,"Oh, but-but I can’t do it.",6,6
monica,Why not?,6,6
joey,I’ve got Ben.,6,6
ross,"Because, because I’ve got Ben.",6,6
monica,"It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?",6,6
chandler,He’s at a dinner party.,6,6
monica,Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!,6,6
ross,"Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?",6,6
monica,"All right, sorry.",6,6
ross,I got to go make a fake Ben.,6,6
joey,Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.,6,6
chandler,"Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.",6,6
joey,"Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kind of nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!",6,6
chandler,"Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?",6,6
joey,"What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.",6,6
chandler,Yes it would. What do you say to $50?,6,6
joey,"Okay, you’re on.",6,6
chandler,"Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.",6,6
rachel,"oh, look it’s the roller blades.",6,6
monica,Oh God!,6,6
rachel,You remember when we got these?,6,6
monica,No.,6,6
rachel,I guess you weren’t there.,6,6
phoebe,"You guys, we said we were going to have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time…  You don’t remember?",6,6
rachel,"I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.",6,6
monica,I’m going to miss you so much.,6,6
phoebe,"Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. you know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re going to miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not going to miss.",6,6
monica,I don’t think there’s anything.,6,6
phoebe,"Come on, there’s got to be something.",6,6
monica,"Nope, she’s perfect.",6,6
rachel,I have one.,6,6
phoebe,Good! Great! You can go first.,6,6
rachel,"Uh well, I guess I’m not going to miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen.",6,6
phoebe,"Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? you know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?",6,6
monica,"Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.",6,6
phoebe,"Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?",6,6
monica,Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.,6,6
rachel,You get your messages!,6,6
monica,"Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.",6,6
rachel,"So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?",6,6
phoebe,Great! It worked! No one’s sad.,6,6
joey,Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That’s like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo!  $500 that is a lot of electricity!  Whoo-ho-ho!  I got to buy some food.,6,6
chandler,"Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.",6,6
joey,You serious?,6,6
chandler,Oh yes!,6,6
joey,"Okay, get ready to owe me!",6,6
chandler,Okay.,6,6
joey,"Okay, here we go. Ready?",6,6
chandler,No! No! No! No——one can beat me.,6,6
chandler,"See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.",6,6
monica,"Hello?  Oh, hi Ross!  See? Other people call me!",6,6
rachel,"Ooh, your brother. Score!",6,6
monica,What’s up?,6,6
ross,"Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.",6,6
monica,"Oh, put him on!",6,6
ross,"Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.  Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.",6,6
phoebe,"Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?",6,6
rachel,"You know what else I’m not going to miss? ""I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!""",6,6
monica,"""Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!""",6,6
rachel,"""I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!""",6,6
phoebe,Hey! I call her!,6,6
monica,"""Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!""",6,6
rachel,"""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!""",6,6
phoebe,"Yeah, we should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations.",6,6
chandler,Still broken?,6,6
joey,"This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.",6,6
chandler,"Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?",6,6
joey,"Nah, not my game.",6,6
chandler,"Okay, uh, how about, how about—you know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun.",6,6
joey,"Well, what’s it called?",6,6
chandler,Cups.,6,6
joey,I don’t know how to play Cups.,6,6
chandler,"I’ll teach you! Come on, come on, it’s really easy and really, really fun.",6,6
joey,All right.,6,6
chandler,"Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?",6,6
joey,A two and a five.,6,6
chandler,"Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!",6,6
joey,Really?!,6,6
chandler,"Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again.  What do you got?",6,6
joey,A four and a nine.,6,6
chandler,You’re kidding right?,6,6
joey,No. Why?,6,6
chandler,Well that’s a full cup!,6,6
joey,Damn! I am good at Cups!,6,6
monica,I’m not talking to her!,6,6
phoebe,"Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!",6,6
monica,"Well, maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!",6,6
phoebe,"I know, I took it hard too.",6,6
monica,"Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about—What are you doing?",6,6
rachel,I’m unpacking!,6,6
monica,What?!,6,6
rachel,I’m not moving!  Is that picture straight?,6,6
monica,It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!,6,6
rachel,"Hey, you know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!",6,6
monica,Because it’s my apartment!,6,6
rachel,Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!,6,6
monica,"How about, you’re moving!!",6,6
rachel,Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!,6,6
phoebe,"Hey, how are you guys doing?",6,6
rachel,Great! Monica’s moving!,6,6
monica,I am not!,6,6
rachel,Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!,6,6
phoebe,"Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay, you guys… STOP!!  I know that, I know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down.",6,6
monica,No Phoebe I am mad!,6,6
phoebe,"Well, deep-deep-deep down!",6,6
rachel,"Yeah, I’m just mad!",6,6
phoebe,Then keep running.,6,6
chandler,You win.,6,6
joey,"Well, what did you have?",6,6
chandler,"It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?",6,6
joey,"Uh,  wow, 700.",6,6
chandler,Not 700 exactly?,6,6
joey,Yeah.,6,6
chandler,Double it!,6,6
joey,What?,6,6
chandler,"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.",6,6
joey,Really?,6,6
chandler,"Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.  Don’t get to excited because that’s not going to happen unless you get—No way!",6,6
monica,"Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just going to label it, ""What were you thinking?""",6,6
rachel,"Funny, because I was just going to go across the hall and write that on Chandler.",6,6
phoebe,"Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.",6,6
monica and rachel,What?!,6,6
phoebe,You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!,6,6
rachel,"Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.",6,6
monica,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you got to take her! you know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but you know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.",6,6
rachel,Oh really? Like what Monica?,6,6
monica,"you know she has 147,000 pairs of boots",6,6
rachel,"Oh yeah, good start Mon.",6,6
monica,She lets you borrow them.,6,6
rachel,Yeah and you stretch ‘them out with your big old clown feet.,6,6
monica,"Do you want to live outside?! Because it’s getting’ cold!  She gets tons of catalogues and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.",6,6
phoebe,What else?,6,6
monica,"When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.",6,6
rachel,"Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.",6,6
phoebe,That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.,6,6
monica,"When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.",6,6
rachel,"Well you know, I don’t want you to be cold.",6,6
monica,"And when I told her that I was going to be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.   You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!",6,6
rachel,"Oh, it’s going to be fine.",6,6
phoebe,"Okay Rachel, I can’t wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have so much fun!!",6,6
rachel,"But honey, I think she’s moving in with Chandler.",6,6
phoebe,Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?,6,6
monica,kind of.  Oh my God!,6,6
ross,"Hello?  Hey Mon, how’s the packing going?  Ben? He’s fine. Yeah, he’s right—Oh my God!  Get your head of your shirt there son!  What?  Yeah, it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack.",6,6
joey,Hey!,6,6
chandler,What’s wrong?,6,6
joey,"Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!",6,6
chandler,Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!,6,6
joey,"The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sitting’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t even get half a cup! Nothing’!!",6,6
chandler,Oh man!!,6,6
joey,"And he never played before either! you know what I think? I think beginner’s luck, very important in Cups.",6,6
chandler,"All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!",6,6
joey,"No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time! In-in fact, look, there’s a—I want to give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money.  Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kind of of a, you know, thank you for being such a great roommate.",6,6
chandler,I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!,6,6
joey,"It’s him, not it!",6,6
chandler,"No, but wait—what if I bought it from you, you know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500?",6,6
joey,"Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re trying to give me money again!",6,6
chandler,When did I try to give you money?,6,6
joey,"Over there!  Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said ""No,"" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!",6,6
chandler,I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I want to make sure that you’re okay.,6,6
joey,"I will be okay! Look Chandler, you got to get it out of your head that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I’m not going to miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I’m going to miss…is you. And now the dog.",6,6
monica,Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?,6,6
rachel,Okay.,6,6
monica,I’m really going to miss you.,6,6
rachel,Oh! I have your key. Here you go.,6,6
monica,Thanks.,6,6
rachel,Yeah.,6,6
rachel,"Oh God! This is silly, I’m going to see you in a couple of hours!",6,6
monica,Yeah.,6,6
rachel,Bye house!,6,6
rachel,Bye Mon.,6,6
monica,Bye.,6,6
chandler,Hey.,6,6
monica,She really left.,6,6
chandler,I know.,6,6
monica,Thank you.,6,6
chandler,No problem roomie.,6,6
monica,Can I ask you a question?,6,6
chandler,Sure!,6,6
monica,What the hell is that dog doing here?!,6,6
chandler,I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.,6,6
ross,And now you want that money back.,6,6
chandler,Exactly.,6,6
ross,"Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?",6,6
chandler,It’s not a real game! I made it up!,6,6
ross,"I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.",6,6
chandler,At a fake game!!,6,6
ross,"Now, if you want to try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.",6,6
chandler,Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.,6,6
ross,No.,6,6
chandler,"Hmm, let’s see if it comes up this time.",6,6
phoebe,Ready?,6,7
rachel,Yeah.,6,7
phoebe,Okay.,6,7

rachel,"Wait, I-I just said ""leave.""",6,7
phoebe,"Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get ""it’s,"" ""and"" oh I'm sorry, I have ""A."" Forget it.",6,7
rachel,"Phoebe, come on that is silly.",6,7

rachel,"No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.",6,7

rachel,What?,6,7
phoebe,"Oh, you are no ordinary roommate are you?",6,7
rachel,"Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I want to go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!",6,7
phoebe,Really?,6,7
rachel,"Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first you know roommate bonding thing.",6,7
phoebe,"Okay, let's go running!",6,7
rachel,Yeah and there's really cute guys there.,6,7

rachel,Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!,6,7
phoebe,Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.,6,7
ross,"So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.",6,7
chandler,And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.,6,7
monica,Hey!,6,7
ross and chandler,Hey!,6,7
monica,"Honey, that is a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!",6,7
chandler,I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.,6,7
monica,"Oh, So you can move them!",6,7
chandler,"Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.",6,7
joey,"Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's going to be my new roommate!",6,7
janine,Hi.,6,7

janine,Hi,6,7
joey,"Yeah, she's going to live with me!",6,7
monica,It's nice to meet you. Janine...?,6,7
janine,Lecroix. Janine Lecroix,6,7
joey,"I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!",6,7
chandler,"So, uh, wh-where you from?",6,7
janine,"Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.",6,7
joey,From the land down under? I didn't know that either!,6,7
ross,"So uh, what-uh, what do you do?",6,7
janine,I'm a dancer.,6,7
joey,you are a dancer? She-she's a dancer!,6,7
janine,"Well, I think I'll go and unpack.",6,7
joey,"Oh, hey let me.",6,7
monica,"Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?",6,7
joey,Of course I did.,6,7
monica,"Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?",6,7
joey,"""When can you move in?""",6,7
ross,Thank you for bringing her into our lives.,6,7
chandler,Unbelievable,6,7
monica,"Oh, so you like her too Chandler?",6,7
chandler,"Hey, look at all the boxes!",6,7
joey,"Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!",6,7
monica,"Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.",6,7
ross,"Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.",6,7
chandler,"All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?",6,7
joey,"Oh God, yeah.",6,7
chandler,Now imagine you live at the supermarket.,6,7
joey,Okay!,6,7
chandler,No-no,6,7
joey,"Oh, Oh, you are right! I don't want that. I can't date her!",6,7
monica,"Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.",6,7
joey,"Well, that is going to be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.",6,7
monica,"Hmm, well you are around me all the time and you don't flirt.",6,7
joey,You a little sad about that sweetheart?,6,7
phoebe,"I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.",6,7
rachel,Okay.,6,7
phoebe,Okay.  Come on! that is not running! Let's go!,6,7
rachel,"You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.",6,7
ross,"Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.",6,7
rachel,Oh! I used to do that too!,6,7
monica,"Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?",6,7
rachel,"Aw, Mon...",6,7
monica,"So, Phoebe runs weird huh?",6,7
rachel,"Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's going to want to run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.",6,7
monica,Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.,6,7
ross,Yeah.,6,7
rachel,"you are right, you are right. I should just tell her the truth.",6,7
phoebe,Hey!,6,7
ross,Hey!,6,7
rachel,"Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!",6,7
phoebe,Why? Why would you do that?,6,7
monica,I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.,6,7
rachel,Ankle.,6,7
monica,We'll see.,6,7
chandler,"OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man.  Joe?  Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.",6,7
joey,I Gotcha!!,6,7
chandler,Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.,6,7
joey,"Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell you. Hey, hey, the place looks great!",6,7
chandler,"Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica’s going to be working late, so I'm going to make this place spotless. You know what else I'm going to do, know what else I'm going to do? I'm going to go downstairs, I'm going to get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't want to live with me?",6,7
joey,"I don't! No, I want to live with the super-hot Australian dancer.",6,7
chandler,"Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?",6,7
joey,"Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it.  How you doin?",6,7
joey,oh man,6,7
janine,"Sorry, there's just more room out here.",6,7
joey,"No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.",6,7
janine,Why don't you try to do-,6,7
joey,,6,7
janine,What's wrong?,6,7
joey,Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower.  Oh my God!,6,7
janine,"Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.",6,7
phoebe,"Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.",6,7
rachel,"No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!",6,7
phoebe,"Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.",6,7
rachel,"No, wait Phoebe.",6,7
ross,"Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what are you doing?",6,7
chandler,What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!,6,7
ross,Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?,6,7
chandler,Authorization? I don't need that. I'm going to put everything back.,6,7
ross,Put it back exactly where you found it?,6,7
chandler,Yes I'm going to put it back  exactly where I found it.,6,7
ross,"‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.",6,7
chandler,She's not going to care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.,6,7
ross,"Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?",6,7
chandler,"She is going to recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.",6,7
ross,"Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.",6,7
chandler,"I see, I see, y-y-you are trying to freak me out.",6,7
ross,"Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.",6,7
chandler,"No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm going to call her right now.  Phone's done eh.",6,7
monica,Hi!,6,7
chandler,"Hey Mon, how's it going?",6,7
monica,"Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.",6,7
chandler,"Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.",6,7
monica,It's worse. The only thing that is getting me through is knowing that I'm going to be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.,6,7
chandler,No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.,6,7
monica,"Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?",6,7
chandler,"It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's going to kill me.",6,7
ross,"Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.",6,7
chandler,"We should start with the big stuff. you know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch.  I got it.",6,7
ross,"Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.",6,7
chandler,"What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.",6,7
ross,"Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.",6,7
chandler,"OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.",6,7
ross,"Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be cantered in the seating area.",6,7
chandler,"Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the… Ross!!!!",6,7
joey,"Look, what am I going to do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame!  What the hell's going on over here?!?!?  Monica's going to kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.",6,7
ross,"Hey, I've been married 3 times",6,7
joey,"No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?",6,7
ross,"Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.",6,7
chandler,"Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?",6,7
ross,"Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go ""ba dum bum chessh""",6,7
chandler,"Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.",6,7
ross,"OH you know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.",6,7
chandler,that is not specific to girls.,6,7
joey,"This is great, this is great, what else, what else?",6,7
ross,"Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.",6,7
chandler,And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.,6,7
ross,They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.,6,7
chandler,"Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.",6,7
ross,I'm never going to find love again.,6,7
rachel,"Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?",6,7
phoebe,Sure,6,7
rachel,"Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.",6,7
phoebe,"So, what should you have done?",6,7
rachel,"Well, I-I should've told you the truth.",6,7
phoebe,"Uh-Huh, Which is...?",6,7
rachel,"Well, you know, the reason I didn't want to go running with you is because um, well you know the way that you run is a little...",6,7
phoebe,So?,6,7
rachel,"Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.",6,7
phoebe,Why do you care?,6,7
rachel,Because they're people.,6,7
phoebe,But people that you don't know and will never see again.,6,7
rachel,"Yes, but still. They're people…with eyes.",6,7
phoebe,"Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. you are uptight.",6,7
rachel,"I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.",6,7
phoebe,"that is okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that is just who you are. Me. I'm more free you know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that is the only way it's fun. You know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were going to fall off? You know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan?  The neighbour's dog.",6,7
chandler,"Okay, is this lamp in the same place?",6,7
ross,Who cares? I repel women.,6,7
chandler,No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.,6,7
monica,What?!,6,7
ross,What?!,6,7
chandler,I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.,6,7
ross,Why does anyone have to be naked?,6,7
monica,Why is Ross naked?,6,7
ross,I-I had to show Chandler something?,6,7
monica,Naked?,6,7
ross,"Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.",6,7
monica,Is it the same thing that Chandler had?,6,7
chandler,"Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.",6,7
monica,"Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!",6,7
chandler,Bye! Thank God,6,7
ross,"Dude, what'd you have?",6,7
chandler,"Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We got to get everything back into its original place.",6,7
ross,The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.,6,7
chandler,that is perfect! that is brilliant!,6,7
ross,"So really, what'd you have?",6,7
janine,"Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.",6,7
joey,"Uh, don't you mean ""for whom?""",6,7
janine,"Sure, listen I was going to order some pizza, you want to share one?",6,7
joey,"Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.",6,7
janine,Is there something wrong?,6,7
joey,"All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? you are hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.",6,7
janine,Joey...,6,7
joey,"No, no, no, I'm telling you. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?",6,7
janine,"Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you are really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.",6,7
joey,Oh!,6,7
janine,"No! I mean you are a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just you know, I just don't feel that way about you.",6,7
joey,"Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.",6,7
janine,I don't think so.,6,7
joey,"Oh, I do.  How you doin?",6,7
janine,I'm OK,6,7
joey,What?!?!,6,7

joey,Oh dear God!,6,7

rachel,"Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!",6,7
phoebe,"See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you are gone!",6,7
rachel,Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful.  Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!,6,7
monica,Is it okay for me to come in now?,6,7
chandler,Uh-huh,6,7
monica,Why is everything different?,6,7
ross,Bye!,6,7
chandler,"No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.",6,7
monica,"Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.",6,7
chandler,"Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",6,7
monica,"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",6,7
chandler,Do you want me to be afraid of you?,6,7
monica,"Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.",6,7
chandler,Really?,6,7
monica,Of course!,6,7
chandler,Oh well you are the best. You come here to me.,6,7
monica,"All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?",6,7
ross,"So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...",6,7
janine,...and live forever as a machine!,6,7
ross,"that is so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.",6,7
janine,"Yeah, I got to go.",6,7
chandler,Ba dum bumb cheshhh!,6,7
joey,Hey.,6,8
chandler,"Hi, my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?",6,8
joey,"Sure, neighbour come on in.",6,8
chandler,"So, is Janine around?",6,8
joey,"Uh, no, she’s at dance class.",6,8
chandler,Can I check out what she did to my room?,6,8
joey,"Yeah, but, hey look, don’t go through her stuff. She gets really mad.",6,8
chandler,"Oh my God. What is th… it’s like a guy never lived in here. Look, you’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous.  It’s spreading already.",6,8
joey,It is???,6,8
chandler,"Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?",6,8
joey,No.,6,8
chandler,"Is that your tiny little box, that’s too small to put anything in?",6,8
joey,No.,6,8
chandler,"No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.",6,8
joey,"All right, you’re right. I’ll talk to her.",6,8
chandler,Yes talk to her. Be a man.,6,8
joey,I’m a man.,6,8
chandler,Defend yourself.,6,8
joey,Hmm.,6,8
monica,Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.,6,8
chandler,Be right there sweetums.  A totally different situation.,6,8
monica,Hey guys.,6,8
chandler,"Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?",6,8
monica,It was okay. She’s still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.,6,8
chandler,"OH, yeah.",6,8
ross,"Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?",6,8
monica,Yeah.,6,8
ross,The one that always stares at me when I come in?,6,8
monica,"No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.",6,8
ross,"Still I could tell. She was into me.  Well, why don’t you set us up?",6,8
rachel,"OH, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?",6,8
phoebe,Hey.,6,8
rachel,Hey.,6,8
phoebe,Rachel?,6,8
rachel,Yeah.,6,8
phoebe,"I’m, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine.",6,8
rachel,"Well, sure, but they might think it’s kind of weird considering I don’t work there anymore.",6,8
phoebe,Oh my God. What happened?,6,8
rachel,"I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.",6,8
phoebe,Well that’s great! Congratulations!!,6,8
rachel,Yeah.  A year ago..,6,8
phoebe,You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you.,6,8
rachel,"But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.",6,8
chandler,That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.,6,8
monica,I don’t think mine likes me either.,6,8
ross,Maybe it’s a universal thing?,6,8
joey,"Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11",6,8
chandler,Yeah let’s head off to work.,6,8
monica,We should go.,6,8
phoebe,Thank you.,6,8
rachel,Sure.,6,8
phoebe,"Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.",6,8
rachel,Oh my God. Did you talk to him?,6,8
phoebe,Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.,6,8
rachel,What? What!?! You kissed him?,6,8
phoebe,Totally.,6,8
rachel,Phoebe are you serious?,6,8
phoebe,"Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we’re making out. You know.",6,8
rachel,"Phoebe, I mean, you do know he’s married?",6,8
phoebe,No!,6,8
rachel,Phoebe,6,8
phoebe,"What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he’s married?  No, yeah, I should.",6,8
janine,Hey Joey.,6,8
joey,"Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?",6,8
janine,"No, I just thought it was cute.",6,8
joey,"Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh…Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It’s…too girly.",6,8
janine,OH. Like what?,6,8
joey,Like this.  Pictures of cute babies we don’t know. We. We can’t have that.,6,8
janine,"Joey, it’s Anne Geddes. She’s a famous artist.",6,8
joey,"Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here.",6,8
janine,"Well, I’m sorry. I just thought I’d try to make the place a little nicer.",6,8
joey,"Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.",6,8
janine,Well I just thought,6,8
joey,"I’m sure it’s a famous watering can, okay. But, come on…and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?",6,8
janine,It’s a curling iron.,6,8
joey,"OH, well, that’s ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It’s up here on some hook. And…smells different.",6,8
janine,It’s clean.,6,8
joey,"Yeah, well, it feels different.",6,8
janine,It’s dry.,6,8
joey,"Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels…Also what is with these chips you bought?",6,8
janine,"No no no no, it’s potpourri. You’re supposed to smell it.",6,8
joey,Well that’s like summer in a bowl.,6,8
rachel,"Oh, Kim, Hi.",6,8
kim,Uhh-huh.,6,8
rachel,"So you know, I…I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.",6,8
kim,I didn’t read it.,6,8
rachel,"Ahh….So…Wow…The spring line, it’s really going to be great this year, huh?",6,8

chandler,You know…Oh My God.,6,8
monica,What happened to your teeth.,6,8
ross,I whitened them.,6,8
chandler,Really.,6,8
ross,Yeah. What do you think.,6,8
monica,"Well, I think I shouldn’t look directly at them.",6,8
ross,"Come on, seriously.",6,8
monica,"Ross they’re really, really, really white.",6,8
chandler,"Yeah, what was wrong with your old…human teeth.",6,8
ross,"Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.",6,8
monica,How much longer?,6,8
ross,A-A day.,6,8
monica,Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?,6,8
ross,"I know. That’s why I did it.  Come on, are they really that bad?",6,8
chandler,"No, no no no. You’ll be fine.  Hillary’s bind, right?",6,8
monica,She will be after tonight.,6,8
chandler,Yeah.,6,8
ross,"Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything.. ahh",6,8
rachel,"Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside.  You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.",6,8
chandler,What???,6,8
monica,Oh my god.,6,8
rachel,"Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just…made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.",6,8
chandler,I am proud of all my friends today.,6,8
monica,"My God, Rachel, I can’t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. OH, I’m so jealous.",6,8
chandler,"Hi, I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy",6,8
monica,"Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.",6,8
chandler,"Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.",6,8
phoebe,"Hey. Here.  OH, who’s the silver fox?",6,8
rachel,"That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him?  Oh wait. OH, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.",6,8
phoebe,That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.,6,8
rachel,What?,6,8
phoebe,"Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.",6,8
rachel,"Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.",6,8
phoebe,What?,6,8
rachel,"Oh.. Go.. Oh.. and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!",6,8
phoebe,Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?,6,8
rachel,To get you to make out with him!!!,6,8
phoebe,oh.,6,8
monica,"Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white.  Nope. Okay, colours that don’t work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.",6,8
ross,I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour.,6,8
monica,"Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.",6,8
ross,Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.,6,8
monica,"I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.",6,8
ross,Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore.,6,8
monica,Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.,6,8
ross,"But, won’t she notice I have makeup on?",6,8
monica,Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.,6,8
ross,What??,6,8
monica,"All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.",6,8
ross,No. I am not putting on makeup.,6,8
phoebe,Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me?  OH!! Demon!! Demon!!,6,8
monica,Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.,6,8
chandler,"Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.",6,8
monica,"Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.",6,8
chandler,"Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.",6,8
monica,"You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry.",6,8
chandler,"Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.",6,8
monica,Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.,6,8
chandler,You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?,6,8
monica,"When girls hang out, we don’t have pillow fights in our underwear.  I’m sorry. We do. We do. I don’t know why I said that.",6,8
joey,Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.,6,8
chandler,"No thanks, Josephine.",6,8
chandler,"Hey Ross, I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???",6,8
rachel,"OH, hi, Kim.",6,8
kim,Hi Rachel.,6,8
rachel,"Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.",6,8
kim,You didn’t cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?,6,8
rachel,"Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.",6,8
kim,That’s not true?,6,8
rachel,No.,6,8
kim,"Oh that’s interesting? Because I checked and only one key card was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that key card belonged to you, Rachel.",6,8
rachel,"Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.",6,8
kim,Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.,6,8
rachel,I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. OH this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my key card yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my key card.,6,8
kim,Hi Ralph.,6,8
ralph lauren,,6,8
kim,"Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.",6,8
hillary,"And after that, what could I do except become a chef.",6,8
ross,Mmm-Hmm.,6,8
hillary,"And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.",6,8
ross,Mmm.,6,8
hillary,"You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.",6,8
ross,Mm-Hmm.,6,8
hillary,"After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know?",6,8
ross,Hmm-Hmm.,6,8
hillary,I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about you a little bit?,6,8
ross,Mmm-Unmm.,6,8
hillary,Come on. I want to know.,6,8
ross,"Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm.",6,8
joey,"So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.",6,8
monica,"Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.",6,8
chandler,"Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.",6,8
monica,"Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.",6,8
joey,"OH, I love birds.",6,8
chandler,What is the matter with you ?!?,6,8
joey,What?,6,8
chandler,"You’re arranging flowers!  You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!",6,8
joey,"Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.",6,8
chandler,You’re turning into a women.,6,8
joey,No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.,6,8
chandler,Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?,6,8
joey,"It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God, I’m a women!!!",6,8
rachel,"Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.",6,8
phoebe,But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.,6,8
rachel,I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.,6,8
phoebe,"Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?",6,8
rachel,"You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?",6,8
phoebe,Just for a second.,6,8
rachel,"OH, Phoebe, what am I going to do?",6,8
phoebe,"Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.",6,8
rachel,"I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t.",6,8
phoebe,"OH, sleep with Kenny.",6,8
rachel,That wouldn’t help me.,6,8
phoebe,"OH, yes it would.",6,8
hillary,I’ve had a really good time tonight.,6,8
ross,Mmm.,6,8
hillary,"You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.",6,8
ross,"Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Me, neither. I’ve had a really good time too, you know.",6,8
hillary,Are you going to eat that bread?,6,8
ross,"OH, I just like the smell.  Mmm.",6,8
hillary,You make me laugh.,6,8
ross,Hmm-Hmm.,6,8
hillary,Would you like to move over to the couch?,6,8
ross,Mmm-Hmm.,6,8
hillary,Maybe I’ll just turn the lights down a little.,6,8
ross,How about all the way.,6,8
hillary,Okay.,6,8
ross,"Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster?  So, ahh, where were we?",6,8
hillary,Are those your teeth??,6,8
ross,"OH, you can see them, huh?",6,8
hillary,Yes. They’re insanely white.,6,8
ross,"I-I, did that for you.",6,8
hillary,What’s a matter with you?,6,8
ross,What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!,6,8
rachel,"Kim, hi.",6,8
kim,"Hi Rachel. OH, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? OH, what am I thinking. Of course you have.",6,8
rachel,Okay. Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.,6,8
kim,"Oh, really?",6,8
rachel,"Yeah, he dumped me. He said, ""Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry."" And then I don’t know why but he said, ""and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine.""",6,8
kim,You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.,6,8
ralph lauren,,6,8
kim,Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It’s like he hates you. Then it is true.,6,8
rachel,Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.,6,8
kim,OH honey come here.  OH it will be ok. We’ve all been there.,6,8
rachel,You and Ralph?,6,8
kim,Kenny the copyboy.,6,8
janine,Hey.,6,8
joey,"Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.",6,8
janine,What’s the matter? Are you upset?,6,8
joey,"I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be.",6,8
janine,"Well, if that’s what you want. I’ll just put it all in my room.",6,8
joey,"Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know.  You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.",6,8
janine,Okay.,6,8
joey,"And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.",6,8
janine,Sure.,6,8
joey,And a couple of these little tiny boxes.,6,8
janine,Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?,6,8
joey,Okay.,6,8
monica,"Okay, great!  Bye.  So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?",6,9
chandler,Sydney Portier? Heheheh.,6,9
monica,"I miss Rachel.  No, my parents.",6,9
chandler,"Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!",6,9
monica,"Yeah, and you know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.",6,9
chandler,Why can’t I tell them that we live together?,6,9
monica,Because they don’t know we’re dating.  Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?,6,9
chandler,Why haven’t you told them?!,6,9
monica,"Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t.",6,9
chandler,Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!,6,9
monica,So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I’ll see you then.,6,9
chandler,Why wouldn’t they be happy?,6,9
monica,"Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry.",6,9
chandler,What? What? Why?!,6,9
monica,"Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, you know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.",6,9
chandler,Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?,6,9
monica,"Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.",6,9
chandler,"you know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘them.",6,9
monica,You really think that’ll work?,6,9
chandler,"Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?",6,9
monica,I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!,6,9
chandler,"Hey!  Oh, good, Ross! You’re parents like me, right?",6,9
ross,"Yes, of course they like you!",6,9
chandler,Well Monica just told me that they don’t.,6,9
ross,"Yeah, they don’t like you.",6,9
chandler,Do you know why?,6,9
ross,"I don't know, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-",6,9
chandler,Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!,6,9
chandler,"This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.",6,9
joey,"Maybe I could give thanks for you shutting’ up, eh?",6,9
chandler,Maybe I could give thanks by taking my PlayStation over to my new apartment.,6,9
joey,Well maybe I love you’.,6,9
chandler,,6,9
janine,Hey.,6,9
chandler,Hey.,6,9
janine,Hey guys!,6,9
ross,"No I don’t want to play video games, Joey!",6,9
janine,Are you guys going to Chandler’s for Thanksgiving?,6,9
joey,"Yeah! Yeah, why? What’s up?",6,9
janine,"Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.",6,9
ross,For real?,6,9
janine,"No, but you should go to Chandler’s. Because none of us knows how to cook, we’ll probably just end up drinking all day.",6,9
joey,"Ye-ye, we go to yours!",6,9
ross,"Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh you know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.",6,9
janine,Okay.,6,9
joey,"How you got three women to marry you, I’ll never know.",6,9
phoebe,Hey!,6,9

rachel,"Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!",6,9
phoebe,"Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel’s dessert is.. so good that I eat all of it. There’s none left for anybody else!",6,9
monica,Nothing.,6,9
rachel,Nothing?,6,9
monica,"No, sweetie, I-I trust you.",6,9
rachel,"So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?",6,9
monica,You’re not going to mess it up.,6,9
rachel,"Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?",6,9
monica,"Well, it’s done about two minutes before it looks like that.",6,9

ross,"Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having.",6,9
monica,"Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?",6,9
ross,"Some would say she’s attractive, yes.",6,9
phoebe,And who else is going to be there?,6,9
joey,"Uh, some of her friends, yeah.",6,9
rachel,Her dancer friends?,6,9
joey,"Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are going to be there and they’re going to be, be drinking’ and dancing, and we really want to go!",6,9
ross,"Dude, we were good!",6,9
monica,"You’re not going to go anywhere, you said you were going to eat here, and you’re going to eat here!",6,9
phoebe,"Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.",6,9
ross,"Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.",6,9
joey,"Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!",6,9
mrs. geller,Hello everybody!,6,9
mr. geller,Hi!,6,9
all,Hi!,6,9
monica,"Dad, Mom. Look! Look who it is it’s Chandler!",6,9
mrs. geller,"Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.",6,9
chandler,"Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!",6,9
chandler,"Whoa, snowing out there?",6,9
mr. geller,No.,6,9
mr. geller,"Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.",6,9
mr. geller,"Ok, I have dandruff. There’s no need to laugh and point.",6,9
monica,"Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.",6,9
mr. geller,My joke wasn’t funny.,6,9
phoebe,"Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.",6,9
rachel,Really?!,6,9
phoebe,"Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. you know, I mean he used to be just, you know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad” and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller, dream hunk.""",6,9
rachel,"I don't know. you know to me he’ll always be “Jack Geller, walks in while you’re changing.”",6,9
monica,"you know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!",6,9
chandler,"Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, you know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.",6,9
mr. geller,"I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?",6,9
chandler,He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.,6,9
joey,"Rach, you’re killing’ us here, will you serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!",6,9
rachel,"Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?",6,9
ross,"Yeah, yeah, what is it?",6,9
rachel,"It’s a truffle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",6,9
ross,W-What was the one right before bananas?,6,9
rachel,"The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, you know, I thought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” I mean that’s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, you know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?",6,9
joey,Y-sure!,6,9
rachel,And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.,6,9
joey and ross,Okay.,6,9
ross,"Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!",6,9
joey,"I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?",6,9
ross,"Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!",6,9
joey,Chandler!,6,9
ross,"Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!",6,9
joey,Oh man! Now she’s going to start all over! We’re never going to get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!,6,9
ross,"No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.",6,9
joey,Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?,6,9
ross,"Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!",6,9
joey,Vomiting stories are funny...,6,9
rachel,"Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!",6,9
joey,Did-did it make you want to walk around in your underwear?,6,9
rachel,No!,6,9
joey,Still not hot enough!,6,9
phoebe,Rachel?,6,9
rachel,Yeah?,6,9
phoebe,"Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t give to be that can of  condensed milk.",6,9
monica,"Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.",6,9
mrs. geller,"Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.",6,9
chandler,"Oh, yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight. I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at-",6,9
mr. geller,What’s the matter with him?,6,9
mrs. geller,I think he’s stoned again.,6,9
chandler,What?,6,9
monica,What?,6,9
ross,"Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.",6,9
ross,"Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.",6,9
chandler,You do? Why?,6,9
ross,"Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.",6,9
chandler,What?! Why did you do that?,6,9
ross,"I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.",6,9
chandler,How could it not matter?!,6,9
ross,"How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?",6,9
chandler,What about all that “friends forever” stuff?,6,9
ross,"I don’t know, I-I was all high.",6,9
monica,Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get Ross stoned!,6,9
chandler,Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!,6,9
monica,"Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!",6,9
chandler,"The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?",6,9
ross,"Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘them it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?",6,9
monica,You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything!,6,9
ross,"Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?",6,9
monica,"Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you’re going to put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-",6,9
phoebe,"Monica, leave him alone!",6,9
joey,Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking a lot!?,6,9
rachel,"No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.",6,9
joey,Well you’re whipping’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?,6,9
rachel,"Joey! Come on! I don’t want to make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's going to be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”",6,9
rachel,"So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?",6,9
joey,Oh I am!,6,9
monica,"Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!",6,9
ross,"Okay, fine!",6,9
joey,Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?,6,9
ross,"Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.",6,9
joey,"Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.",6,9
ross,"What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!",6,9
joey,"Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re all going to’ make fun of her, do you want that?",6,9
ross,"Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way no one makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potato Pie!",6,9
joey,"Dude, they’re not objects.",6,9
joey,"Just kidding,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach.",6,9
ross,"Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?",6,9
rachel,Okay...,6,9
rachel,"What’s up, Ross?",6,9
ross,"So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?",6,9
rachel,Yeah!,6,9
ross,And um...You look nice today.,6,9
rachel,"Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this.",6,9
ross,What?,6,9
rachel,I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.,6,9
ross,Eh?,6,9
rachel,"I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. you know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.",6,9
ross,You’re alone.,6,9
rachel,"No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re alone, alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.",6,9
ross,"Ah well, can’t blame a guy for trying!",6,9
joey,"Oh and  Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach  or uh, or saying “mmm” and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?",6,9
chandler,"Yeah, I’m not going to pay for those acting classes anymore.",6,9
joey,"Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already!",6,9
rachel,"Joey, you’re going to have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert.",6,9
joey,Really?,6,9
rachel,"No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it’s trifle time!",6,9
phoebe,"So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it?",6,9
rachel,It sure is.,6,9
phoebe,Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?,6,9
rachel,Beef.,6,9
phoebe,I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat.  oh no.,6,9
rachel,"Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.",6,9
monica,Really?,6,9
rachel,"Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! You got to take a bite with all the layers!",6,9
monica,Okay.,6,9
rachel,"Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.",6,9
rachel,Well?,6,9
monica,Mmm! It’s good!,6,9
rachel,Really? How good?,6,9
monica,"It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.",6,9
all,Mmm.,6,9
chandler,"Yeah, this is so good, that I’m going to go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.",6,9
mrs. geller,"I’ve got to call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica’s room.",6,9
mr. geller,I’ll help you dial.,6,9
monica,"I’m going to go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.",6,9
rachel,"Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.",6,9
ross,What? No no! Ah!   All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.,6,9
ross,It tastes like feet!,6,9
joey,I like it.,6,9
ross,Are you kidding?,6,9
joey,What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Good.,6,9
rachel,"...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?",6,9
chandler,"Yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.",6,9
phoebe,"Rachel, come here.  Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.",6,9
rachel,"Oh, Phoebe, do I want to hear this?",6,9
phoebe,"I don't know, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were going to get married, and he left, because he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.",6,9
rachel,"Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!",6,9
phoebe,"Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was so cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not going to happen.",6,9
mr. geller,"Boy, I’m glad I wore the big belt today.",6,9
phoebe,"Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.",6,9
monica,Ross? Let’s go.,6,9
ross,"Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.",6,9
monica,"Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance.",6,9
ross,What-what?,6,9
monica,Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!,6,9
mr. and mrs. geller,What?!,6,9
ross,"You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?",6,9
mr. and mrs. geller,Yes.,6,9
ross,Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry.,6,9
mrs. geller,It was you?,6,9
monica,"And Dad, you know that mailman that you got fired? He didn’t steal your Playboys! Ross did!",6,9
ross,"Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monica did!",6,9
monica,Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!,6,9
ross,Monica and Chandler are living together!,6,9
monica,Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!,6,9
phoebe,I love Jacques Cousteau!,6,9
rachel,I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!,6,9
joey,I want to go!,6,9
mrs. geller,"That’s a lot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if want to leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren’t supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I’m sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead.  Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.",6,9
mr. geller,And we kind of figured about the porch swing.,6,9
mrs. geller,"Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?",6,9
mr. geller,What happened son?,6,9
ross,"I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!",6,9
mrs. geller,"Chandler! You’ve been Ross’s best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems.  And now you’ve taken on Monica as well. Well, I don’t know what to say. You’re a wonderful human being.",6,9
chandler,Thank you!,6,9
mr. geller,"No! Thank you!  Monica, and Ross! I don’t know what I’m going to do about the two of you!",6,9
chandler,I’ll talk to them!,6,9
rachel,"You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!",6,9
monica,"Well actually, I-I didn’t eat mine. It’s still in the bathroom.",6,9
joey,"No it isn’t, I ate that.",6,9
mrs. geller,Well we left ours in Monica’s bedroom.,6,9
joey,"Nope, got it and I got yours  too.",6,9
chandler,"Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.",6,10
rachel,"That’s a good story, Grandpa.",6,10
ross,Hey,6,10
all,Hey,6,10
ross,"Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?",6,10
monica,Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It’s about being with the people that you love.,6,10
phoebe,That is nice and we’re done. TADA!,6,10
chandler,"I don't know what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.",6,10
monica,"Oh, here.",6,10
chandler,See now it feels like Christmas!,6,10
ross,"and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.",6,10
rachel,"So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.",6,10
joey,Hey you guys.,6,10
chandler,Hey Joe what’s up?,6,10
joey,"I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. you know, everywhere I look she’s like",6,10
chandler,I can see why that’s hard to resist.,6,10
joey,I like her so much!,6,10
monica,"Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.",6,10
joey,I know. And she’s so sweet. I just want to feed her grapes and brush her hair.,6,10
chandler,"You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?",6,10
ross,"I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS!",6,10
janine,Hey guys!,6,10
ross,Hi Janine!,6,10
janine,I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year’s Eve. It’s called some sort of Dick’n Rock’n Dickie Eve.,6,10
monica,Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve?,6,10
janine,"Yeah, that’s what I said.",6,10
monica,Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!,6,10
chandler,"Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you?",6,10
janine,Well I’m going to be on it this year. I’m going to be one of the party people.,6,10
ross,You’re going to be a party person! Those guys rock the most!,6,10
janine,Well they said I should bring someone.  Do you want to be my dance partner?,6,10
joey,Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.,6,10
janine,Well actually they’re taping tomorrow. I don’t really understand why.,6,10
ross,"Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.",6,10
janine,"Yeah well, do you guys want to come too?",6,10
ross,Are you serious?,6,10
monica,We are there!,6,10
chandler,"What, what are you laughing at?",6,10
rachel,"Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!",6,10
janine,Thanks.  Great so we can all go together! I got to run. Catch you later!,6,10
all,Bye!,6,10
ross,Bye Janine!,6,10
joey,Did she just ask me out on a date?,6,10
chandler,I don’t think so.,6,10
monica,What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!,6,10
rachel,"Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.",6,10
joey,"Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! you know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’",6,10
rachel,"Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.",6,10
ross,It was a dry day.,6,10
monica,We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!,6,10
ross,Oh my God!,6,10
monica,Oh my God!,6,10
chandler,Oh my God!,6,10
joey,"OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal. The important thing to remember – stay cool.",6,10
ross,Got it!,6,10
ross,Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!,6,10
director,"OK, everyone gather up.",6,10
monica and ross,‘excuse us,6,10
director,"Here’s what’s going to happen. The music’s going to start, you’re going to dance, we’re going to tape, you don’t look at the camera. Any questions?",6,10
ross,"Yeah, I have a question. When is this going to air?",6,10
director,"Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.",6,10
joey,Ross! So when is it going to air?,6,10
rachel,"Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.",6,10
chandler,"I can save you time ladies, I’m right here.",6,10
phoebe,"Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you.",6,10
rachel,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.,6,10
chandler,What? That’s terrible!,6,10
phoebe,"No-no, we do it every year!",6,10
chandler,"Oh well, that makes it not terrible.",6,10
phoebe,"No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx.",6,10
rachel,"Don’t worry, we’re just going to search here for an hour, them we’re going to go over to Joey’s and search, OK?",6,10
chandler,"No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents!",6,10
phoebe,But we have to!,6,10
chandler,"No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live here too.",6,10
phoebe,"Well then, you should look with us.",6,10
chandler,Why?,6,10
rachel,"Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?",6,10
chandler,"No, I have a great idea for a present for her.",6,10
phoebe,"Oh, that’s it?  A great idea!",6,10
rachel,"Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just going to make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?",6,10
chandler,"If I help, we can find ‘them faster!",6,10
rachel,That’s right!,6,10
phoebe,"Ooh ooh, we have a live one!",6,10
rachel,"Oh, it’s a Macy’s bag!",6,10
phoebe,"Ooh, who’s it for?",6,10
rachel,"Dear losers, do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you.",6,10
phoebe,Uh-oh. She may be onto us.,6,10
rachel,We are so going to find them this year.,6,10
chandler,"you know when you guys said you were going to go across the hall and look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?",6,10
rachel,Yeah.,6,10
chandler,"You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?",6,10
phoebe and rachel,"No, we never do that",6,10
chandler,"Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!",6,10
monica,"Okay, here comes another camera.",6,10
ross,Right. No biggie. Stay loose.,6,10
ross,Why do they keep doing that?,6,10
monica,"If we want to get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day.",6,10
ross,Right.,6,10
ross,"Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?",6,10
girl,We learned how to dance.,6,10
monica,Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?,6,10
ross,Yeah!,6,10
janine,Hey! You’re a good dancer!,6,10
joey,Really?,6,10
janine,"Yeah, well you’d be better if you just loosened your hips a little.",6,10
joey,What do you mean?,6,10
janine,Like this.,6,10
janine,"That’s it, feel the rhythm. That’s better.",6,10
joey,Uh-huh.,6,10
director,"Okay, you’re dancing with that girl over there.",6,10
joey,No-no-no-no-no we came together!,6,10
director,"I don’t see it.  You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!",6,10
joey,"No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.",6,10
director,"Really, you think so? I don’t..",6,10
chandler,"I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!",6,10
rachel,"Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.",6,10
phoebe,"Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!",6,10

joey,"Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh, mellow!",6,10
tall guy,"Look, are you dating this girl you came with?",6,10
joey,"Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know",6,10
tall guy,"No, no. She’s fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!",6,10
joey,"Alright, alright, hey you know fair is fair,  if you’re right, you’re right, what can I say, but hey oh no!",6,10
tall guy,"God! What are you, in second grade?",6,10
joey,"Hey, now you’re the one who wet his pants.",6,10
monica,"Man, this sucks! you know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who’s going to be the losers then?",6,10
ross,"Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform!",6,10
monica,What?,6,10
ross,The routine!,6,10
monica,"Ross, we haven’t done the routine since middle school.",6,10
ross,"Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll want to build us our own platform!",6,10
monica,Was it really that good?,6,10
ross,"We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?",6,10
monica,"Okay, let’s do it. Mom and Dad are going to be so faced!",6,10
monica,5 6 7 8!,6,10

director,Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!,6,10
monica,Yes!,6,10
director,"Make sure you get this, they’re going to want it for the bloopers show.  Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it’s going to be the countdown to new years, so I want to see everybody’s excitement.",6,10
tall guy,"Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.",6,10
director,What’s going on over here?,6,10
joey,"Uh, take a look at the guy’s pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don’t you think he went a little overboard?",6,10
director,What’s the matter with you? Get out of here!,6,10
joey,"Yeah, take a hike wet pants!",6,10
ross,Can you believe this? We’re going to be on the platform for the Millennium moment!,6,10
monica,"I know! Hey, you haven’t been practising the routine, have you?",6,10
ross,No!,6,10
monica,Me too!,6,10
ross,"Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe going into the robot, you know?",6,10
monica,"Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t want to look stupid!",6,10
director,Alright we’re back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!,6,10

phoebe,Hey! Look who I found!,6,10
chandler,"Oh, hey guys!",6,10
phoebe,"you know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.",6,10
chandler,"Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.",6,10
phoebe,"Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!",6,10
chandler,"Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?",6,10
phoebe,"Hmm, how about my azzz?",6,10
rachel,"Hey, this is hollow.",6,10
phoebe,What?,6,10
rachel,"This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!!",6,10
phoebe,"No, don’t look directly at them!",6,10
chandler,What?,6,10
phoebe,"Alright, no, we could look at them!",6,10
rachel,"Oh, this one’s for me!",6,10
phoebe,"Oh, this one’s for Chandler. Here.",6,10
chandler,Oh great!,6,10
phoebe,And the big one’s for me!,6,10
rachel,"Ooh, let’s open them!",6,10
chandler,Okay! Okay! Okay!,6,10
phoebe,Hee hee!,6,10
chandler,"Wait, we can’t do this.",6,10
phoebe and rachel,Why?,6,10
chandler,"I don’t want to know what Monica got me. you know? I mean, look, I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are going to ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.",6,10
rachel,"Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine.",6,10
chandler,"Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys, but I want to see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?",6,10
phoebe,Will you get us better gifts?,6,10
chandler,Fine!,6,10
monica,"Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?",6,10
chandler,That’s what you got me?,6,10
phoebe,"Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.",6,10
joey,"Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year’s going to go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic, you know? Anyway, good night!",6,10
janine,Joey.,6,10
joey,Yeah?,6,10
janine,"3, 2, 1.  Happy New Year.",6,10
joey,"Oh, yoii. What was that for?",6,10
janine,"Well, I don’t know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn’t get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you",6,10
joey,"Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.",6,10
janine,"In the moment, yeah.",6,10
joey,But only in the moment. So do you want to kiss again?,6,10
janine,"Sure, New Year’s Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?",6,10
joey,No.,6,10
janine,Me neither.,6,10
joey,"3, 2,",6,10
janine,"Joey, you don’t have to count down every time we kiss.",6,10
joey,"Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sort of felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.",6,10
monica,"We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’",6,10
rachel,"Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?",6,10
monica,"Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!",6,10
rachel,‘Cos I was going to say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!,6,10
monica,What? We could do it!,6,10
ross,"I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.",6,10
monica,"I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go.",6,10
monica and ross,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8",6,10
monica,I can’t do it!,6,10
chandler,"Now you do that, you’re on TV.",6,10
joey,Hey!,6,11
ross,Hey!,6,11
joey,"Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?",6,11
monica,"Honey, we have been through this before!",6,11
rachel,Yeah. Don’t do this to yourself.,6,11
phoebe,"She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.",6,11
joey,"Well all right then, I guess I shouldn’t get to excited about the fact  that I just kissed her!",6,11
monica,You serious?!,6,11
chandler,That’s great!,6,11
monica,Really?!,6,11
phoebe,"Yeah well, we’ll see.",6,11
ross,You kissed her.,6,11
joey,Oh we kissed it up real nice.,6,11
chandler,"So you kissed her, so what happened after that?",6,11
joey,I came over here to tell you guys.,6,11
chandler,So she’s just waiting over there for you?,6,11
janine,I got to go.,6,11
joey,Okay.,6,11
janine,I’m going to be really late for dance class!,6,11
joey,Okay.,6,11
janine,"Okay, now I’m really late.",6,11
joey,"Okay, I’m all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?",6,11
janine,Bye.,6,11
monica,Bye.,6,11
joey,Have you kissed her yet? It’s awesome! I could do it forever! you know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!,6,11
monica,I am so glad you said cooks.,6,11
rachel,I know.,6,11
chandler,"Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.",6,11
rachel,"Oh-oh, Pottery Barn!  You can throw the rest away.",6,11
chandler,I’m not your garbage man. I’m your mailman.,6,11
rachel,Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.,6,11
monica,You got it from Pottery Barn?!,6,11
rachel,Yeah! It’s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?,6,11
chandler,A pharmacist.,6,11
monica,"Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.",6,11
joey,I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!,6,11
chandler,You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!,6,11
joey,I was tired!,6,11
rachel,Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!,6,11
monica,"Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.",6,11
rachel,Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.,6,11
monica,"It’s got to be one of a kind. you know like umm, you know uh, what’s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?",6,11
joey,Hey! I made that for her!,6,11
chandler,You made pottery?,6,11
joey,Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.,6,11
monica,I’m telling—If you put that in her apartment you’ll never hear the end of it.,6,11
rachel,"Okay fine! I’ll-I’ll just tell her it’s an antique apothecary table, she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.",6,11
chandler,"Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore",6,11
chandler,"so then the farmer says, ""That’s not a cow and you’re not milking it.""",6,11
monica,"I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!",6,11
chandler,"Look at us, we’re a couple of couples!",6,11
janine,"I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.",6,11
monica,Yeah.,6,11
joey,And Chandler I can’t believe I let you pay for this one.  Thanks man.,6,11
monica,So do you guys going to come over tomorrow? I’ll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.,6,11
janine,Oh that would be great!,6,11
joey,"Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.",6,11
monica,"Joey, you don’t have too!",6,11
joey,Nope-op! I insist!  You get the wine right?,6,11
chandler,"Yeah all right.  Okay, good night guys.",6,11
joey,See you tomorrow!,6,11
monica,Tomorrow!,6,11
janine,Can’t wait!,6,11
janine,How are we going to get out of that one?,6,11
joey,What?,6,11
janine,I can’t handle two nights in a row with them.,6,11
joey,What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?,6,11
janine,"I don’t know, they’re just a little blah!",6,11
joey,Blah?!,6,11
janine,"Well you know, he’s blah, she’s just—she’s very loud for such a small person.",6,11
joey,"Uh, they’re like my best friends. Are you saying we can’t hang out with them? Because that would kind of be a problem.",6,11
janine,"No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just you know, not two nights in a row. Okay?",6,11
joey,I guess.,6,11
janine,Thank you.,6,11
joey,"If you want, I’ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.",6,11
phoebe,Hey!,6,11
rachel,Hey!,6,11
phoebe,"Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?",6,11
rachel,Guess!,6,11
phoebe,"Umm, a flea market?",6,11
rachel,"Ha! See, I knew, I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’t it cool! It’s an apothecary table.",6,11
phoebe,Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where  they kept all the stuff to make their potions.,6,11
rachel,"OH, yes.",6,11
phoebe,"you know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.",6,11
rachel,Almost.,6,11
phoebe,How much was it?,6,11
rachel,It was only 500 bucks.,6,11
phoebe,500 bucks at a flea market?!,6,11
rachel,"Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, you know like back then.",6,11
phoebe,Oh no.,6,11
rachel,"Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was you know, it was like a dollar.",6,11
phoebe,A dollar?,6,11
rachel,And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.,6,11
phoebe,"OH, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.",6,11
rachel,Yeah.,6,11
phoebe,"Well, what period is it from?",6,11
rachel,"Uh, it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. you know?",6,11
phoebe,"Yes, yes I do. God, oh it’s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like you know where it was from or",6,11
rachel,"Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.",6,11
phoebe,"White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.",6,11
rachel,Hey! We’re here!,6,11
ross,Hey!,6,11
rachel,OH! Oh my God!,6,11
ross,You like it?,6,11
rachel,Oh no!,6,11
ross,It’s my new apothecary table!,6,11
rachel,"Ross! Phoebe’s going to be here any second, she cannot see this!",6,11
ross,Well why not?! She’ll-she’ll love it! It’s the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.,6,11
rachel,I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she’s going to know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.,6,11
ross,Why did you do that?,6,11
rachel,Because she hates Pottery Barn.,6,11
ross,She hates Pottery Barn?!!,6,11
rachel,"I know! I know, she says it’s all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.  So come on, she’s going to be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?",6,11
ross,"What? No! No! I am not going to hide it from Phoebe—Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!",6,11
rachel,"Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!",6,11
ross,"Uh, yeah! I still can’t believe she hates Pottery Barn!",6,11
rachel,"Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you.",6,11
ross,Yeah but Pottery Barn! you know what I think? It’s just she-she’s weird. you know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird.,6,11
rachel,"Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.",6,11
ross,Huh. you know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!,6,11
phoebe,Hey!,6,11
rachel,Hey!,6,11

monica,Hey!,6,11
joey,Hi!,6,11
monica,The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.,6,11
chandler,"And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight.  You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn’t afford it, because you paid dinner last night.",6,11
joey,"Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it’s just going to be me again tonight.",6,11
monica,What happened to Janine?,6,11
joey,"Oh, she’s uh-uh really sick.",6,11
chandler,Oh that’s too bad.,6,11
joey,"Yeah, she’s been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem… Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!",6,11
janine,Monica! Chandler! I’m really-really sorry about tonight. I don’t know if Joey told you; I just couldn’t get out of going to this play. I’m sorry. Have a great time.,6,11
joey,‘Kay!,6,11
janine,Bye.,6,11
chandler,"That’s funny, I saw no phlegm.",6,11
joey,"No-no, she really is sick!",6,11
chandler,Then why-why is she going to a play?!,6,11
joey,"Uh, you know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.",6,11
monica,Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!,6,11
joey,"Well uh, she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I’m so sorry.",6,11
chandler,"Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!",6,11
joey,"Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.",6,11
monica,What?!!  What?,6,11
chandler,So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!,6,11
monica,"Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!",6,11
chandler,"And I am not blah, I am a hoot!",6,11
joey,"I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don’t-don’t be mad. I’m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! you know? And it was our first date! Plus, she’s really sick!",6,11
chandler,"No, you sh—No you said you made that up!!",6,11
joey,"I know, but don’t you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?",6,11
chandler,"Eh, they’re both good. I generally just go with, Monica’s drunk again.",6,11
joey,"Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She’ll come around I promise.",6,11
monica,"Of course we will, come on we got to make dinner.",6,11
chandler,Okay.,6,11
monica,I do not like that woman!,6,11
joey,I can hear you!,6,11
monica,I am loud!,6,11
all,Aww!,6,11
rachel,That’s funny.,6,11
ross,"Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new……old sheet?",6,11
phoebe,Oh sure!  No!,6,11
rachel,OH!!,6,11
ross,My apothecary table!!!,6,11
phoebe,What?!,6,11
rachel,No!!,6,11
phoebe,"Ross, where did you get this?!",6,11
ross,I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!,6,11
rachel,"Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!",6,11
phoebe,"Wow! Oh my God, well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!",6,11
rachel,Oh yes.,6,11
phoebe,Well this doesn’t even smell like opium.,6,11
ross,"Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.",6,11
phoebe,"Oh Ross, calm down, I’ll give you the 80 cents.",6,11
chandler,"Okay, one more time.",6,11
monica,"Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?",6,11
chandler,Perfect decibel.,6,11
monica,I know!!!,6,11
joey,Hey!,6,11
chandler,Hey.,6,11
joey,"So uh, what are you guys doing?",6,11
chandler,"Oh nothing, we’re just talking. you know, blah-blah-blah.",6,11
joey,"Look, come on you guys, you said you were going to try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.",6,11
monica,"Well, I’d like to but,  I’m not sure we have time to go.",6,11
joey,"Ha-ha, very funny—Look! I don’t know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!",6,11
monica,We owe you?!,6,11
joey,"That’s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!",6,11
monica,We didn’t give you any money!,6,11
joey,You don’t think I know that!,6,11
rachel,"see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.",6,11
ross,Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.,6,11
rachel,"I know, I know. I went a little crazy.",6,11
ross,A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!,6,11
phoebe,Hey!,6,11
rachel,Hey.,6,11
phoebe,"Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.",6,11
ross,Fascinating.,6,11
phoebe,Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!,6,11
rachel,"Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.",6,11
phoebe,Ah!,6,11
ross,"Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?",6,11
rachel,"Well there’s yore. And uh, you know, yesteryear.",6,11
phoebe,"Yeah no, I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, you know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.",6,11
rachel,Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.,6,11
phoebe,"Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.",6,11
ross,"Really?!  Hey, you know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.",6,11
rachel,"you know what? I don’t, I don’t think Phoebe really wants to come.",6,11
phoebe,No! I do want to!,6,11
rachel,"Oh, she does want to.",6,11
ross,She does want to.,6,11
phoebe,Yeah!,6,11
rachel,"Pheebs, I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.",6,11
phoebe,Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.,6,11
rachel,Yeah.,6,11
phoebe,"Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!",6,11
rachel,"Yeah, you know what? Don’t look at it.  Seriously, don’t look at it.",6,11
phoebe,No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!,6,11
rachel,"Ugh, those bastards! Let’s go.",6,11
phoebe,That fan kind of looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait a sec! This is our exact living room!,6,11
rachel,"No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don’t have the…  We don’t have the…that lamp! And-and that screen is you know, on the other side.",6,11
phoebe,"Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!",6,11
rachel,"Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just… Come on don’t be mad.",6,11
phoebe,"No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don’t have that lamp!",6,11
rachel,"Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.",6,11
phoebe,I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?,6,11
rachel,What?! No! I’m not going to move out!,6,11
phoebe,But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that lamp?,6,11
rachel,Oh. Yes! I would so move out!,6,11
phoebe,Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!,6,11
rachel,That’s right!,6,11
phoebe,But at least the apothecary table is real.,6,11
joey,"Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?",6,11
janine,"Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I’ve got to say, I’m sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.",6,11
chandler,That’s totally understandable.,6,11
monica,Don’t worry about it.,6,11
janine,So we can go out again?,6,11
chandler,Oh yeah!,6,11
monica,Absolutely!,6,11
janine,Oh good.,6,11
joey,"Oh well then, good night!",6,11
monica,Good night!,6,11
joey,"See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?",6,11
janine,We have got to move!,6,11
monica,"I knew it!! you know, you’re not so quiet yourself, missy!",6,11
chandler,"And I’m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it,  ""Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment.""",6,11
janine,"you know, I know you’re talking, but all I hear is, ""Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah.""",6,11
monica,All right! You and me! Let’s go! Right now!,6,11
joey,All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough!  You two go home! I-I-I got to talk to Janine!,6,11
chandler,you know I think you can take her.,6,11
monica,You’d better hope I don’t see you in the hallway!!,6,11
joey,"All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can’t treat them that way.",6,11
janine,"They said stuff to me too, you know!",6,11
joey,"I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They… They’re like my family. If you guys are going to be fighting all the time, I-I… I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’t work. It can’t.  I’m very upset.",6,11
janine,"Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?",6,11
joey,Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.,6,11
monica,What did I tell you about the hall?!,6,11
janine,I was just coming over here to apologize for my behaviour! I’d really like it if we could be friends.,6,11
monica,"Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.",6,11
janine,Great.,6,11
monica,"Now come on.  Well, I’m glad we worked things out.",6,11
janine,Me too.,6,11
monica,Okay.,6,11
janine,I’ll see you.,6,11
monica,Bye.,6,11
janine,Or I’ll hear you.,6,11
monica,That’s it big girl!  Come on!,6,11
janine,Wait!,6,11
monica,You’d better run!,6,11
chandler,Did you hear that?,6,11
joey,"Yeah uh, what am I going to do?",6,11
chandler,"Yeah, I’m sorry man.  You want to go watch?",6,11
joey,Yeah!,6,11
ross,Hey!,6,11
joey,How you doin’?,6,11
chandler,"Hey so, did uh, did she move out?",6,11
joey,"Pretty much, yeah.",6,11
monica,I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.,6,11
joey,"Well, when it’s not right, you know it.",6,11
chandler,You okay?,6,11
joey,Yeah! Yeah. I’ll be all right.,6,11
ross,you know what would cheer you up?,6,11
joey,What?,6,11
ross,"I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.",6,11
joey,You’re right! That did cheer me up!,6,11
ross,"Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!",6,12
phoebe,I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.,6,12
ross,"Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.",6,12
monica,"That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us.",6,12
ross,"Here, check it out. It’s the first one, too.",6,12
chandler,That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.,6,12
ross,What?,6,12
chandler,I made that joke up.,6,12
ross,"Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did.",6,12
chandler,"Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard.",6,12
ross,"Hey, tell Dan, ‘Thanks.’",6,12
ross,What?,6,12
rachel,"I’m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.",6,12
chandler,"Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?",6,12
monica,No.,6,12
chandler,Seriously?,6,12
monica,"Well, you tell a lot of jokes!",6,12
ross,"Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?",6,12
chandler,"Yeah, I guess.",6,12
joey,Hey guys.,6,12
chandler,"Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.",6,12
ross,"No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’ll tell you.",6,12
chandler,It’s my joke.,6,12
ross,It’s my joke.,6,12
joey,"Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?",6,12
chandler,"Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.",6,12
joey,Let’s go watch it at your place.,6,12
chandler,"Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.",6,12
joey,"Chandler, Chandler, you know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.",6,12
chandler,"What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?",6,12
joey,"No, that’s VH-1. I got to tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know",6,12
chandler,"Joey, why is your cable out?",6,12
joey,"I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill",6,12
chandler,"If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?",6,12
joey,"No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.",6,12
chandler,Whoa ho.,6,12
joey,"I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .",6,12
chandler,"All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?",6,12
joey,Sure.,6,12
chandler,Paid your phone bill?,6,12
joey,Not so much.,6,12
phoebe,Hey.,6,12
monica,It’s only you.,6,12
phoebe,Wh-wh-what are you doing?,6,12
rachel,We are looking at a Playboy.,6,12
phoebe,"Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!",6,12
monica,"So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?",6,12
rachel,"Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’",6,12
monica,"Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.",6,12
phoebe,"Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?",6,12
rachel and monica,Yeah.,6,12
rachel,"You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy",6,12
monica,"Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?",6,12
rachel,I don’t know.,6,12
monica,Me neither.,6,12
phoebe,Rachel.,6,12
monica,What?!,6,12
phoebe,I don’t know.  Me neither.,6,12
joey,You forget how many great songs Heart had.,6,12
chandler,Yeah.,6,12
ross,"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",6,12
chandler,"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",6,12
joey,"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I got to say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",6,12
ross,"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",6,12
chandler,And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,6,12
chandler,You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.,6,12
ross,"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",6,12
chandler,"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",6,12
ross,"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.",6,12
chandler,"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.",6,12
ross,"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?",6,12
chandler,Yeah!,6,12
ross,"Well, I’m not going to go now anyway .",6,12
chandler,Okay .,6,12
gunther,Here you go.,6,12
joey,"Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, paying’ for stuff.",6,12
gunther,"Well, if you want, you can work here.",6,12
joey,"Uh, I don’t know. You see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera you know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.",6,12
gunther,"Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.",6,12
joey,What?!,6,12
gunther,Flexible hours.,6,12
joey,Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?,6,12
monica,"She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.",6,12
chandler,"He took my joke, he took it.",6,12
monica,It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.,6,12
chandler,"You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. you know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.",6,12
monica,That’s a good idea.,6,12
chandler,Yeah!,6,12
monica,Do you know what’s a bad idea?,6,12
chandler,Picking Rachel.,6,12
monica,That’s right.  Did you hear something?,6,12
chandler,Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.,6,12
monica,It’s coming from the living room.,6,12
joey,I finished my book.,6,12
monica,"Hey, you guys.",6,12
phoebe and rachel,Hey.,6,12
monica,"Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.",6,12
rachel,"Monica, what are you doing?",6,12
monica,"Nothing, I’m just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day.  Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.",6,12
phoebe,I guess it was kind of funny.,6,12
monica,It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me?,6,12
phoebe,Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kind of high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!,6,12
monica,"That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!",6,12
phoebe,"No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.",6,12
rachel,"Well, people are different.",6,12
phoebe,"You, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want. you know, you can just walk all over her.",6,12
rachel,"What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.",6,12
phoebe,"Oh, okay,  you’re not a pushover.",6,12
rachel,"Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to lunch.",6,12
monica,You start working on that list.,6,12
rachel,I cannot believe her.,6,12
monica,I know. Where do you want to go eat?,6,12
rachel,"Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.",6,12
monica,I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.,6,12
rachel,"All right, wherever you want to go is cool.",6,12
monica,All right.,6,12
ross,"Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.",6,12
gunther,"Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.",6,12
joey,"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, because I’m heading up there.",6,12
ross,"Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.",6,12
joey,Sure.  Coffee? Because I’m going up there.,6,12
rachel,No.,6,12
monica,"No, thank you.",6,12
joey,"You guys need anything, because I’m heading up there.",6,12
woman,I’d love an ice water.,6,12
joey,You got it.,6,12
monica,"Joey, what are you doing?",6,12
joey,Just being friendly.,6,12
rachel,"Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.",6,12
joey,"Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther?",6,12
gunther,Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron.,6,12
joey,"Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",6,12
monica,"Joey, do you work here?",6,12
joey,No.,6,12
customer,"Hey, waiter.",6,12
joey,Yeah?,6,12
monica,"Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?",6,12
joey,"It’s kind of embarrassing, you know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.",6,12
chandler,So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.,6,12
joey,"I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.",6,12
rachel,"Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.",6,12
ross,"Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?",6,12
joey,"Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.",6,12
ross,"Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.",6,12
joey,"See, now it’s weird again.",6,12
chandler,"I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make a lot of money, and here’s your first tip",6,12
rachel,"Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right.  A smile goes a long way.  And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.",6,12
joey,"Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. you know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.",6,12
ross,"Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?",6,12
joey,"Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.",6,12
rachel,Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.,6,12
phoebe,Okay.,6,12
monica,"So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?",6,12
rachel,"Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.",6,12
monica,Hah!,6,12
phoebe,"That true, I am flaky.",6,12
rachel,"So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?",6,12
phoebe,"Yeah, totally.",6,12
monica,"Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance.",6,12
rachel,"Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.",6,12
phoebe,That’s great. Good for you guys.,6,12
monica,I am not high maintenance!,6,12
rachel,I am not a pushover!,6,12
phoebe,Who said you were?,6,12
monica and rachel,You did!,6,12
phoebe,"Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.",6,12
joey,"Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.",6,12
gunther,"No, I’m leaving to get my hair dyed.",6,12
joey,"Really?! I like your natural colour. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’",6,12
gunther,That’s the whole part?,6,12
joey,"Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but",6,12
gunther,"Okay, I’ll see you in an hour.",6,12
joey,"Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’",6,12
patron,"Oh, excuse me.",6,12
joey,"No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?",6,12
patron,I believed you were saving this seat for someone.,6,12
joey,"So, you’d hire me, right?",6,12
patron,For what?,6,12
joey,"Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.",6,12
customers,Huh? What?,6,12
joey,"Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it.",6,12
ross,It’s my joke.,6,12
chandler,It’s my joke.,6,12
ross and chandler,It’s my joke.,6,12
ross,"you know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.",6,12
chandler,Let’s have Monica decide.,6,12
ross,Yeah!,6,12
chandler,Yeah!,6,12
ross,Hey Mon.,6,12
chandler,"Mon, get out here!",6,12
ross,Monica!,6,12
chandler,"Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.",6,12
monica,Why do I have to decide?,6,12
chandler,Because you’re the only one that can be fair.,6,12
ross,Yeah.,6,12
monica,I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.,6,12
ross,"Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.",6,12
chandler,"Don’t try to sway her.   I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go.",6,12
ross,We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.,6,12
monica,"Okay, Chandler, you go first.",6,12
chandler,"Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.",6,12
monica,"Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?",6,12
chandler,Can I finish my story?!,6,12
monica,Do you want me to pick you?!,6,12
ross,"See, I would never snap at you like that.",6,12
monica,Continue.,6,12
chandler,"So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.",6,12
ross,"Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!",6,12
chandler,I’m not arguing with that.,6,12
monica,"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",6,12
monica,"You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!",6,12
ross,It’s your joke.,6,12
chandler,Is not.,6,12
monica,"Hi, Chandler. There you are.",6,12
chandler,"Hi, oh hi.",6,12
monica,"Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?",6,12
chandler,"Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.  Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and——generosity of spirit.",6,12
rachel,"Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.",6,12
phoebe,Really? I’ve heard better.,6,12
monica,"Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.",6,12
chandler,I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?,6,12
monica,"Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!",6,12
chandler,You’re a little high maintenance.,6,12
monica,Ah! You are on my list.,6,12
chandler,"I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you.",6,12
monica,I didn’t even tell him to say that. . All right you’re off my list.,6,12
chandler,I’m off the list.,6,12
monica,"Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.",6,12
phoebe,"you know, suddenly I find you very attractive.",6,12
chandler,"Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?",6,12
joey,"Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so",6,12
phoebe,Wow! That is a bad audition.,6,12
rachel,How-how did you lose your job here?,6,12
joey,"Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.",6,12
rachel,"He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right.",6,12
joey,"Yeah, what are you going to do?",6,12
rachel,"Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. You know what, I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, I really shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him.  Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him",6,12
gunther,Okay.,6,12
rachel,What?,6,12
gunther,He can have his job back.,6,12
rachel,"That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.",6,12
joey,That’s great. Thanks Rach.,6,12
rachel,"Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?",6,12
phoebe,"Rach, you’re in my seat.",6,12
rachel,"Oh, I’m sorry.",6,12
phoebe,"Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.",6,12
monica,"I pick you, Phoebe.",6,12
rachel,"Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.",6,12
phoebe,"Yeah, well, I kind of thought.",6,12
chandler,Hey.,6,12
rachel,"Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?",6,12
ross,No way.,6,12

monica,I have not been sick in over three years!,6,13
chandler,I’m going to grab you some tissue.,6,13
monica,I don’t need a tissue! I’m fine-d!,6,13
ross,When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.,6,13

jill,Daddy cut me off.,6,13

jill,"And you know what I said to him? ""I’m going to hire a lawyer and I’m going to sue you and take all your money. Then I’m going to cut you off!""",6,13
rachel,Wow! What did he say?,6,13
jill,That he wouldn’t pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he’s actually proud off.,6,13
rachel,Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud of me.,6,13
monica,Rach?,6,13
rachel,"Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?",6,13
jill,"Okay, I bought a boat.",6,13
monica,You bought a boat?,6,13
jill,"Yeah but it wasn’t for me, it was for a friend.",6,13
chandler,Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!,6,13
rachel,"Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re going to do. You’re going to get a job, you’re going to get an apartment, and then I’ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?",6,13
phoebe,"Of course, yeah!",6,13
jill,"Oh, that’s so great! Okay, I’m really going to do this! I don’t know how to thank you guys.",6,13

joey,What?!,6,13
gunther,For all the free food you gave away.,6,13
joey,"Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it?",6,13
gunther,We don’t give anything away unless it’s someone’s birthday.,6,13
joey,"Well, what if they came in third in a modelling contest?",6,13
gunther,No!,6,13
joey,Sorry!,6,13

ross,"Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.",6,13
jill,"Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!  This is my ""Please, hire me"" sweater.  And these are my, ""Don’t you want to rent me this apartment?"" pants.",6,13
ross,I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.,6,13
jill,"Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!",6,13
phoebe,"Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s going to think it’s a good idea.",6,13
jill,So who made her queen of the world?,6,13
phoebe,I would love that job!,6,13
rachel,Hey! What’s going’ on?,6,13
jill,Hey!,6,13
rachel,Jill! Did you shop?!,6,13
jill,No! They did!,6,13
phoebe and ross,"Yeah, we went shopping!",6,13
rachel,"You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!",6,13
phoebe,Sorry Jill.,6,13
ross,Sorry-sorry Jill.,6,13

rachel,"Oh, come on! You think that’s going to work on me?! I invented that!",6,13
jill,"Right! But, I am sorry.",6,13
rachel,"All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’t let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I’m just going to take the-the pajmena.  And the uh, and the uh pants. you know what, I’m just going to take it all away, because that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I’m going to run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.",6,13
jill,She took all my stuff.,6,13
ross,"Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.",6,13
jill,"That’s the best one! Oh my God,  thank you so much!",6,13
ross,Well. Hey,6,13
jill,"Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!",6,13
ross,"Oh yeah, how about you and the,  ""I’m sorry!""",6,13
jill,Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!,6,13
phoebe,"What about, what about when I said you know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?",6,13
jill,Were you this cute in high school?,6,13
ross,Oh stop.,6,13
jill,No you stop!,6,13
ross,"No, you stop!",6,13

chandler,"I know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids.",6,13
monica,"Okay, I’ll rest. But you know if I’m going to bed, then you’re coming with me.",6,13
chandler,That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy here.,6,13
monica,Are you saying that you don’t want to get with this?,6,13
chandler,"Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.",6,13
monica,Come on.,6,13
chandler,Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have sex with a sick person.,6,13
monica,"I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sick person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.",6,13
chandler,"That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.",6,13
rachel,Hey!,6,13
phoebe,Hey.,6,13
rachel,What’s up?!,6,13
phoebe,"Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know.",6,13
rachel,"Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.",6,13
phoebe,"No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.",6,13
rachel,What?!,6,13
phoebe,"Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.",6,13
rachel,With Ross and Jill?,6,13

phoebe,Yeah.,6,13
rachel,Oh there is no way.,6,13
phoebe,Okay then.,6,13
rachel,"Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they’re going to have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I don’t own Ross! you know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.",6,13
phoebe,"But great news about the apartment pants, huh?",6,13
joey,That’ll be $3.85.,6,13
woman,What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!,6,13
joey,"It’s just I can’t because my manager said I…   ""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie",6,13
woman,Amy!,6,13

rachel,"Oh hi! you know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.",6,13
jill,Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn’t go in. How strong am I?,6,13
rachel,"That is great. Hey, you know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.",6,13
jill,Yeah.,6,13
rachel,"Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you’re going to go out?",6,13
jill,Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?,6,13
rachel,"I just, Phoebe, said you know thought she saw something between you guys.",6,13
jill,No! I mean he’s nice.,6,13
rachel,Yeah.,6,13
jill,"He’s the kind of guy you’re friends with, you know? But he’s not the kind of guy you date. He’s the kind of guy you’d date because you did. Me, not so much.",6,13
rachel,"Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?",6,13
jill,"Oh no-no-no, he’s just I don’t know, he’s just a little bookish.",6,13
rachel,Are-are you saying he’s a geek?,6,13
jill,You think so too?,6,13
rachel,"No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!",6,13
jill,"Fine, then let’s just say he’s not my type.",6,13
rachel,What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!,6,13
jill,"Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I’ll ask him out.",6,13
rachel,"Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant.",6,13
jill,"No! you know what Rachel? You’re right, you know he has been really nice to me.",6,13
rachel,"Yeah but, he’s not your type.",6,13
jill,"Yeah but maybe that’s a good thing. you know I’m doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!",6,13
rachel,"Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try to much too fast. you know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you?",6,13
jill,What?,6,13

chandler,"Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.",6,13
monica,How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.,6,13
chandler,I was asleep.  Oh no! No-no honey! you know what’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.,6,13
monica,"Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I’m not sick! I want to make you feel, as good as I feel.",6,13

rachel,Really?!,6,13
ross,"Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, ""Why not?!""",6,13
rachel,Oh so-so not really never.,6,13
ross,"I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we’ve been through, I just—you know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.",6,13

monica,"Not now, I’m sick!",6,13
chandler,Oh come on you big faker!,6,13

chandler,Well that was before all the vaporizing action.,6,13
monica,"Okay, if you really want to have sex",6,13
chandler,Okay!,6,13
monica,Worked like a charm.,6,13

chandler,Is that a swing?,6,14
rachel,Oh don’t even ask!,6,14
chandler,Yuck!,6,14

rachel,"Oh, slides.  So really nothing happened.",6,14
ross,Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.,6,14
rachel,"Right. Was it the, ""Please don’t show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?""",6,14
ross,"Anyway, if she, if she wasn’t in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?",6,14
rachel,She asked-asked you out again?,6,14
ross,"Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine’s Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.",6,14
rachel,"Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can’t. It’s just too weird, all right?

rachel,"Yeah do it now, call right now.",6,14
monica,This is my favourite part.,6,14
phoebe,Yeah me too.,6,14
phoebe,Oh you know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.,6,14
chandler,"Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!",6,14
joey,You didn’t cry when Bambi’s mother died?,6,14
chandler,Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!,6,14
monica,Chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don’t have to be so macho all the time.,6,14
chandler,I’m not macho.,6,14
monica,Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.,6,14
chandler,"No, I guess I just never really cried. you know? I’m not a crying kind of guy.",6,14
joey,"Come on man there’s got to be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?",6,14
chandler,"I’d be sad sure, but I wouldn’t cry.",6,14
joey,"Okay, what if the puppy said, ""Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me.""",6,14
chandler,"Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I’m rich!",6,14
monica,"Oh, I’ve got it! I have got it!  Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!",6,14

chandler,"No! Look, I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?!",6,14
joey,No! It’s not okay! It’s not okay at all!! You’re dead inside!!,6,14

the fan,"Can-can I get your autograph, I’m your biggest fan.",6,14
phoebe,Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi!  Sure! Yeah!,6,14
the fan,"Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just want to say, I think you’re really talented.",6,14
phoebe,"You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan.   Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay?  He’s a fan.  Bye!",6,14
joey,"So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Ramoray for you?",6,14

the fan,Oh yeah! I’ve seen all her movies.,6,14
joey,Movies?,6,14
the fan,"That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.",6,14
joey,I don’t think so.,6,14
the fan,"No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren’t going to believe this!",6,14
joey,"Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe’s a porn star!",6,14
gunther,"Well, I wouldn’t call her a star, but she’s really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.",6,14
jill,Hey!,6,14
rachel,Hey!,6,14
jill,"You’ll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn’t even tell me why!",6,14
rachel,oh well. you know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.,6,14
jill,"you know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not going to date some random guy from your work.",6,14
rachel,"It’s not random, it’s Bob.",6,14
jill,It’s probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn’t like the way I dress—No that can’t be it. It’s really got to be the smart thing. Oh I’m so stupid! I’m just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!,6,14
rachel,"No honey, okay, okay, you want to know why Ross cancelled the date? Because I asked him to.",6,14
jill,You asked him too?!,6,14
rachel,Hm-mmm.,6,14
jill,Why?!,6,14
rachel,Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history,6,14
jill,"I don’t understand, do you want to go out with Ross?",6,14
rachel,No.,6,14
jill,"You don’t want him, but you don’t want me to have him?",6,14
rachel,you know Bob in Human Resources,6,14
jill,Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was!  You had me doubting my fashion sense!,6,14
rachel,"Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there, you just",6,14
jill,Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.,6,14
rachel,I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!,6,14
jill,Why are you so jealous of me?,6,14
rachel,Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!,6,14
jill,"Can’t have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can’t have is dairy!",6,14
rachel,"All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!",6,14
jill,Who?!,6,14
rachel,In Human Resources!!!!!!,6,14
rachel,I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!,6,14
monica,You’re jealous of Princess Caroline?,6,14
rachel,Do I have my own castle?,6,14
ross,"Hey! Uh, Phoebe’s not here is she?",6,14
rachel,No.,6,14
monica,Oh great! Did you get a movie?,6,14
joey,"Uhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kind you’re going to like.",6,14
chandler,You didn’t get more movies that are going to have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?,6,14
joey,Sort of,6,14
monica,"Guys, what’s going on?",6,14
joey,Phoebe’s a porn star!,6,14
all,What?!!,6,14
chandler,Phoebe Buffay in Buffay,6,14
rachel,Oh my God!,6,14
monica,That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that?,6,14
joey,Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.,6,14
ross,"And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there.",6,14
rachel,"Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. you know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.",6,14
monica,"This is so bizarre. I guess it kind of makes sense though, you know she had such a terrible childhood.",6,14
chandler,"Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn.",6,14
monica,"Yes, but you are dead inside.",6,14
joey,"All right well, I’d better take that back.",6,14
monica,"Wh-what, why?",6,14
joey,We can’t watch that! I mean that’s Phoebe!,6,14
monica,"Yeah you’re right, we can’t—we shouldn’t watch this.",6,14
rachel,Absolutely not.,6,14
monica,you know maybe a little bit!,6,14
rachel,Probably just the first half.,6,14
joey,"No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well, I’m not going to watch it!",6,14
ross,Yeah! Good for you Joe!,6,14
joey,Yeah.,6,14
"buffay, the vampire layer","Ah, I thought I’d find you here, Nasforatool.",6,14
the vampire,"Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?",6,14
"buffay, the vampire layer","Actually, I was kind of hoping it would be the other way around.",6,14
monica,Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?,6,14
chandler,Her ankle is what you’re watching?,6,14
rachel,"Well it’s hard to tell…  Oh God, if she would just stop moving.",6,14
chandler,She’s just doing her job!,6,14
joey,You sick bastards!,6,14
rachel,"Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t… Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!",6,14
joey,Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!,6,14
phoebe,Hey! What’s up?  Oh my God! What am I doing?!!,6,14
monica,Hey sweetie!,6,14
chandler,Hey!,6,14
monica,Chicken Soup for the Soul?,6,14
chandler,There’s no back to this couch!,6,14
monica,Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.,6,14
chandler,"Yeah I know, but I figured a shot you know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was you know, all dead inside.",6,14
monica,"Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you.",6,14
chandler,Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.,6,14
monica,Stop it!,6,14
chandler,"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and I’m like this.",6,14
monica,"I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.",6,14
chandler,Yeah?,6,14
monica,"Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me.",6,14
chandler,"Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then.",6,14
monica,"And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, ""I will always be with you,"" and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll be crying a river inside.",6,14
chandler,"Aww, I love you so",6,14
monica,What is wrong with you?!!!,6,14
chandler,What?!,6,14
monica,"What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!",6,14
chandler,So you didn’t mean any of that?!,6,14
monica,No you robot!!,6,14
ross,"You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to…  OH, uh Jill. Umm, that-that’s just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they’ve really taken a liking to me.  Uhh what’s-what’s-what’s the matter?",6,14
jill,"Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we’re not supposed to see each other anymore and I’m okay with that, it’s just that I don’t know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.",6,14
ross,"Of course, what happened?",6,14
jill,I don’t want to talk about it.,6,14
ross,"Okay, umm",6,14
jill,But you know what might really cheer me up?,6,14
ross,What?,6,14
jill,Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.,6,14
ross,Wow! Really?!,6,14
jill,"Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.",6,14
ross,"Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes!",6,14
jill,"Oh great! Thanks Ross, you’re such a good friend!",6,14
ross,OH!,6,14
rachel,Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere.,6,14
monica,"No, I haven’t.",6,14
rachel,"Well, is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s actually seen her.",6,14
ursula,Who is it?,6,14
phoebe,It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!,6,14
ursula,Hey!,6,14
phoebe,Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies.,6,14
ursula,No I’m not.,6,14
man’s voice,We’re still rolling!,6,14
phoebe,You’re making one right now!,6,14
another man’s voice,Let’s go Phoebe!,6,14
phoebe,And-and you’re using my name!,6,14
ursula,"Yeah, can I help you with something?",6,14
same man’s voice,"Phoebe, come on!",6,14
phoebe,"Look, I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her.",6,14
ursula,"you know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.",6,14
phoebe,What?!,6,14
ursula,"Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.",6,14
phoebe,No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you!  And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you  with that!,6,14
ross,Slides are almost ready.,6,14
jill,"Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!",6,14
ross,"Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen.",6,14
jill,Oh great!,6,14
ross,Hello?,6,14
rachel,What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!,6,14
ross,"O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking.",6,14
rachel,Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!,6,14
ross,So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!,6,14
rachel,"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!",6,14
ross,"you know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye.  Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me.",6,14
jill,So?,6,14
phoebe,Hey!,6,14
joey,Hey!,6,14
phoebe,"So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.",6,14
joey,"Oh no, not you too!",6,14
phoebe,No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.,6,14
joey,Nice!,6,14
phoebe,"Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.",6,14
joey,"That’s great, but isn’t it going to bother that people still think you’re a porn star?",6,14
phoebe,Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.,6,14
joey,You do?,6,14
phoebe,"Yeah.   You’re trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I’ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay?  Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!  See?",6,14
joey,Yeah.,6,14
chandler,Hey.,6,14
ross,"You uh, you may have been right about Jill.",6,14
rachel,Oh! I knew it! What happened?,6,14
ross,"Umm, she kissed me.",6,14
rachel,What?! You kissed!,6,14
chandler,Maybe we should give them some privacy.,6,14
monica,Shh!!!,6,14
ross,"Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?",6,14
rachel,"Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!",6,14
ross,"Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking",6,14
rachel,Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! you know what? Let me give you something to think about!,6,14
ross,Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.,6,14
rachel,"Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.",6,14
ross,Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!,6,14
rachel,What?!,6,14
ross,"No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.",6,14
rachel,"Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you.",6,14
ross,You’re welcome.,6,14
monica,Oh my God! Are-are you crying?,6,14
chandler,I just don’t see why those two can’t work things out!,6,14
jill,"All right, I’m leaving! Because I’m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That’s you Rachel!",6,14
rachel,"Yeah, I got that.",6,14
jill,"And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?",6,14
ross,You take care Jill.,6,14
jill,"Okay, see you!",6,14
rachel,Bye-bye-e!,6,14
monica,Bye.,6,14
chandler,"I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone.  I can’t help it, I opened a gate.",6,14
rachel,"Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!",6,15
monica,Oh my God!,6,15
phoebe,Wow!,6,15
joey,What is the matter with you?!,6,15
phoebe,No! Barry and Mindy.,6,15
joey,"Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross.  Who-who’s Barry and Mindy?",6,15
rachel,Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.,6,15
joey,"OH-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?",6,15
rachel,"Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.",6,15
monica,Why did they get divorced?,6,15
rachel,"Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?",6,15
ross,"I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.",6,15
phoebe,Which time?,6,15
ross,"The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.",6,15
joey,I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way.,6,15
ross,"I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from you know, not doing anything else physical.",6,15
chandler,Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.,6,15
monica,"And what if I was still fat?  Well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure.",6,15
chandler,Sure I would!,6,15
all,Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!,6,15
chandler,"What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow?",6,15
ross,"No, I just think Monica was that fat.",6,15
joey,"Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives!  Oh-hey, there’s Carol again!",6,15
chandler,"What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don’t have to wear a tie.",6,15
phoebe,What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?,6,15
ross,What?!,6,15
rachel,Merrill Lynch?,6,15
phoebe,"Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.",6,15
rachel,Well why didn’t you take the job?,6,15
phoebe,"Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought you know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.",6,15
ross,"Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out?",6,15
ross,Oh my God! Rachel Green?,6,15
rachel,Rob Tillman!,6,15
ross,"No-no. It’s-it’s me, Ross!",6,15
rachel,"Oh, I’m sorry. Ross Tillman.",6,15
ross,"No, no-no, Ross Geller.",6,15
rachel,"OH, of course Monica’s brother!",6,15
ross,Yeah. Right.,6,15
rachel,Wow! How are you?!,6,15
ross,"Good-good, I’m-I’m married.",6,15
rachel,OH! Me too!,6,15
ross,Is-isn’t it the best?,6,15
rachel,"Oh, it’s the best!  So, umm how’s Monica?",6,15
ross,"Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.",6,15
rachel,"OH, I would love too.",6,15
ross,"Yeah? Oh-oh, she’d be so excited!",6,15
rachel,OH! Okay!,6,15
ross,Come on!,6,15
rachel,"Oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?",6,15
ross,"No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t",6,15
rachel,Oh yeah? Okay.,6,15
ross,Okay.,6,15
rachel,But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?,6,15
ross,"Uh-huh.  Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you.  Okay, let’s go see Monica!",6,15
joey,"So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?",6,15
monica,He’s not boring! He’s just-he’s just low key.,6,15
boyfriend,"Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.",6,15
monica,Thanks.,6,15
boyfriend,"Yeah. you know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it’s a seed.",6,15
joey,Wow!!,6,15
boyfriend,Can anyone else name a well known seed that’s been masquerading as a nut?,6,15
joey,"Oh dear God, let me think.",6,15
chandler,Hey.,6,15
joey,Hey.,6,15
monica,Oh no! What’s the matter?,6,15
chandler,"Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not ""Archie Comic funny.""",6,15
boyfriend,you know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.,6,15
monica,Okay.,6,15
boyfriend,Okay.,6,15
monica,Bye.,6,15
boyfriend,"Bye-bye.  Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.",6,15
chandler,Was his question what’s more boring than him?,6,15
joey,"Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?",6,15
chandler,"Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.",6,15
joey,Really?,6,15
chandler,Ehh.,6,15
monica,"Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?",6,15
joey,"That’s an idea!  Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?",6,15
monica,"No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!",6,15
joey,That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that!,6,15
chandler,I could use the money; it could give me time to write.,6,15
joey,Oh right great! Welcome aboard!,6,15
chandler,Okay!,6,15
joey,"All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t need any assistance in there, take a break!",6,15
chandler,All right!,6,15
phoebe,Hey!,6,15
monica,Hey Phoebe! Guess what?,6,15
phoebe,What?,6,15
monica,Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!,6,15
phoebe,"OH that’s so sweet!  Oh! Hang on!  Hang on!!!   Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it’s a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it’s okay. It’s okay, you’re allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.",6,15
ross,Hey Mon!,6,15
monica,Hey!,6,15
ross,"Mon, look who I ran into!",6,15
monica,Oh my God! Rachel!!   You look terrific!,6,15
rachel,"OH, so do you! Did you lose weight?",6,15
monica,"You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!",6,15
ross,"And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.",6,15

monica,"Rach, he’s a friend of ours.",6,15
rachel,You are friends with Dr. Drake Ramoray?,6,15
chandler,Well it’s kind of hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.,6,15
ross,"Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!",6,15
rachel,He’s coming over! He’s coming over!,6,15
monica,Joey!,6,15
joey,"I know, here-here!!",6,15

rachel,Hi!,6,15
joey,Hi!,6,15
rachel,"Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you",6,15
joey,"Well, it’s always nice to meet the fans.",6,15
rachel,Ah!,6,15
joey,She’s not crazy is she?,6,15

chandler,Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.,6,15
monica,You realize what you are don’t you?,6,15
chandler,What?,6,15
monica,You’re his bitch.,6,15
phoebe,No-no!! No!!,6,15
monica,Oh wait! You didn’t just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!,6,15
phoebe,"No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.",6,15
chandler,But the Kit-Kats are all right?!,6,15
phoebe,"What am I going to do?! What am I going to do?! I can’t call my office they’ll kill me! I can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.",6,15
monica,What?!,6,15
phoebe,"My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can’t breathe.",6,15
chandler,"Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!",6,15
phoebe,"Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?",6,15
monica,Yes!!,6,15
phoebe,Then yes that is what I’m having.,6,15

carol,Like what?,6,15
ross,"Well I don’t know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?  Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.  Nah! Umm, you know we-we could try dirty talk?  Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.",6,15

joey,Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!,6,15
chandler,"Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them.",6,15

joey,"No! No! No, not after seeing that.",6,15
rachel,God I’m just a horrible person.,6,15

rachel,But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother.,6,15
joey,"Look, do you want the ring or not?!",6,15
rachel,Yeah!,6,15
ross,Hey!,6,15

joey,"But you got to be with both of them, right?",6,15
ross,Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.,6,15

chandler,Because you shouldn’t be with him.  You should be with me.,6,15
monica,Really?,6,15
chandler,"Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don’t just happen. you know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning you know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always you know with a friend.",6,15
monica,Chandler!,6,15
chandler,"I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, you know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a ""doctor…""",6,15

joey,you know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent! you know what’s even more generous than that?!!,6,17
chandler,I see where you’re going’!,6,17
ross,What’s up with the greed Joe?,6,17
joey,"All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I got to get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, you know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two because one of ‘them I kind of blackened in some teeth—Why did I do that?!",6,17
ross,"Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here?",6,17
phoebe,"Or, you know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you’ve got you know a little of this  going’ on. Wow! I still have it!",6,17
ross,"Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!",6,17

chandler,"Ah, finally an explanation.",6,17
joey,"No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again.  I really prefer doing that at the home office you know?  Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?",6,17
gunther,Joey!,6,17
joey,Yeah?,6,17
gunther,What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you’re working?,6,17

phoebe,OH! We went to a self-defence class today!,6,17
ross,Wow!,6,17
rachel,"Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of you!",6,17
joey,Takes it out of you?,6,17
phoebe,"Now, we can kick anybody’s ass!",6,17
rachel,Yeah!,6,17
ross,After one class? I don’t think so.,6,17
rachel,What? You want to see me self-defend myself?! Go over there  and pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare you!!,6,17
ross,"Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call  unagi.",6,17
rachel,Isn’t that a kind of sushi?,6,17
ross,"No, it’s a concept!",6,17
phoebe,Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!,6,17

ross,you know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!,6,17
phoebe,Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.,6,17
ross,Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!,6,17
phoebe,You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?,6,17
ross,"All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don’t know, like a  surprise!!",6,17
ross,"All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi.",6,17
rachel,"Ooh! you know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.",6,17
ross,you know what,6,17
chandler,"Hey-hey, is Monica here?",6,17
phoebe,No.,6,17
ross,No.,6,17
chandler,"Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.",6,17

chandler,She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re celebrating it tonight.,6,17
joey,"OH, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?",6,17
phoebe,"Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea!",6,17
joey,"And of course, crotchless panties.",6,17

rachel,"Aw, I love that.",6,17
phoebe,You guys!,6,17
joey,"You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut",6,17
rachel,"Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.",6,17
chandler,"Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.",6,17

ross,A lesson in the importance of unagi.,6,17
phoebe,"OH, you’re a freak!!",6,17
ross,"Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?",6,17
rachel,"All right, so we weren’t prepared!",6,17
ross,"I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I—look, I just want you guys to be safe.  DANGER!!!!!  Ah, huh? Unagi.",6,17

chandler,"Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.",6,17
ross,"Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.",6,17
chandler,"Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.",6,17
ross,Why not?,6,17
chandler,"Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom.",6,17

elizabeth,Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You’re a teacher. I’m a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?,6,18
ross,"Oh I, I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea.",6,18
elizabeth,"Oh, because I was thinking, the semester’s over; you’re not my teacher anymore.",6,18
ross,What time?,6,18
elizabeth,"Oh, you know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.",6,18
ross,Gotcha.,6,18
elizabeth,I’m kidding!,6,18
ross,"Oh! So-so seriously, what time?",6,18
phoebe,Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through!,6,18
monica,"Oh well, it’s not so bad.",6,18
fireman #1,"Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.",6,18
phoebe,Oh!,6,18
rachel,My God!,6,18
joey,"Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?",6,18
fireman #1,Excuse me?,6,18
monica,Joey! He’s working!  You would look good in that.,6,18
joey,"Oh, how bad is it?",6,18
phoebe,"Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!",6,18
chandler,How’s your room Rach?,6,18
rachel,Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favourite blue sweater.,6,18
monica,Isn’t that mine?,6,18
rachel,Fine! I’m sorry for your loss!,6,18
fireman #1,"So uh, you’re not going to be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?",6,18
rachel,"Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.",6,18
monica,"Yes, they can stay with us.",6,18
chandler,Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?,6,18
fireman #1,"Well uh, do either of you smoke?",6,18
phoebe,"No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.",6,18
fireman #1,"No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?",6,18
phoebe,Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!,6,18
rachel,"Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay?  I warned her about those candles.",6,18
chandler,"God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been!",6,18
joey,"Chandler, is that",6,18
chandler,Oh that’s great! Good for you.,6,18
joey,Hey-hey listen,6,18
chandler,"Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm…  Can you hold for one second please?  What?!",6,18
joey,"When you’re off the phone, do you want to get a pizza?",6,18
chandler,"Hi! I’m back.  Yeah, that sounds great.  Okay. Well, we’ll do it then.  Okay, bye-bye.",6,18
joey,"Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know it’s Thursday, but what time?",6,18
chandler,Hi.,6,18
monica,Hey!,6,18
chandler,We didn’t get to the audition. I’m going to take her to coffee and then we’ll do it then.,6,18
joey,Ah-ha!,6,18
monica,"Wow! So, now you’re going on a date with this girl?",6,18
chandler,"Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favour. There are rules, you know? You got to, you got to put in some time.",6,18
monica,"You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re you know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.",6,18
chandler,"No, we only went out once.",6,18
monica,You dated her!,6,18
chandler,Not once!,6,18
monica,"All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favour?!",6,18
joey,"Hey, you want to do Joey a favour, maybe you go out with Joey.",6,18
chandler,"Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the movie business.",6,18
dana,you know who I ran into from school? Howie.,6,18
chandler,My friend’s name is Joey.,6,18
dana,"Apparently Howie’s editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! you know I-I-I haven’t spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favour!",6,18
chandler,"Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie.",6,18
dana,"No, no ""How you doing?"" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!",6,18
chandler,The nerve huh?,6,18
dana,Yeah!,6,18
chandler,Refill?,6,18
monica,"Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?",6,18
rachel,Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.,6,18
monica,"I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.",6,18
phoebe,"Well, since the fire was kind of my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.",6,18
rachel,"Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.",6,18
phoebe,"Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.",6,18
rachel,Okay!,6,18
monica,"So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’ll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, you know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.",6,18
rachel,I have.,6,18
joey,This right here is where I keep the pizza.  And uh that’s where the napkin is.,6,18
phoebe,What’s that smell?,6,18
joey,I know!,6,18
elizabeth,Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!,6,18
ross,"What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.",6,18
elizabeth,Who?,6,18
ross,"Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kind of came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.",6,18
elizabeth,"Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?",6,18
ross,"Umm, no. No.",6,18
elizabeth,Yes you did! What was it?,6,18
ross,"Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty.",6,18
elizabeth,OH that’s so sweet!,6,18
ross,"Listen, I got to tell you, I-I’m having a great time! you know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all.",6,18
burt,Dr. Geller!,6,18
ross,Burt!,6,18
phoebe,So did you sleep well last night?,6,18
rachel,I did.,6,18
phoebe,Yeah?,6,18
rachel,"I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.",6,18
phoebe,you know what Joey left on my pillow?,6,18
rachel,What?,6,18
phoebe,Gum!,6,18
fireman #2,"Well, we determined the cause of the fire.",6,18
phoebe,"Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!",6,18
fireman #2,"No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It’s looks like a curling iron.",6,18
phoebe,I don’t use a curling iron.,6,18
fireman #2,Well someone does.,6,18
rachel,"Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!",6,18
fireman #2,It could’ve been a hair straightener.,6,18
rachel,Oh.,6,18
joey,This is where I keep the pizza.  And—Hey! Where did the napkin go?!,6,18
monica,Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!,6,18
phoebe,Thanks Monica!,6,18
monica,Does that smell bother you?,6,18
phoebe,"What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.",6,18
monica,"Well you let me know if you can, because you know I can bake a pie to cover it.",6,18
phoebe,"I can smell it a little, bake the pie.",6,18
monica,Okay!,6,18
phoebe,Okay.,6,18
monica,"Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  It’s for you. It’s the fire inspector.",6,18
phoebe,Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!,6,18
joey,"Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair straightener that started the fire.  No-no, it was the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is…  Uhh… Uhh… Okay. Well, I have to go now.",6,18
ross,"We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age.   A concept lost on some people!",6,18
monica,So it’s okay to date a student.,6,18
ross,"Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",6,18
monica,"Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as you know Professor McNailshisstudents.",6,18
ross,Yeah. What-what should I do?,6,18
joey,"Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you got to follow your heart.",6,18
monica,Joey that is so sweet.,6,18
chandler,Hey.,6,18
joey,"Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?",6,18
chandler,I couldn’t do it.,6,18
joey,You couldn’t do it?!,6,18
chandler,"Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.",6,18
monica,What?! You’re going out with her again!,6,18
ross,Going out with who?,6,18
chandler,"Uh, Dana Keystone from college.",6,18
ross,Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh,6,18
chandler,"No, that was Dana Caplin.",6,18
the guys,oh!,6,18
monica,Joey! You didn’t even know her!,6,18
joey,Ah whatever!,6,18
chandler,Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!,6,18
dana,"you know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.",6,18
chandler,Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!,6,18
dana,"Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don’t feel that way about you.",6,18
chandler,"Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!",6,18
dana,"I’m sorry Chandler, you know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don’t want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.",6,18
chandler,No-no—Really?!,6,18
dana,Of course!,6,18
chandler,"Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh",6,18
dana,"OH, I’m sorry.",6,18
chandler,Well maybe there is one thing you can do.,6,18
dana,What?! Anything! Anything!,6,18
chandler,"Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?",6,18
dana,Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?,6,18
chandler,"Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later.",6,18
monica,Hey! How’s it going’?,6,18
phoebe,"Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.",6,18
monica,Yes it has! I made cookies!,6,18
phoebe,Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips.,6,18
monica,But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven.,6,18
phoebe,Okay.,6,18
monica,"Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘them in bed, remember? No crumbies!",6,18
phoebe,"Okay, I’ll be out in a second.",6,18
monica,Okay!,6,18

phoebe,That doesn’t lock does it?,6,18
rachel,"Oh, Joey! Sorry!",6,18

elizabeth,"Uhh, I can’t.",6,18
ross,"Oh, you have some studying to do?",6,18
elizabeth,"No, I have some turning 21 to do.",6,18
ross,"you know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to",6,18
elizabeth,What are you doing?,6,18
ross,"Nothing, I’m-I’m just, I’m so comfortable with you!",6,18
elizabeth,Do you not want to be seen with me?,6,18
ross,"What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?",6,18
elizabeth,"Uh no, they’re still here but I think I’m about to leave.",6,18
ross,"What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on.  Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.",6,18
elizabeth,Hi!,6,18
lydia,Aren’t you in my Popular Culture class?,6,18
ross,"That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re dating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not going to hide it anymore.",6,18
mel,You are so fired.,6,18

phoebe,"Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!",6,18
rachel,Uh-huh.,6,18
phoebe,"Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so you know let’s just face it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at Joey’s.",6,18
rachel,"No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides you know what? I’m fine here.",6,18
phoebe,"Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.",6,18

elizabeth,For what it’s worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kind of made me like you even more.,6,18
ross,"I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden.",6,18

joey,"Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell you’?",6,19

ross,"That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re,  when you’re dead!",6,20
joey,"Ross, you don’t have to yell.",6,20
ross,"There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.",6,20
phoebe,"I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, ""Ooh, where’d Ross go?""",6,20
ross,Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac,6,20

joey,Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!,6,21
phoebe,"No! Joey, you’re going to be great!",6,21
joey,"But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don’t know anything about technology! I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn! And-and that’s only because it’s right there when you turn it on!",6,21
monica,I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.,6,21
phoebe,I’ll be waiting.,6,21
chandler,Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really not supposed to do that.,6,21
phoebe,"No, I’m just deciding which one to use—I’m going to start writing another book!",6,21
rachel,Be-because the last one was such a big seller?,6,21

joey,Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.,6,21
chandler,"Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our faithful servants!",6,21
joey,"Anyway, it wasn’t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn’t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! OH!",6,21
phoebe,"Well, why don’t you just get him fired?",6,21
joey,"I may have to, I hate to do it, but I’m the star! you know? There’s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.  Excuse me.  Joey Tribbiani.",6,21
estelle,"Joe! I’m glad I found you, I got an audition for you!",6,21
joey,Wow!,6,21

joey,I’m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!,6,21
estelle,Uh-oh!,6,21

rachel,"Ross, it’s okay. You can come out.",6,21
paul,"Yeah Ross it’s okay, it’s me, Mr. Stevens.",6,21
ross,Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you!,6,21
paul,"Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, ""Joey! Joey!"" Bye Rach.",6,21
rachel,Bye!,6,21
paul,I’ll call you later. Bye Ross.,6,21
ross,What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!,6,21
rachel,"Well, you know he lost his keys so he was looking for them",6,21
ross,In your mouth?!,6,21
rachel,"No! Downstairs! And we got to talking you know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.",6,21
ross,You were at the coffeehouse!,6,21
rachel,"Ross, what’s the big deal? So I kissed the guy!",6,21
ross,"He is my girlfriend’s father, okay? It’s-it’s, it’s weird!",6,21
rachel,Wh—You dated my sister!,6,21
ross,That was different!,6,21
rachel,What? Why?!,6,21
ross,This is weird for me!,6,21
rachel,"Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it, so far the guy’s not loving’ you! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, you know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!",6,21
ross,How is that important?,6,21
rachel,Oh it’s important!,6,21
joey,"Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?",6,21
monica,"Well you know Joey, you’re a pretty charming guy.",6,21
joey,"Thanks, but I kind of have a problem to deal with here.",6,21
monica,"No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!",6,21
joey,"That’s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.  Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.",6,21
chandler,"So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?",6,21
monica,Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.,6,21
chandler,"Yeah, you wish.",6,21
phoebe,"""You wish.""",6,21
monica,"Phoebe, stop writing about us!",6,21
phoebe,I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people.,6,21
chandler,Who?,6,21
phoebe,Marcia and Chester.,6,21
monica,"Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I’ll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!",6,21
chandler,Hmm.,6,21
monica,Phyllis is sitting in a chair.,6,21
chandler,Oh.,6,21
phoebe,I see what you’re doing!,6,21
monica,Phyllis sees what I’m doing.,6,21
chandler,Oh-oh.,6,21
phoebe,"Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!",6,21
joey,"Morning! Hey, how’s my favourite genius and my little robot buddy?!",6,21
wayne,Don’t touch him!,6,21
joey,"Okay!  All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumours that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy!  Ah-ah!!  Okay, that’s why you didn’t want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay?  Stupid! I can’t believe it! God!   Hey, how you doin’?",6,21
rachel,"So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.",6,21
elizabeth,What a nice story!,6,21
paul,So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.,6,21
rachel,Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m going to go to the bathroom.,6,21
ross,"Yeah, take your time.",6,21
ross,Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn’t as bad as-as,6,21
paul,"Ross, look, I know I’ve been giving you a lot of jabs and it’s partly because I’m very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many,  many stories that Rachel has told me that, well  you’re not  all bad.",6,21
ross,Not all bad.,6,21
paul,"And anyhow, I’m sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I  still look at Lizzie like she’s a twelve-year-old girl.",6,21
ross,Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.,6,21
paul,I beg your pardon?,6,21
ross,"No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby.",6,21
paul,You have a son?,6,21
ross,"Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your wife!  Oh, I’m sorry!  It’s unbelievable!",6,21
paul,"Don’t worry about it, I just didn’t realize you were married.",6,21
rachel,"Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.",6,21
ross,You’re back.,6,21
paul,You two were married?!,6,21
rachel,"Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry, you were talking about Emily!",6,21
monica,"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",6,21
chandler,We said seven!,6,21
monica,We said six!,6,21
chandler,"The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.",6,21
monica,"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!""",6,21
phoebe,Hi!,6,21
chandler,Oh my good God.,6,21
monica,Ugh!,6,21
phoebe,I know what time you said.,6,21
chandler,What?!,6,21
phoebe,"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",6,21
monica,What time?,6,21
phoebe,"Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it’s my book to the rescue, huh?  Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.",6,21
chandler,What does it say?!,6,21
phoebe,I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.,6,21
chandler,"Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.",6,21
phoebe,Thanks! So are you.,6,21
chandler,I told you I should not wear this colour.,6,21
phoebe,"Mon…  Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they’re supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it’s at seven.",6,21
chandler,So you knew we were going to miss the movie!,6,21
phoebe,That’s right.,6,21
monica,Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!,6,21
phoebe,Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.,6,21
joey,I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!,6,21
chandler,Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?,6,21
joey,Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.,6,21
wayne,"Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.",6,21
joey,"Yeah? Well, I don’t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.",6,21
chandler,"Hi, how are you?",6,21
wayne,"Joey, Joey, I-I-I’ll g-get you your job back if you help me out.",6,21
joey,Why should I help you?!,6,21
chandler,The reason he just said.,6,21
joey,What do you need?,6,21
wayne,"I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, you know Sarah?",6,21
joey,Yeah?,6,21
wayne,I wish I could talk to her.,6,21
joey,What are you in love with her or something?,6,21
wayne,Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.,6,21
chandler,"Yeah, I’ve been there my friend.",6,21
wayne,"Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.",6,21
joey,"Oh wow Wayne, it’s not really something you can teach you know? It’s pretty much something you’re born with if you——You-you can teach it! I’ll show you right how to do it.",6,21
rachel,"I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.",6,21
paul,How to make the next one even shorter?,6,21
rachel,"Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.  Maybe I have to pee again.",6,21
paul,"Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?",6,21
ross,"you know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! you know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly",6,21
paul,Are you yelling at me?!,6,21
ross,God no!,6,21
elizabeth,"you know what daddy? If you don’t like Ross, that’s fine. It doesn’t matter to me, I’m going to go out with him anyway.",6,21
paul,Really?!,6,21
ross,"Well if it doesn’t matter to her, it doesn’t matter to me!  Still not yelling!",6,21
paul,Wow. What can I say?  This doesn’t make me like you any better!,6,21
ross,"That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either.",6,21
paul,Then we agree?,6,21
ross,"Uh yeah, I guess—Yeah! I guess so.",6,21
paul,Neither of us like Ross!,6,21
elizabeth,I like Ross.,6,21
ross,oh! Kids!,6,21
rachel,"Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!",6,21
ross,"That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now.",6,21
rachel,Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too!,6,21
joey,"Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.",6,21
c.h.e.e.s.e.,The shipment never made it through Omaha?,6,21
joey,"You got it! And the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.!  It’s your line C.H.E.E.S.E.!  Wayne! Wayne!!",6,21
phoebe,"Hi, you guys.",6,22
chandler,Hey!,6,22
monica,Hi!,6,22
rachel,What’s the matter?,6,22
phoebe,Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just hate. you know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.,6,22
joey,Now you’re thinking you got to sleep with him.,6,22
phoebe,No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!,6,22
chandler,I’ll give up my ticket.,6,22
joey,Me too.,6,22
phoebe,Okay that’s so generous!,6,22
chandler,And I think Ross is generous too.,6,22
phoebe,Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!,6,22
monica and rachel,Great.,6,22
phoebe,Yeah.,6,22
rachel,So what-what is the exhibit.,6,22
phoebe,It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.,6,22
joey,Oh man!,6,22
ross,Hey!,6,22
rachel,Hi!,6,22
chandler,Hey!,6,22
joey,Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!,6,22
ross,Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.,6,22
monica,Oh that’s great!,6,22
ross,Yeah.,6,22
monica,I mean think about all the money that you’re going to make!,6,22
ross,Why? What?,6,22
monica,"Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?",6,22
ross,"No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, you know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh?",6,22
rachel,I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.,6,22
ross,"Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear.",6,22
chandler,Ross.,6,22
ross,"Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! you know? Because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide you know, ‘because because you know, because he’s all old, and",6,22
paul,"Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I’ve decided to accept the fact that you’re going out with her.",6,22
ross,"Really? That okay, that’s great.",6,22
paul,"Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I’m funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I’m telling you, I don’t want you seeing my daughter anymore.",6,22
ross,"All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.",6,22
paul,Yes it does.,6,22
ross,"But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.",6,22
paul,I’ll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.,6,22
ross,OH! A man with a plan!,6,22
phoebe,"Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!",6,22
joey,"I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be cracking’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I’ll",6,22
phoebe,"OH, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me.  Yeah I know; we’d be great together!",6,22
joey,Hey! So I’m back.,6,22
the dry cleaner,Who are you?,6,22
joey,"Joey Tribbiani! From the wall!  Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh?  Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a new TV show.",6,22
the dry cleaner,Show me in the table.,6,22
joey,"Oh well, it’s not on TV yet.",6,22
the dry cleaner,"Well, then it’s not on the wall yet.",6,22
joey,"Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?",6,22
phoebe,"So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet?",6,22
monica,"Oh, I love museums!",6,22
rachel,Umm.,6,22
monica,Soaking’ up all the culture.,6,22
rachel,Yeah.,6,22
monica,Where do you want to start?,6,22
rachel,"Ooh, the gift shop!",6,22
monica,Yeah!,6,22
phoebe,"Hey, and then lunch.",6,22
rachel,"Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.",6,22
phoebe,"Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s going to tell you that he’s gay?",6,22
rachel,What?! No! Why?!,6,22
phoebe,"No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?",6,22
the museum official,"You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.",6,22
rachel,I didn’t know you could get married here.,6,22
monica,"This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!  I mean you’d have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.",6,22
the museum official,May I help you?,6,22
rachel,Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?,6,22
the museum official,Yes. We’re very popular. There’s a two-year waiting list. Sorry!,6,22
rachel,"Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list",6,22
monica,What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged.,6,22
phoebe,"Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not going to wait that long. He’s going to find somebody else, you know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.",6,22
rachel,"Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.",6,22
monica,"Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.",6,22
rachel,I’m going to do it too!,6,22
phoebe,Me too!,6,22
rachel,"Really? Who would, who would you marry?",6,22
phoebe,"I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. you know?",6,22
rachel,Oh Pheebs.,6,22
phoebe,Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.,6,22
monica,"Phoebe, that stuff is",6,22
phoebe,Don’t even get me started on yours!,6,22
joey,"Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?",6,22
the dry cleaner,I did.,6,22
joey,"All right, let’s get me back up there!",6,22
the dry cleaner,No! It don’t go up on the wall!,6,22
joey,What—But you saw the show!,6,22
the dry cleaner,"Yes, it was very offensive to my people!",6,22
joey,Dry cleaners?,6,22
the dry cleaner,Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!,6,22
joey,"Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!",6,22
the dry cleaner,"That’s right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!",6,22
joey,"Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that’s offensive to Russians.",6,22
the dry cleaner,I’ve never seen it!,6,22
joey,"Oh you should, it’s great.",6,22
ross,This place is really beautiful!,6,22
elizabeth,"Yeah, I’ve been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma’s.",6,22
ross,"Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?",6,22
elizabeth,Sure!,6,22
elizabeth,Are you okay? What’s wrong?,6,22
ross,"Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.",6,22
elizabeth,"Well, whatever works for you",6,22
ross,"No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.",6,22
elizabeth,"Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it’s kind of fun hiding.",6,22
ross,Yeah.,6,22
elizabeth,"Hey umm, you brought protection right?",6,22
ross,"Why?! Are there like bears or something?!  OH. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.",6,22

chandler,"You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s, if you’re listening to this message, we’re probably screening.  Yeah we are.",6,22
the museum official,"Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I’m calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available",6,22
chandler,"This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groom—No! Not the groom!!",6,22

phoebe,"Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!",6,22
monica,I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him anywhere!,6,22
phoebe,What are you going to do?,6,22
monica,"Well, I’m never going to listen to you again, that’s for sure!  ""you know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?""",6,22
phoebe,Rachel said that!,6,22
monica,Well Rachel’s not here!,6,22
phoebe,"Oh! Here it is!  Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, ""Son of a bitch?""",6,22
joey,I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?!,6,22

elizabeth,Daddy!,6,22
paul,You’re next!!,6,22
elizabeth,Okay. I didn’t know he was here.,6,22
paul,"Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, ""Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!""",6,22
ross,"Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain",6,22
paul,"No, let me explain! Fired!!",6,22

ross,And I too am just a love machine.,6,22
paul,"Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.",6,22
monica,"I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.",6,22
chandler,"I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.",6,22
monica,"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?",6,22
chandler,Right here!,6,22
monica,"Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel",6,22
chandler,"Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!",6,22
monica,"It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.",6,22
chandler,Okay.,6,22
monica,Really?,6,22
chandler,"Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready",6,22
monica,I know! I know.,6,22
chandler,Okay.,6,22
monica,I’m going to go tell Joey that  that you’re back. I was really worried about you.,6,22
phoebe,"Hey, did she buy it?",6,22
chandler,Totally.,6,22
phoebe,So did Heldi show you the place?,6,22
chandler,"Yeah, it’s beautiful.",6,22
phoebe,I can’t believe you’re going to ask Monica to marry you!,6,22
chandler,I know.,6,22
joey,Hey Gunther.,6,22
gunther,Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there  wants the biscotti.,6,22
joey,"Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.",6,22
gunther,Do you still work here?,6,22
joey,"No! No, I quit a long time ago.  Did I forget to you that one? I’m sorry.",6,22
gunther,"Oh that’s cool, I was going to fire you anyway.",6,22
joey,Great!,6,22
chandler,"Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!",6,23
phoebe,"Now, have you told anyone else?",6,23
chandler,"No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.",6,23
phoebe,You told me.,6,23
chandler,"Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",6,23
phoebe,"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.",6,23
chandler,Me too.,6,23
joey,Hey.,6,23
chandler,Hey.,6,23
phoebe,"Hey! So Chandler, want to go to the coffeehouse?",6,23
chandler,Oh all right.,6,23
phoebe,"Yeah, coffeehouse.",6,23
ross,"Oh perfect, we were just going to see if you wanted to go.",6,23
chandler,"Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.",6,23
ross,How rude.,6,23
joey,"Oh, I’m sorry. You want to bite?",6,23
phoebe,So how are things going with Paul?,6,23
rachel,"Good. Although you know, he-he’s a private guy. you know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",6,23
phoebe,That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,6,23
rachel,So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?,6,23
phoebe,No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,6,23
paul,Hi honey.,6,23
rachel,Hi!,6,23
phoebe,Watch this.,6,23
paul,How are you?,6,23

paul,Good. Bye!,6,23
ross,Okay! You take care!,6,23
ross,"Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?",6,23
phoebe,"Yeah! That was so weird, huh?",6,23
ross,"Phoebe, why’d you do it?",6,23
phoebe,I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at you!,6,23
ross,What?! Why?!,6,23
phoebe,"Please, I think you know why.",6,23
ross,I can’t think of anything.,6,23
phoebe,"Come on Ross, you’re a palaeontologist, dig a little deeper.",6,23
ross,"Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?",6,23
phoebe,Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?,6,23
ross,I guess it could.,6,23
phoebe,Well then I think that’s it.,6,23
ross,"Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.",6,23
phoebe,"Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.",6,23
paul,"Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?",6,23
rachel,"Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.",6,23
paul,It was fine.,6,23
rachel,"Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?",6,23
paul,I’m thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.,6,23
rachel,"Yeah that’s great Paul, but you know I want to know what——Wow, those are really great! I just want to know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. you know they say that still waters run deep and I want to swim in yours.",6,23
paul,Are you talking about having sex?,6,23
rachel,"No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! you know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!",6,23
paul,Normal.,6,23
rachel,"Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! you know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.",6,23
paul,Nope! That never happened to me!,6,23
rachel,"Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm… The rest of you life, you know? Any regrets?",6,23
paul,Nope.,6,23
rachel,"All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!",6,23
paul,Okay.,6,23
rachel,Okay.,6,23
paul,Okay.,6,23
rachel,All right.,6,23
paul,When I was six years old.,6,23
rachel,Hm-mmm.,6,23
paul,I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.,6,23
rachel,"That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go.",6,23
paul,It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.,6,23
rachel,Oh!,6,23
paul,"And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn’t really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here  you can see it.",6,23
rachel,"Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that you know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?",6,23
paul,"Oh, I couldn’t eat now.",6,23
rachel,What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!,6,23
paul,Chicken?  Chicken boy!,6,23
rachel,"My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!",6,23
chandler,Nothing! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and I can’t find the perfect ring!  Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring!  It’s a beautiful selection.,6,23
phoebe,"Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. you know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, you know? Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! ",6,23
chandler,"you know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.",6,23
phoebe,Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?,6,23
chandler,"Yeah, I’m going to stick with the ring.  Oh, this one’s nice!  I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?",6,23
phoebe,"Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.",6,23
male jeweler,Can I help you?,6,23
chandler,"Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.",6,23
phoebe,"Or not, whatever.",6,23
male jeweler,"This ring is from the 1920s, it’s a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.",6,23
chandler,"Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?",6,23
male jeweler,Okay.  Will you marry me?,6,23
chandler,"Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much is it?",6,23
phoebe,"Chandler, I-I will handle this!  How much is it?",6,23
male jeweler,"8,600.",6,23
phoebe,We will give you $10.,6,23
male jeweler,Are you interested in this ring?!,6,23
chandler,"Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.",6,23
male jeweler,"Okay, I can let it go at eight.",6,23
phoebe,We stand firm at $10.,6,23
male jeweler,How would you like to pay?,6,23
chandler,"Uh, credit card.  Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey.  Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.",6,23
phoebe,"Okay.  Listen, I’m sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.",6,23
male jeweler,"Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.",6,23
phoebe,I’ll give you $1 for them.,6,23
ross,"Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?",6,23
joey,No.,6,23
ross,Remember? You-you were eating pizza.,6,23
joey,Yeah.,6,23
ross,"Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.",6,23
joey,"Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!",6,23
ross,"Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, you know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.",6,23
joey,Oh wow that’s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.,6,23
gunther,Here you go.,6,23
ross,Oh.,6,23
joey,"Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go.  you know I got to tell you, sometimes I just—I don’t get Chandler. you know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t get all upset.",6,23
ross,All the time?,6,23
joey,All the time!,6,23
rachel,Oh my God! Oh my God!!,6,23
monica,Still crying?,6,23
rachel,"Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn’t know that I was going to unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!",6,23
monica,"you know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.",6,23
rachel,What’s the other one?,6,23
monica,"I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’m just saying you know, if we’re having sex, he’s not going to be talking.",6,23
rachel,"Oh that’s right. You’re the talker.  Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I got to go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.",6,23
monica,"Oh, we have some",6,23
rachel,No you don’t!,6,23
phoebe,"Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara.  Oh yeah. Okay.   What do you think, too much?",6,23
male jeweler,A tad.,6,23
phoebe,"Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again.  Something’s missing. It’s not… Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.",6,23
male jeweler,Where’s the 1920s princess cut ring.,6,23
female jeweler,I just sold it to that gentleman.,6,23
phoebe,Oh my God!!  No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!,6,23
paul,Rachel?,6,23
chandler,No. How are you Paul?,6,23
paul,"Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?",6,23
chandler,"No, did he hug you?!",6,23
paul,"No! No! It’s just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.",6,23
chandler,"Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.",6,23
paul,Hey Chandler?,6,23
chandler,Yeah?,6,23
paul,Would you…….Would you hug me?,6,23
chandler,I’m a little busy here Paul.,6,23
paul,That’s exactly what my dad used to say!,6,23
chandler,"Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out.  Oh hey! There you go.  Okay.",6,23
paul,Five more seconds.,6,23
chandler,Okay!,6,23
joey,Hey!,6,23
paul,Joey!,6,23
joey,"Whoa-whoa-hey-hey!  Hi, Paul is it?",6,23
chandler,Do you have my credit card?,6,23
joey,"Yes, it’s in my… In…in my pocket.   My back pocket! My back pocket!",6,23
chandler,Thank God!,6,23
joey,Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.,6,23
chandler,"Oh, I can’t go.",6,23
joey,"Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and… Paul probably",6,23
phoebe,"Chandler, I found the perfect ring.",6,23
chandler,"Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m going to go with the one I picked first.",6,23
phoebe,"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!",6,23
chandler,What?,6,23
phoebe,Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!,6,23
chandler,They put you in jail?,6,23
phoebe,The little jail between the doors!,6,23
chandler,"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!",6,23
phoebe,"I know, I’m sorry! But you know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.",6,23
chandler,Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.,6,23
phoebe,Maybe it was the guy.,6,23
chandler,It was the ring!,6,23
ross,"Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?",6,23
joey,No! He blew us off!,6,23
ross,What?!,6,23
joey,I know!,6,23
ross,I can’t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.,6,23
joey,Can I tell you something? Me too.,6,23
ross,"you know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!",6,23
joey,Ooh! Freeze him out.,6,23
ross,That’s right!,6,23
joey,I like it!,6,23
ross,Eh? We’ll show him!,6,23
joey,"From now on, it’s going to be Joey and Ross, best friends.  Okay! We’re going to be the new Joey and Chandler.",6,23
rachel,Hi. I’m back.,6,23
paul,"Hey! I have so much more to tell you, I’ve written it all down!",6,23
rachel,"Ah that’s great. No actually that’s…  That’s great! That’s really great! you know, I got to tell you writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kind of hot.",6,23
paul,Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this!  you know what I wanted to be when I was that age?,6,23
rachel,A lover?,6,23
paul,A surfer.,6,23
rachel,Oh yeah surfer?,6,23
paul,"I wanted to be one with the waves, you know?",6,23
rachel,"Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh,  get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn’t too revealing is it?",6,23
paul,No. What ever happened to that little dude.  So full of dreams,6,23
rachel,"I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! you know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!",6,23
paul,What?! I can’t believe you’re trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!,6,23
rachel,Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.,6,23
paul,"Oh Rachel, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to overwhelm you. It’s just that, when those gates open, you…  Hard to close them. But they are closed now. Believe me.",6,23
rachel,"I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared.  And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm",6,23
paul,I would really like that.,6,23
paul,That was…so good.,6,23
phoebe,Hey.,6,23
chandler,I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!,6,23
phoebe,It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!,6,23
chandler,"No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, you know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.  Look, this is the most important thing I’m going to do in my life. I want to make sure it’s perfect.",6,23
phoebe,Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. Because I heard the guy tell the jeweller where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.,6,23
chandler,I can’t do that.,6,23
phoebe,Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.,6,23
phoebe,There he is!,6,23
chandler,Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.,6,23
phoebe,"Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes.",6,23
chandler,"Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.",6,23
phoebe,"Oh, okay.  Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.",6,23
customer,Who is it?,6,23
phoebe,It is your office.,6,23
customer,Do you know who at my office?,6,23
phoebe,John?,6,23
customer,Oh John! Great!,6,23
phoebe,Here he is.,6,23
chandler,"Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewellery store, the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I’m going to need to have that back.  But, in exchange I’m willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.  Ew.",6,23
phoebe,Wow! I would trade.,6,23
customer,"It is beautiful, but I’m going to use this one. Now, if you’ll excuse me.",6,23
chandler,No-no! This is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring. You don’t want to break her heart now do you?,6,23
phoebe,"Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?",6,23
customer,You’re dying?!,6,23
chandler,"Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.",6,23
phoebe,"Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity",6,23
chandler,"Okay, that’s enough honey!",6,23
customer,I don’t know.  Let me see the ring.,6,23
chandler,"Great! Okay, here.",6,23
customer,All right.,6,23
chandler,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And you are about to marry a wonderful man!  Hey! I’m marrying a dead woman!,6,23
chandler,Guys?  I’ve got something important to tell you.  Guys?  Guys?!  I’m going to ask Monica to marry me.,6,23
joey,I think we got to end the freeze out.,6,23
ross,"Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?",6,23
chandler,"Yeah, check out the ring.",6,23
joey,Oh my God!!,6,23
ross,So you two are really serious?!,6,23
chandler,"Yep, pretty much.",6,23
ross,You-you’re going to get married?! I mean… We’re going to be brothers-in-law!,6,23
joey,"And-and-and-and-and-and, and we’re going to be friends again!",6,23
chandler,Hey—What?,6,23
joey,"Oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it!",6,23
chandler,"Okay!  I was going to wait ‘til uh, it was official you know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my best friends.",6,23
joey,I think I’m going to cry!,6,23
rachel,"Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I’ll dump you too!",6,23
chandler,I’m going to ask Monica to marry me.,6,23
rachel,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!!  You guys are going to be so happy!,6,23

chandler,"Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right?  Guys? Guys?",6,23
ross,God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!,6,24
rachel,"Yeah? Well, you should know. You’ve bought like a billion of ‘them.",6,24
ross,"Yeah, you didn’t get one.",6,24
chandler,"Okay, well tonight’s the big night.",6,24
phoebe,Yeah!,6,24
joey,"Okay listen, how are you going to ask her?",6,24
chandler,"It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favourite restaurant. I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I’m just going to propose.",6,24
rachel,OH,6,24
joey,That sounds perfect!,6,24
chandler,Yeah.,6,24
joey,You’re going to mess it up let me do it.,6,24
chandler,I’m not going to mess it up.,6,24

ross,"Uh-uh—Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it.

mr. thompson,"And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman’s day sailor sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!",6,24
joey,I won! That was my guess!,6,24
rachel,What?! What?! What?!,6,24
joey,"I guessed 20,000!",6,24
rachel,"Joey! It is an auction! You don’t guess, you buy!",6,24
joey,"What?! I don’t have 20,000!",6,24
mr. thompson,"Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!",6,24
rachel,Joey! Sit down!,6,24
phoebe,Forget her! You enjoy this!!,6,24
monica,What are you doing?,6,24
chandler,"One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all.  I remembered it.  The champagne is here.",6,24
monica,Are you okay?,6,24
chandler,Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!,6,24
monica,"Yeah. I’m okay. I’m actually—I’m a little cold, can I have your jacket?",6,24
chandler,"Oh, yeah.  Uh, no you can’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?",6,24
monica,Are you sure you’re okay?,6,24
chandler,"Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.",6,24
monica,OH that’s sweet!,6,24
chandler,"Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn’t imagine growing old with",6,24
monica,Oh my God!,6,24
chandler,"I know, but just let me say it.",6,24
monica,"Oh my God, Richard.",6,24
chandler,"What?! I’m Chandler!  Oh, that’s Richard!",6,24
monica,"Oh God, maybe he won’t see us. Richard!",6,24
richard,Monica! Chandler!,6,24
chandler,"Hey-hey, hey!  I don’t know why I did that!",6,24
monica,"Hey, it’s good to see you!",6,24
richard,"You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.",6,24
monica,"Yeah—Oh that’s right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your moustache back.",6,24
richard,"Well, my nose got lonely.",6,24
chandler,"And uh, you don’t have a moustache which is good.  I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable.",6,24
lisa,"Hi, I’m Lisa.",6,24
chandler,Hi.,6,24
richard,"Oh, I’m sorry.  Lisa,  Monica, Chandler. We used to date.",6,24
chandler,"Richard! No one supposed to know about us!  See I, did it again.",6,24
monica,"Chandler, wh-why don’t we sit down?",6,24
chandler,"Yeah, I’ll sit down.",6,24
monica,It’s good to see you,6,24
matire'd,You’re table’s ready sir.,6,24
richard,Oh. Good to see you guys.,6,24
chandler,Yes.,6,24
matire'd,"Or if you prefer, this table is available.",6,24
richard,That might be fun.,6,24
rachel,What were you thinking?!,6,24
joey,I didn’t know it was an auction!,6,24
rachel,Wh?!,6,24
joey,"I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!",6,24
rachel,Why would a charity give away a free boat?!,6,24
joey,I don’t know! Charity?,6,24
rachel,Ugh!,6,24
phoebe,"Well, just buy the damn boat!",6,24
rachel,"Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?",6,24
phoebe,I’m just helping the kids!,6,24
rachel,How is you drinking helping the kids?,6,24
phoebe,"Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.",6,24
mr. thompson,Mr. Tribbiani.,6,24
joey,Oh hi!,6,24
mr. thompson,Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth centre.,6,24
joey,"Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?",6,24
mr. thompson,"I think it was valued at 19,000",6,24
joey,"Hey, I was pretty close.  Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can’t buy the boat, I don’t have any money.",6,24
rachel,"Joey! Joey, good one!",6,24
mr. thompson,That’s good. Very good!,6,24
joey,"So uh listen, I think I’m going to take off now.",6,24
rachel,"Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is going to kill me!",6,24
joey,"Well, what am I going to do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money!",6,24
rachel,"I know. Okay.  Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we’re going to do, we are going to go to the next highest bidder, and we are just going to let them buy it, and then you’re just going to pay the difference.",6,24
joey,Okay.,6,24
rachel,Okay.,6,24
joey,"Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth centre anyway! you know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!",6,24
rachel,Not great.,6,24
monica,"And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom.",6,24
richard,And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.,6,24
monica,So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor.,6,24
lisa,Oh my God!,6,24
chandler,"I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.",6,24
richard,"It’s so great seeing you guys again. I’d like to make a toast.  Uh, as a poet once said, ""In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it’s morning and is refreshed.""",6,24
monica,OH.,6,24
chandler,What?!,6,24
ross,"Oh my God, you guys!!",6,24
chandler,"Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!",6,24
ross,Who?,6,24
chandler,Richard!,6,24
ross,What?  A-oh!  OH. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favourite place too.,6,24
chandler,Oh you knew that. Good!,6,24
monica,I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.,6,24
ross,"Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.",6,24
monica,"Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get out of!",6,24
ross,"you know, maybe she is too young for me. you know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do.",6,24
monica,Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first  weighing stuff.,6,24
ross,"Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is.",6,24
monica,If the school finds out you’re fired.,6,24
ross,Hmm.,6,24
monica,She’s leaving for three months.,6,24
chandler,For camp!,6,24
ross,"Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and",6,24
monica,"Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, ""Do you see a future?"" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her?  Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn’t you?!",6,24
ross,"No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay, honestly no. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her.",6,24
monica,Okay well I think…that’s your answer.,6,24
ross,"I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.",6,24
chandler,"Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!",6,24
joey,"Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.",6,24
rachel,Oh great!,6,24
joey,Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.,6,24
phoebe,"Oh, okay.",6,24
rachel,Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?,6,24
phoebe,"It’s a trip for two!  Excuse me.  Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?",6,24
emil alexander,That was me.,6,24
phoebe,"Oh, en chante.",6,24
joey,"Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?",6,24
mr. bowmont,That’s me.,6,24
joey,"Ahh, yes.",6,24
rachel,"Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailor as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.",6,24
joey,You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess.,6,24
rachel,Okay. Okay.,6,24
mr. bowmont,I was actually relieved uh I didn’t win the boat. My wife would’ve killed me.,6,24
rachel,OH,6,24
joey,Are you kidding me?! She’s going to this boat!,6,24
rachel,Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?,6,24
mr. bowmont,It’s Pam.,6,24
rachel,"Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, ""The Pam.""",6,24
joey,Aw-aww!,6,24
mr. bowmont,I don’t think she’d like that.,6,24
rachel,"Okay, uh-uh imagine this, ""The Mr. Bowmont.""",6,24
joey,Ooh,6,24
mr. bowmont,I don’t think so dear.,6,24
rachel,"Okay look, let me paint you a little picture.  All right, you are setting’ sail up the Hudson! You’ve got the wind in your h——arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishing’! You can—ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you’re old, Cappy.",6,24
mr. bowmont,"What the hell, it’s for a good cause! All right!",6,24
joey,No way! It’s mine!!,6,24
rachel,What?! What?!,6,24
joey,All that stuff you just said? I want that!,6,24
rachel,"But Joey you don’t have $20,000!",6,24
joey,"Who cares?! I-I’ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!",6,24
joey,"Oh my God, you’re back!",6,24
phoebe,"OH, let me see it! Let me see your hand!",6,24
monica,Why do you want to see my hand?,6,24
phoebe,I want to see what’s in your hand. I want to see the trash.,6,24
joey,Yeah.,6,24
phoebe,"Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out.",6,24
monica,Okay.,6,24
chandler,What did you guys just do?!,6,24
phoebe,What happened?,6,24
chandler,Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!,6,24
joey,What?! No,6,24
chandler,"I’m going to do it tomorrow you know, and-and surprise her, but now you’ve ruined it!",6,24
joey,We didn’t ruin it!,6,24
chandler,Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!,6,24
phoebe,"Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor",6,24
joey,Glove salesman!,6,24
phoebe,Good one! Yeah.,6,24
chandler,This is terrible. What am I going to do?,6,24
phoebe,"Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.",6,24
chandler,"That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.",6,24
phoebe,Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward!,6,24
chandler,"I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice.",6,24
joey,"Hey, being you is finally going to pay off!",6,24
monica,I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!,6,24
joey,That guy’s still doing that?!,6,24
rachel,"Hey!  Oh my God you’re here, let me see your hand!!",6,24
phoebe,"No, you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!",6,24
ross,Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?,6,24
elizabeth,Ross! Wait!,6,24
ross,"Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about",6,24
elizabeth,You suck!!,6,24
ross,What?!,6,24
ross,"Okay, break-up’s still on!",6,24
chandler,"Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?",6,24
joey,"Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.",6,24
monica,Hi guys!,6,24
joey,Hey!,6,24
chandler,Hey!,6,24
monica,What are you up too?,6,24
chandler,"Oh, just hanging out, talking’ about uh, websites.  Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.",6,24
joey,"Yeah, Big Brother.",6,24
monica,Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am you know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.,6,24
chandler,"Yeah, well… you know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?",6,24
monica,Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!,6,24
chandler,Eh,6,24
monica,Okay well that’s good to know.,6,24
joey,The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!!,6,24
waitress,"Hey Monica, there’s a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?",6,24
monica,"Sure, I love this part!",6,24
waitress,Come on in.,6,24
richard,Hi!,6,24
monica,Richard!,6,24
richard,"Actually, I’m not here to complement the chef.",6,24
monica,"OH… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up?",6,24
richard,"Well, it was great seeing you the other night.",6,24
monica,"Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?",6,24
richard,No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you.,6,24
monica,What uh—What did you—What?!,6,24
richard,"I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn’t even be here telling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he’s straight I’ll believe you! After seeing you the other night I knew if I didn’t tell you I’d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.",6,24
monica,you know you’re really not supposed to be back here!,6,24
richard,"Well yeah, I’m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell you! I want to spend my life with you. I want to marry you. I want to have kids with you.",6,24
monica,Oh God…  Why don’t they put chairs back here?!,6,24
richard,I know this is crazy but am I too late?,6,24
monica,What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?!,6,24
richard,"Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! you know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!",6,24
monica,What were you doing in Africa?,6,24
richard,Working with blind kids.,6,24
monica,"oh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.",6,24
richard,"Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away. And I’ll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler’s willing to give you everything I am.",6,24
monica,"Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!",6,24
richard,You are?,6,24
monica,Yeah!,6,24
richard,Why?,6,24
monica,Why? Because of the government.,6,24
rachel,"Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, getting’ married.",6,24
phoebe,"I know, they’re going to be so happy together.",6,24
rachel,"OH… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?",6,24
phoebe,Not that often!,6,24
rachel,No! I’m so happy for them!,6,24
phoebe,Me too! So happy for them!,6,24
rachel,I’m so happy and not at all jealous.,6,24
phoebe,"Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!",6,24
rachel,"I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.",6,24
phoebe,Totally. I’m like 90/10.,6,24
rachel,Yeah me too.,6,24
joey,"Hey uh, have you guys seen Chandler?",6,24
rachel,"Wh—no, but you know who did stop in here looking for you, Tennille.",6,24
monica,"So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you?",6,24
chandler,"Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!",6,24
monica,"Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!",6,24
chandler,"If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.",6,24
monica,Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?,6,24
chandler,"Well, never say never but you know probably uh yeah, never.",6,24
monica,Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!,6,24
chandler,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!,6,24
monica,you know what?! I got to go! Ugh!,6,24
chandler,"It’s okay, I got a plan.",6,24
rachel,We’re going to find love!,6,24
phoebe,Definitely!,6,24
rachel,"Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.",6,24
phoebe,What do you mean?,6,24
rachel,"Well you know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.",6,24
phoebe,You mean a backup?,6,24
rachel,Exactly!,6,24
phoebe,"Yeah, yeah I got that.",6,24
rachel,You do?,6,24
phoebe,Hm-mmm.,6,24
rachel,Who?,6,24
phoebe,Joey.,6,24
rachel,Joey?!,6,24
phoebe,Yeah!,6,24
rachel,Are you serious?!,6,24
phoebe,"Yeah, I locked him years ago!",6,24
rachel,"Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re going to marry Joey.",6,24
phoebe,"Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.",6,24
rachel,"Oh, seriously?",6,24
phoebe,"OH, yeah. I think his exact words were",6,24
rachel,Charming.,6,24
phoebe,"Well hey, it’s just a backup.",6,24
rachel,Yeah.,6,24
joey,Hey Monica!,6,24
monica,Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?,6,24
joey,"This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?",6,24
monica,"Yeah, it’s great.",6,24
joey,"Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!",6,24
monica,I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship!,6,24
joey,Chandler giving you a hard time huh?,6,24
monica,"It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!",6,24
joey,"Well, you know Chandler.",6,24
monica,No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed.,6,24
joey,Maybe you changed?,6,24
monica,I didn’t change!,6,24
joey,Maybe that’s the problem.,6,24
monica,What?!,6,24
joey,"Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.",6,24
monica,Is that some kind of boat talk?,6,24
joey,I don’t know!  I haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.,6,24
monica,What does he think? Does he think I’m just going to wait around for nothing?,6,24
joey,"Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!",6,24
monica,Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.,6,24
joey,There are?,6,24
monica,Yeah! Richard!,6,24
joey,R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandler’s telling’ you how much he hates marriage?!,6,24
monica,That’s right.,6,24
joey,Chandler loves marriage!!,6,24
monica,You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!,6,24
joey,You got that from what I said?!,6,24
narrator,"When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.",6,24
ross,What happened you guys?,6,24
ross,Rach!,6,24
rachel,Hey you!,6,24
ross,"Hey, come on in.",6,24
rachel,"Oh thank you. Hey you know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.",6,24
ross,"Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.",6,24
rachel,"Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?",6,24
ross,I guess so.,6,24
rachel,"So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so you know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, ""What’s that?!""",6,24
ross,Right. OH! You-you want me to be your backup.,6,24
rachel,Exactly.,6,24
ross,"OH, yeah I already have one.",6,24
rachel,What? Who?,6,24
ross,Phoebe.,6,24
rachel,"Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.",6,24
ross,"OH, I don’t think so.",6,24
rachel,"Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!",6,24
ross,"That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.",6,24
joey,Where the hell have you been?!,6,24
chandler,I was making a coconut phone with the professor.,6,24
joey,Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!,6,24
chandler,What?!,6,24
joey,"Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find you to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off!",6,24
chandler,My—Oh my God!,6,24
joey,I know! They suck!!,6,24
chandler,He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that!,6,24
joey,I know!,6,24
chandler,Well what… you know what I’m going to do? I’m going to go over there; I’m going to kick his ass!  Will you help me?!,6,24
joey,"Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!",6,24
chandler,You’re right.,6,24
joey,Yeah!,6,24
chandler,Okay.  I’m going to get the ring! I’m going to get the ring!  I’m going to go find her and  I’m just going to propose!,6,24
joey,Okay.,6,24
chandler,Okay great.,6,24
joey,Dude-dude-dude!,6,24
chandler,What?!,6,24
joey,"Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.",6,24
monica,Hi.,6,24
richard,Hi.,6,24
monica,I don’t know why I’m here.,6,24
richard,I didn’t ask. You want to come in?,6,24
monica,I don’t know.,6,24
richard,"Oh, okay. Well, I’ll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.",6,24
monica,Chandler is such an idiot!,6,24
richard,Drink?,6,24
monica,"Yeah, I’ll have a scotch",6,24
richard,on the rocks with a twist? I remember.,6,24
monica,Still smoking cigars?,6,24
richard,"Uh, no! No! That’s…art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.",6,24
monica,"No that’s, that’s okay.",6,24
richard,"So Monica let me ask you a question. you know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?",6,24
monica,"Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.",6,24
richard,Oh really?,6,24
monica,Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor.,6,24
richard,Who is it?,6,24
monica,Edward Nevski?,6,24
richard,Yeah he’s no good. Do you ever  think about me in a  non-eye doctor way?,6,24
monica,No.,6,24
richard,Ahh.,6,24
monica,But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.,6,24
rachel,Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!,6,24
phoebe,"Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I’ve already lost Chandler!",6,24
rachel,What?!,6,24
joey,Hey!,6,24
ross,Hey!,6,24
joey,Phoebe! We’re both  your backup?!,6,24
ross,"Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!",6,24
phoebe,I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!,6,24
joey,No we weren’t!,6,24
ross,I was not!,6,24
phoebe,"Okay, this kind of back talk is not going to fly when we’re married!",6,24
rachel,Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!,6,24
joey,Pick me!!,6,24
ross,No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!,6,24
phoebe,"All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat—This is hard!",6,24
joey,"This is crazy! Hey look, I want to switch to Rachel!",6,24
ross,"Ooh, I want to switch to Rachel too!",6,24
phoebe,"No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.",6,24
rachel,"Oh God, Phoebe!",6,24
phoebe,I’m talking about massages.,6,24
rachel,Oh.,6,24
rachel,"Okay, you know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we’re going to do! I’m going to write Joey on one napkin  and I’m going to right Ross on the other napkin  and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?",6,24
joey,Okay that’s fair.,6,24
ross,All right.,6,24
phoebe,Good!,6,24
rachel,Pick one.,6,24
phoebe,Left!  Thank you.,6,24
rachel,You’re welcome.,6,24
phoebe,Ross!,6,24
rachel,Joey!  We should just switch.,6,24

monica,"I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!",6,24
richard,Excuse me?,6,24
monica,Oh!  Him.,6,24
richard,Oh.  Whew!,6,24
monica,"I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up’s apartment! you know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!",6,24
richard,"Yeah! You’re saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a moustache.",6,24
monica,"you know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don’t want that!",6,24
richard,I think that’s fair.,6,24
monica,"Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!",6,24
richard,It’s okay! Shh! Hey. Hey.  Shh.,6,24
monica,Nothing.  I don’t kn—Umm. I don’t know. Umm,6,24
richard,I know.,6,24
monica,"you know, I-I… I have to figure…some st—you know, some stuff before I can",6,24
richard,"Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want.  Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I’ll be here. Not smoking.",6,24
richard,Chandler.,6,24
chandler,Where is she? I’m not scared of you!,6,24
richard,She’s not here and please come in.,6,24
chandler,"Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!",6,24
richard,"Okay, she was here, but she left.",6,24
chandler,Well where did she go?,6,24
richard,Well she said she had to think things over.,6,24
chandler,"Oh my God, I can’t believe this! you know, I thought…I thought you were a good guy.",6,24
richard,"Oh, hey look nothing happened.",6,24
chandler,Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?,6,24
richard,"Well all right, one thing happened?",6,24
chandler,you know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!,6,24
richard,Well I’m sorry.,6,24
chandler,And what does she have to think about? I love her!,6,24
richard,"Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not.",6,24
chandler,"But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, you know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!",6,24
richard,"Well if it helps, it worked very well.",6,24
chandler,"It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake!  I was going to propose tonight.",6,24
richard,You were going to propose?,6,24
chandler,Yeah I even  got a ring.  Did you get a ring?,6,24
richard,"No I don’t have a ring!  You go get her Chandler.  And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don’t let her go. Trust me.",6,24
chandler,you know Richard…you are a good guy.,6,24
richard,I know.  I hate that!,6,24
joey,Dude!,6,24
chandler,"I can’t talk to you now, I got to find Monica!",6,24
joey,She’s gone.,6,24
chandler,What?,6,24
joey,She’s gone. She had a bag and she left.,6,24
chandler,What are you talking about?,6,24
joey,"She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.",6,24
chandler,Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!,6,24
joey,"I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me.",6,24
chandler,Well where… Where did she go?,6,24
joey,To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would.,6,24
chandler,I can’t believe I ruined this.,6,24
joey,I am so sorry man.,6,24
monica,You wanted it to be a surprise.,6,24
chandler,Oh my God.,6,24
monica,Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.  As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!,6,24
chandler,"Okay!  Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought…  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me?",6,24
monica,Yes.,6,24

ross,Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!,7,1
joey,Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!,7,1
chandler,I don't think that is what they were talking about Joe!!,7,1
phoebe,"What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...",7,1

chandler,What?!,7,1
joey,You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!,7,1
rachel,No!,7,1
ross,Oh no!,7,1
rachel,"No-no, it's really not huge.",7,1
ross,And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!,7,1
monica,"Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?",7,1
phoebe,"Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.",7,1
joey,"Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.",7,1
monica,Yes that would be lovely.,7,1
joey,"You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!",7,1
chandler,"Yes, you can pass for 19.",7,1
joey,Really?,7,1

chandler,"Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!",7,1
joey,I'm 30!,7,1
rachel,"Joey, you are not! you are 31.",7,1
joey,Aww crap!,7,1
phoebe,"Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's,  maybe no more for you though.",7,1
monica,"You know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.",7,1
phoebe,Why?!,7,1
rachel,"Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...",7,1
monica,"No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't!  Especially with you.",7,1
joey,"Psss, that is whack!",7,1
phoebe,"Yeah?  Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.",7,1
joey,"Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, ""You look 19,"" and then they just take it away like-like, ""No you don't.""",7,1
phoebe,"Well, I don't think Monica is going to take this away.",7,1
joey,Wouldn't she?,7,1
phoebe,Would she?,7,1
joey,Would she?  You ate my candy bar!,7,1
ross,Guess who?,7,1
rachel,Hey.,7,1
ross,"Hey, I just realized we kind of let some stuff up in the air...",7,1
rachel,"What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.",7,1
ross,Still thinking about it huh?,7,1
rachel,"Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?  Especially you!",7,1
ross,"Oh, who cares?",7,1
rachel,I care!,7,1
ross,And so do I.,7,1
rachel,"You know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?",7,1
ross,Okay. Sure.,7,1
rachel,Am I going to let you watch me undress?,7,1
ross,No!,7,1
monica,"I can't believe her, you know it's just-it's so typical.",7,1
chandler,"Now Monica, I know you are upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.",7,1
monica,Paris?,7,1
chandler,We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .,7,1
monica,Keep talking.,7,1
chandler,"Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!",7,1
monica,I love you!,7,1
monica,"Bonjour, monsieur.",7,1
chandler,"Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.",7,1
chandler,"It's Paris, who knows we're here!",7,1
monica,"Hi Pheebs, what's up?",7,1
phoebe,"Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just going to need a small deposit.",7,1
monica,What?!,7,1
phoebe,"You know, just some good faith money to hold the date.",7,1
chandler,"Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!",7,1
phoebe,"Oh, I see.",7,1
joey,"They break your heart, don't they?",7,1
phoebe,"You know, I don't really their permission.",7,1
joey,"Yeah! If you want to sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!",7,1
phoebe,"Yeah! And if you want to look 19, then you... You got to do something about your eyes.",7,1
joey,What?! What's wrong with my eyes.,7,1
phoebe,They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there.  Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.,7,1
joey,And that'll get rid of my wisdom?,7,1
phoebe,Maybe just 10 minutes for you.,7,1
chandler,"Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!",7,1
monica,Yes.,7,1
rachel,"Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?",7,1
chandler,"What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!",7,1
rachel,"No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?",7,1
monica,"Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.",7,1
rachel,What?!,7,1
ross,"Hey, here's a thought.",7,1
rachel,"Monica, what are you talking about?",7,1
monica,"My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.",7,1
chandler,"Ahh, third base.",7,1
monica,It's all everybody at the party could talk about!,7,1
rachel,"Monica, you know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!",7,1
monica,We had a caricaturist!,7,1
rachel,Oh!!,7,1
phoebe,,7,1
rachel,"Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.",7,1
monica,"And yet, here we are doing it again.",7,1
rachel,"Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!",7,1
monica,Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!,7,1
ross,Got me.,7,1
rachel,"All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it isn't going to happen!",7,1
monica,I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!,7,1
rachel,"I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!",7,1
monica,"Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!",7,1
ross,"Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.",7,1
chandler,Why to save your dignity my man.,7,1
rachel,"Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?",7,1
monica,"I don't know! I don't-maybe you are feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!",7,1
rachel,"Oh wow. That-You know what? That is so unfair. You know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!",7,1
monica,I can't believe you are going to have sex on my engagement night!!,7,1
chandler,"Well, somebody should.",7,1
ross,"Look uh, if we're going to do this...",7,1
rachel,"We're not going to do this, all right? She's just going to think that we're doin' it.",7,1
ross,"Oh, I see, so everybody wins.",7,1
rachel,Who is it?,7,1
monica,"It's Monica, open up!",7,1
rachel,Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!,7,1
ross,Oww!,7,1
rachel,"Yeah, you like that baby?  May we help you?",7,1
monica,"I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!",7,1
chandler,How is that ever going to happen?!,7,1
rachel,"All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!",7,1
monica,I know why!,7,1
rachel,No you don't know why!,7,1
monica,Okay! Why?!,7,1
rachel,Because! Because I was sad.,7,1
monica,What do you mean?,7,1
rachel,"Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that is dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!",7,1
chandler,"I don't care, she slept with me.",7,1
rachel,"Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.",7,1
monica,I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.,7,1
ross,"Well, I'm going to take off.  Congratulations man.",7,1
chandler,Thanks.,7,1
ross,"And uh, Rachel.",7,1
rachel,Yeah.,7,1
ross,"What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys  is me.",7,1
phoebe,,7,1
chandler,"Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.",7,1
phoebe,Oh thank you.,7,1
chandler,Okay.,7,1
phoebe,"Now...  ""Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer--Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning.",7,1
joey,Hey!,7,2
ross,Hi!,7,2
joey,Who wants French toast?,7,2
ross,"Oh, I'll have some!",7,2
joey,"Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.",7,2
monica,Oww!,7,2
chandler,What's the matter honey?,7,2
monica,"I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged!  How long before it starts getting annoying?",7,2
phoebe,It starts?,7,2
rachel,"Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!",7,2
monica,Okay!,7,2
chandler,Already?!,7,2
rachel,"Yeah, we got a lot to do! We got to think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...",7,2
chandler,"Oh, I got some thoughts on that.",7,2
rachel,"Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...",7,2
ross,"Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.",7,2
monica,Okay!,7,2
chandler,What in God's name is that?!,7,2
ross,"Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!",7,2
monica,"This baby has got everything. Take you know, locations for instance.  First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.",7,2
phoebe,That is so smart!  Break it off. Break it off now.,7,2
ross,And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at...,7,2
phoebe,Hey! Ross!,7,2
ross,"Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?",7,2
phoebe,"I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.",7,2
ross,"Oh my God! Of course, of course.  Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you...   Wh-what's going on?",7,2
phoebe,"Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, you know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?",7,2
ross,"Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?",7,2
phoebe,Nothing-Why?!,7,2
ross,"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!",7,2
phoebe,Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.,7,2
ross,Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?,7,2
phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?",7,2
monica,"All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.",7,2
rachel,Okay.,7,2
monica,"All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.",7,2
rachel,Aw.,7,2
monica,"A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.",7,2
chandler,"Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick...  And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.",7,2
joey,"Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? you know, something a little snugglyer?",7,2
chandler,Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?,7,2
joey,"Well, the duck...",7,2
rachel,What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!,7,2
joey,"Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!",7,2
chandler,"Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?",7,2
monica,"Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!",7,2
chandler,Okay.,7,2
monica,Here you go! What do you think about centrepieces?,7,2
chandler,Centrepieces!,7,2
monica,Yeah! Roses or Lilies?,7,2
chandler,"Definitely roses.  Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy.  But Lilies are the clear choice.",7,2
monica,Oh my God! It's like one mind.,7,2
chandler,Uh-huh!,7,2
joey,"Guys! Guys!! You got to let me nap! Ugh, I'm going to get cranky!",7,2
rachel,"Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!",7,2
joey,"Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!",7,2
rachel,What?!,7,2
joey,"All right, I'm going to go!",7,2
rachel,"Now Joey, what did the duck do?!",7,2
joey,I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!,7,2
joey,"Hey little buddy, how are you feeling?  What the hell is in that face cream?  that is so soft.  Pillowcases!   Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar?  ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa!  Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!",7,2
ross,"Uh, Phoebe...",7,2
phoebe,"Oh Ross, hi.",7,2
ross,"Phoebe, what are you doing?",7,2
phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.",7,2
ross,Phoebe!,7,2
phoebe,"Okay, let's talk outside.",7,2
ross,"Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!",7,2
phoebe,What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!,7,2
ross,And they knew about it?,7,2
phoebe,"Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?",7,2
ross,"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!",7,2
phoebe,"Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!",7,2
ross,"The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.",7,2
rachel,"Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?",7,2
joey,Sweeping'. Why? Turn you on?,7,2
rachel,No.,7,2
joey,Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?,7,2
rachel,"Joey, did you my face cream?",7,2
joey,Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.,7,2
rachel,"Joey,  where did you learn that word?",7,2
joey,"Where do you think,  Zelda?",7,2
rachel,You found my book?!,7,2
joey,Yeah I did!,7,2
rachel,"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!",7,2
joey,"Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!",7,2
rachel,"Hey-hey, you know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.",7,2
joey,You got porn!,7,2
ross,Hello.,7,2
woman,"Hi, is uh Phoebe here?",7,2
ross,"Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.",7,2
woman,OH great.,7,2
ross,"Can I, can I help you with something?",7,2
woman,"Well, I don't know. Are you a masseur?",7,2
ross,Yes I am.,7,2
woman,"Great!  Dad!  Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.",7,2
mrs. geller,"So Chandler, you are parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.",7,2
chandler,"Oh yeah, I should probably call them.",7,2
mr. geller,I remember when we first got engaged.,7,2
chandler,"Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.",7,2
monica,"Oh dad, really you don't need to...",7,2
mr. geller,"Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.",7,2
mrs. geller,You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!,7,2
chandler,What a sweet story.,7,2
monica,"Well, at least you are not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.",7,2
mr. geller,What?! They wanted a scary story!,7,2
monica,"Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.  What?",7,2
mrs. geller,"You tell her Jack, I can't do it.",7,2
monica,What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?,7,2
mr. geller,"We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.",7,2
monica,I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!,7,2
mrs. geller,"We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.",7,2
monica,You bought the beach house when I was 23!,7,2
mr. geller,Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.,7,2
mrs. geller,We really do feel bad about this though.,7,2
mr. geller,"We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.",7,2
monica,What about when I started dating Chandler?,7,2
mrs. geller,Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!,7,2
chandler,Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.,7,2
monica,I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!,7,2
mrs. geller,"We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.",7,2
mr. geller,It seemed like such a simple idea.,7,2
mrs. geller,"Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.",7,2
mr. geller,"All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore!  Good luck, Chandler.",7,2
ross,"Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you.  OH, that is soft.",7,2
monica,I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?,7,2
chandler,"I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood.",7,2
rachel,Well what happened at dinner?,7,2
monica,My parents spent the money for our wedding!,7,2
phoebe,My God! What did you order?!,7,2
rachel,"Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are going to have to get married in like a, rec. centre!",7,2
chandler,"Honey, it's going to be okay.",7,2
monica,No! No it's not! It's not going to be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,7,2
rachel,"No, you know what? It's going to be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. You know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.",7,2
chandler,"Look, it really is going to be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're going to get married.",7,2
rachel,Do you even understand what off the rack means?!,7,2
phoebe,"Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?",7,2
monica,How? I don't have any money.,7,2
chandler,"Well, I have some.",7,2
monica,How much?,7,2
chandler,"Well, close to...",7,2
monica,Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!,7,2
rachel,Well what?! How-how much is it?!,7,2
monica,It's enough for wedding scenario eight.,7,2
rachel,OH!  Really?!,7,2
monica,"How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!",7,2
rachel,"OH, you guys are so made for each other.",7,2
chandler,"Well, you are not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?",7,2
rachel and monica,"Ah, yeah!",7,2
chandler,"Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kind of had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.",7,2
phoebe,"Wow!  Hello, Mr. Chandler.",7,2
monica,This is the most special day of our lives.,7,2
chandler,"No, I realize that honey, but I'm not going to spend all of the money on one party.",7,2
monica,"Honey, umm I-I love you,  but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay?  Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only going to get married once.",7,2
chandler,"Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.",7,2
monica,You-you are going to have to put your foot down?,7,2
chandler,"Yes, I am!",7,2
phoebe,"Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.",7,2
joey,Hey Rach.,7,2
rachel,Joey.,7,2
joey,"Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?",7,2
rachel,"Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.",7,2
joey,"No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.",7,2
rachel,"Well no, I don't smell anything.",7,2
joey,"OH, you know what? It's probably just your burning' loins.",7,2
ross,"Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?",7,2
rachel,Nothing!,7,2
ross,"Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?",7,2
rachel,"You know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!",7,2
ross,So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?,7,2
rachel,"Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.",7,2
ross,"Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines!   What is up?",7,2
phoebe,Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!,7,2
ross,Excuse me ladies.  I'm sorry?,7,2
phoebe,"My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.",7,2
ross,I gave him an extremely professional massage!,7,2
phoebe,He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.,7,2
ross,"Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.",7,2
phoebe,"Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!",7,2
ross,"Hey, you know what? This is your fault! you are the one that didn't move his-his appointment.",7,2
phoebe,"Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!",7,2
ross,"He said he liked that!! Oh you are right, you are right. I'm sorry.",7,2
joey,"Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?",7,2
ross,His daughter was hot.,7,2
joey,Gotcha.,7,2
monica,Hey.,7,2
chandler,Hey.,7,2
monica,"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.",7,2
chandler,Ehh.,7,2
monica,"Eh, you work for that.",7,2
chandler,"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.",7,2
monica,You do?!,7,2
chandler,"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that is what we're going to do.",7,2
monica,"Oh, you are so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?",7,2
chandler,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, you know? We'll pick our favourite and that one will get to go to college.",7,2
monica,You thought about that?,7,2
chandler,Yeah.,7,2
monica,How many kids were we going to have?,7,2
chandler,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",7,2
monica,What else did you think about?,7,2
chandler,"Well, stuff like where'd we live, you know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. You know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",7,2
monica,"You know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.",7,2
chandler,Sure you do.,7,2
monica,"No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.",7,2
chandler,You sure?,7,2
monica,Uh-hmm.,7,2
chandler,I love you so much.,7,2
monica,"I love you.  Hey listen umm, when, when you were talking' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.",7,2
chandler,"Oh yeah, totally!",7,2
monica,Oh good.,7,2
joey,"Hello, Zelda.",7,2
rachel,Who are you supposed to be?,7,2
joey,The vicar!,7,2
rachel,Do you even know what a vicar is?,7,2
joey,"Like a goalie, right?",7,2
rachel,"Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!",7,2
joey,"All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.",7,2
rachel,All right! You know what? that is it! You want to do it?! Let's do it!,7,2
joey,Huh?,7,2
rachel,"that is right, I want to do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.",7,2
joey,I-I-I-I did?,7,2
rachel,"Yeah! OH, I've been waiting' so long to get on that body!",7,2
joey,This body?,7,2
rachel,Yeah that is right! Come on Joey; sex me up!,7,2
joey,"Hey-hey, you are starting' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.",7,2
rachel,"Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you are in for a rough ride!",7,2
joey,"I don't want to, I'm scared.",7,2
chandler,"Hey, you guys!",7,3
ross and rachel,Hey!,7,3
chandler,"So, what do you think?",7,3
ross,About what?,7,3
rachel,"Yeah, what?",7,3
joey,What?,7,3
chandler,"Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.",7,3
joey,"Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!",7,3
chandler,I got glasses!,7,3
ross,"Well, you-you've always had glasses.",7,3
chandler,No I didn't!,7,3
ross,Are you sure?,7,3
rachel,"Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...",7,3
joey,Feminine.,7,3
rachel,Yes!,7,3
chandler,No!,7,3
monica,"Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.",7,3
chandler,Really?,7,3
monica,Yeah!,7,3
chandler,"You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?",7,3
monica,Of course!,7,3
phoebe,So what do you guys want for an engagement present?,7,3
chandler,"that is okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...",7,3
monica,"If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.",7,3
rachel,"OH, you know what you should get them? One of those little uh, portable CD players.",7,3
monica,"Oh, I already have one.",7,3
phoebe,Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynaecologist.,7,3
rachel,"Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.",7,3
monica,"Hey, I know I what I want!",7,3
chandler,What we want honey.,7,3
monica,"No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.",7,3
phoebe,You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?,7,3
monica,"Uh-huh, yeah.",7,3
phoebe,You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?,7,3
chandler,Dying people say the craziest things.,7,3
monica,I wanted it for years! I was going to make cookies for my children.,7,3
phoebe,"Break my heart-Oh, all right.",7,3
monica,Okay. I'm going to be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.,7,3
chandler,Our kids are going to be fat aren't they.,7,3
joey,Ahoy!,7,3
chandler,Hey! How's the boat?!,7,3
joey,Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.,7,3
monica,"Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?",7,3
joey,Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!,7,3
phoebe,"If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?",7,3
joey,"Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kind of, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.",7,3
chandler,"Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.",7,3
rachel,"You know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.",7,3
joey,You could?,7,3
rachel,Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.,7,3
phoebe,Your own boat?,7,3
rachel,What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.,7,3
chandler,Do you know what I was thinking'?,7,3
monica,What?,7,3
chandler,"Nothing, I just like to go like this.",7,3
ross,"Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?",7,3
chandler,"Uh why, do you have a lecture?",7,3
ross,"No, why?",7,3
chandler,Then free as a bird. What's up?,7,3
ross,My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.,7,3
monica,"Wow! that is great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.",7,3
ross,"Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.",7,3
chandler,"Well, did-did you correct him?",7,3
ross,"No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.",7,3
monica,"This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.",7,3
ross,Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.,7,3
monica,"Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.",7,3
ross,Yeah.,7,3
monica,He hates to lose.,7,3
chandler,"Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.",7,3
ross,you are not a lefty?,7,3
chandler,Does anybody know me?!,7,3
monica,What's wrong Phoebe?,7,3
phoebe,I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!,7,3
monica,No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!,7,3
phoebe,"Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.",7,3
ross,"Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?",7,3
chandler,Don't worry about it Pheebs.,7,3
ross,No one got me an engagement present.,7,3
phoebe,"Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.",7,3
chandler,An old cookie?,7,3
monica,This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!,7,3
phoebe,"See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.",7,3
chandler,We can't accept this.,7,3
phoebe,Why not?,7,3
chandler,because it's gross.,7,3
monica,No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.,7,3
phoebe,Really?!,7,3
monica,Yeah! I bet I can do it.,7,3
chandler,"Okay, we owe you a present.",7,3
ross,Two! I've been engaged twice!,7,3
joey,Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.  Get out of the way jackass!  Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?,7,3
rachel,That is the Coast Guard.,7,3
joey,What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.,7,3
rachel,"Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.",7,3
joey,All right.,7,3
rachel,"Okay, I'm just going to go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?",7,3
joey,"Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there  where that boatload of girls is!  Yo-ho-ho!",7,3
rachel,"Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You want to go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though,  what's this called?",7,3
joey,"Uh, boat rope.",7,3
rachel,Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?,7,3
joey,"Uhh, rub it?",7,3
rachel,No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?,7,3
joey,"I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...",7,3
rachel,"Time's up, now your dead.",7,3
joey,And deaf!,7,3
rachel,"Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!",7,3
joey,Yes.,7,3
rachel,"Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!",7,3
joey,I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.,7,3
monica,"All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.",7,3
phoebe,You do?,7,3
monica,"You don't?  Well, that is the difference between a professional and a layman.",7,3
phoebe,That and arrogance.,7,3
joey,Hey.,7,3
monica,Hey! How was sailing?,7,3
joey,"I don't want to talk about it. you know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.",7,3
monica and phoebe,No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!,7,3
joey,Women are mean!!!,7,3
phoebe,I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb.  I wish you a long and happy marriage.,7,3
ross,Hey.,7,3
monica,Hey! How was it?,7,3
ross,"Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand...",7,3
chandler,I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.,7,3
ross,And what did he ask you not to call him?,7,3
chandler,"Daddy. All right look, here's the story.  Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were going to take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy.  So I take off my glasses and that is when in happened.",7,3
chandler,Guys?,7,3
ross,Over here.,7,3
mr. geller,Have a seat son.  Hey!!,7,3
monica,Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!,7,3
chandler,I know.,7,3
monica,You gave my father a lap dance!,7,3
chandler,Why do they put so much steam in there?!,7,3
ross,because otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.,7,3
chandler,Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?,7,3
phoebe,"Come on, it's not that big a deal!",7,3
chandler,Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.,7,3
ross,"Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?",7,3
monica,"Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!",7,3
chandler,I don't want him to tell this story for years.,7,3
ross,"Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.",7,3
monica,I wasn't escaping.,7,3
ross,Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?,7,3
monica,I was trying to help out a squirrel.,7,3
ross,You were trying to eat it!,7,3
chandler,If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!,7,3
monica,"Come on.  Hello?  I'm sorry you have the wrong number.   Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.",7,3
chandler,"All right, I'm off to see your dad.",7,3
ross,"Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?",7,3
rachel,"Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.",7,3
chandler,"Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.",7,3
ross,Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?,7,3
rachel,"I don't know. You know, they didn't get us anything.",7,3
ross,Thank you!,7,3
joey,Hey.,7,3
ross,Hey.,7,3
rachel,"Well hello! So, when are we getting' back out on the water matey?",7,3
joey,"Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!",7,3
rachel,Why not?,7,3
joey,Because! you are mean on the boat!,7,3
rachel,What? I was just trying to teach you.,7,3
joey,"Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!",7,3
ross,Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.,7,3
rachel,"Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.",7,3
ross,You have to respect the sea!,7,3
rachel,"Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I got to tell you something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.",7,3
joey,"Does a good teacher say, ""Put down the beer pinhead!?""",7,3
rachel,"Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?",7,3
joey,Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?,7,3
rachel,"Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!",7,3
joey,Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.,7,3
rachel,"All right, you know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.",7,3
joey,You won't boss me around anymore?,7,3
rachel,I won't boss you around.,7,3
joey,And you'll be nice?,7,3
rachel,"And, I'll be nice.",7,3
joey,And you'll be topless?,7,3
rachel,And-Joey!,7,3
joey,Do you want me to learn?!,7,3
monica,"Okay, here's batch 22. OH, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.",7,3
ross,Let's give it a shot.,7,3
monica,"Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.",7,3
phoebe,"Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?",7,3
monica,"No, just a Friday night.",7,3
ross,"OH, these are pretty good.",7,3
phoebe,"Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.",7,3
ross,Which one was that?,7,3
monica,The ones we had right after you almost threw up.,7,3
ross,Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16.  I'm okay.,7,3
phoebe,Are there anymore from the good batch? Because we could just work off of those.,7,3
ross,"Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh...  It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!",7,3
rachel,"Okay Joey honey, you are doing really good! All right, now I'm just going to need you to step to the port side.  Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?",7,3
joey,OH yeah.,7,3
rachel,Right?,7,3
joey,Nope.,7,3
rachel,"It's left sweetie, but that is okay sweetie, that is a tough one.",7,3
joey,I don't know why you just don't say left.,7,3
rachel,"Okay, go to the left.  The left!",7,3
joey,Huh?,7,3
rachel,Just sit over there!!,7,3
joey,"Okay! Okay, you are yelling again! See that?",7,3
rachel,"No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.",7,3
joey,"OH, you know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm going to have me a little beer on the port side.",7,3
rachel,"Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?",7,3
joey,"Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.",7,3
rachel,"Joey, come on! We just went over this!",7,3
joey,"OH, you know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!",7,3
rachel,"No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!",7,3
joey,All right that is it! you are yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!,7,3
rachel,What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!,7,3
joey,Why not?!,7,3
rachel,Because you are not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!,7,3
joey,Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!,7,3
rachel,"Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I?   Did I just say Greens don't quit?!",7,3
joey,Yes! Yes! You did and you are still yelling at me!,7,3
rachel,"No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, oh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this coming'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.",7,3
joey,"Well, hey I did learn.",7,3
rachel,Really?,7,3
joey,Yeah! Come on.,7,3
rachel,Aww...,7,3
joey,"Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is.  I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.",7,3
rachel,Left.,7,3
joey,Damnit!,7,3
phoebe,"You know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-looking' up at us and smiling right now.",7,3
ross,Looking up?,7,3
phoebe,"Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.",7,3
monica,"Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not going to be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.",7,3
ross,"Aww, Pheebs, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?",7,3
phoebe,"Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that is not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.",7,3
ross,"that is the day you are going to die? See-darn it, I've got shuffleboard that day.",7,3
phoebe,that is what you think.,7,3
monica,"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?",7,3
phoebe,"Well, you know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Toulouse.",7,3
monica,What was her name?,7,3
phoebe,Nesele Toulouse.,7,3
monica,Nestle Tollhouse?!,7,3
phoebe,"Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.",7,3
monica,"Phoebe, is this the recipe?",7,3
phoebe,Yes!!  OH.,7,3
monica,I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!,7,3
phoebe,I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  you are burning in hell!!,7,3
chandler,"So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. You know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.",7,3
mr. geller,"I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.",7,3
chandler,What did you do when they found out?,7,3
mr. geller,"They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?",7,3
chandler,So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!,7,3
rachel,"Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.",7,3
joey,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?",7,3
rachel,OH we're not sailing.,7,3
joey,Just pull on it.,7,3
rachel,All right.  Hey-hey-hey!!  Sandwiches!,7,3
joey,What else?,7,3
rachel,Here you go.,7,3
joey,Thank you.,7,3
rachel,Oh wow!,7,3
joey,What are you doing?,7,3
rachel,"OH, sorry.",7,3
joey,What you-don't hold it like that! you are letting' all the good stuff fall out.,7,3
rachel,OH whoops.,7,3
joey,Careful! you are wasting good pastrami!  Oh my God! I'm my dad!,7,3
mac,"Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.",7,4
c.h.e.e.s.e,You can say that again Mac.,7,4
mac,"Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. you are a genius.",7,4
c.h.e.e.s.e,Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12,7,4
joey,"So, what did you guys think?",7,4
monica,"Hello?  Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.",7,4
chandler,It's your mommy. It's your mommy.,7,4
ross,oh...,7,4
rachel,that is nice.,7,4
joey,"Mom, so what did you think?",7,4
rachel,Well that was umm...Okay.,7,4
ross,It wasn't the best.,7,4
chandler,That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.,7,4
monica,Wh-what are we going to tell him?,7,4
ross,"Well, the lighting was okay.",7,4
rachel,"OH no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!",7,4
monica,And I have costumes.,7,4
ross,"Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, ""So, we were watching you in there  and you were sitting' right here! Whoa!""",7,4
rachel,What are you going to do Pheebs?,7,4
phoebe,I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just going to press my breasts up against him.,7,4
chandler,And say nothing?,7,4
phoebe,"Uh-huh, yeah that is right.",7,4
joey,"Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think?  It wasn't that good.",7,4
monica,"Phoebe, do you think that your favourite animal says much about you?",7,4
phoebe,What? You mean behind my back?,7,4
rachel,"Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never going to believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...",7,4
joey,You guys! You guys! you are not going to believe what my agent just told me!,7,4
rachel,Joey! kind of in the middle of a story here!,7,4
joey,"Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.",7,4
rachel,"Okay, so anyway I'm sitting' in my office and guess who walks in.",7,4
joey,I'm going to be on two TV shows!,7,4
monica and phoebe,"Oh, that is great!!",7,4
rachel,Joey!,7,4
joey,"Oh, you weren't finished?",7,4
rachel,Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story.  It was Ralph Lauren!  Ralph Lauren walked into my office!,7,4
joey,"Uh Rach, if you are going to start another story, at least let me finish mine.",7,4
rachel,It's the same story.,7,4
joey,"Wow, it's really long.",7,4
rachel,"Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.",7,4
monica,Still get a discount on wedding dresses?,7,4
rachel,Yeah!,7,4
monica,I'm so happy for you!,7,4
joey,"Well, these really are the days of our lives.",7,4
monica,What?!,7,4
joey,"Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!",7,4
phoebe,Oh God!,7,4
rachel,I got-I get a big pay raise!,7,4
phoebe,Oh hey!,7,4
joey,"I'll be playing Drake Ramoray's twin brother, Stryker!",7,4
monica,Ooh!,7,4

rachel,"Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?",7,4
hilda,What?,7,4
rachel,"I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.",7,4
hilda,No dear. It's not.,7,4
rachel,"No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.",7,4
hilda,Thank you! Good meeting you.,7,4

rachel,"Really?!  Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?",7,4
man,Tag Jones.,7,4
rachel,"Uh-huh, go on.",7,4
tag,that is it. that is my whole name.,7,4
rachel,"that is your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.",7,4
tag,"I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...",7,4
rachel,"Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!",7,4
tag,"It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...",7,4
rachel,"Okay, hold on just a second.  I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?",7,4
chandler,No-no-no-no.  Hey!,7,4
phoebe,"Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.",7,4
monica,Hey sweetie.,7,4
chandler,"Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?",7,4
monica,I can't tell you. It's a secret.,7,4
chandler,Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.,7,4
monica,Aww.  But still no.,7,4
chandler,"No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.",7,4
monica,"Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?",7,4
chandler,"Oh no-no, I can't do that.",7,4
monica,"If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.",7,4
chandler,Okay.,7,4
monica,Okay.,7,4
chandler,"So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.",7,4
monica,Oh my God. He threw up?,7,4
chandler,"No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was Phoebe's secret?",7,4
monica,"Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.",7,4
chandler,that is it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?,7,4
monica,that is right! You lose sucker!!  Please still marry me.,7,4
rachel,"Chandler, you have an assistant right?",7,4
chandler,Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!,7,4
rachel,"No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...",7,4
chandler,What about him?,7,4
rachel,I love him. He's so pretty I want to cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.,7,4
phoebe,"Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.",7,4
rachel,"Uh-huh. No, I hear what you are saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing?  Look how pretty!",7,4
phoebe,"Let's see.  Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me  yes? Thanks.",7,4
rachel,Okay you are right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!,7,4
chandler,Let me see this guy.  W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!,7,4

joey,Okay.,7,4
terry,Here are the audition scenes.,7,4
joey,Audition? I thought you were going to offer me the part.,7,4
terry,Why would you think that?,7,4
joey,"Well, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?",7,4
terry,Everybody has to audition.,7,4
joey,"You know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series,  with a robot.",7,4
terry,I'm sorry Joey that is...that is the way it is.,7,4
joey,"Well. I guess you think you are pretty special huh? Sitting' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for you, huh? Well you know what?  This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!",7,4
rachel,Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?,7,4
tag,I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first...  There is a plant in your office.,7,4
rachel,kind of.,7,4
tag,Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume.,7,4
rachel,"Oh-oh, thank you.",7,4
tag,"Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.",7,4
rachel,Well...,7,4
tag,Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.,7,4

chandler,Hey.,7,4
monica,"Hey! Good, you are home!",7,4
chandler,"Oh it's always nicer to here than, ""Aw crap! You again!""",7,4
monica,Hey baby.,7,4
chandler,Hey.,7,4
monica,I made you a surprise.,7,4
chandler,Oh yeah?,7,4
monica,"Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.",7,4
chandler,Did you not understand the story?,7,4
ross,Hey!,7,4
chandler,Hey! What's up?,7,4
monica,Ross!,7,4
ross,"Oh, nothing' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm going to do for dinner.",7,4
chandler,Huh.,7,4
ross,"Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?",7,4
chandler,No!  Shh!,7,4
ross,What you got over there? Tacos?,7,4
monica,No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.,7,4
ross,"Uhh, those are tacos.",7,4
monica,Excuse me Mr. Mexico.,7,4
ross,"Eh, either way I'll pass.  I still can't eat those.  What's so funny?!",7,4
monica,I'm not laughing.,7,4
ross,You told her!,7,4
chandler,Nancy Thompson's getting fired!,7,4
ross,"Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, ""Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!""",7,4
monica,"you are right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!",7,4
ross,How could you tell her?!,7,4
chandler,I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!,7,4
ross,Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.,7,4
chandler,Du-ude!,7,4
monica,What happened in Atlantic City?!,7,4
ross,"Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...",7,4
chandler,"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!""",7,4
ross,"And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you are thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you are right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.",7,4
monica,You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.,7,4
chandler,"In my defence, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",7,4
ross,"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...",7,4
chandler,"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?",7,4
ross,"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.",7,4
rachel,Hi!,7,4
joey,Hey.,7,4
phoebe,"Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?",7,4

phoebe,"Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.",7,5
ross,"Well, I don't think we are going to have that problem, but maybe that is just because I am not emotionally unavailable!",7,5
phoebe,You think he's emotionally unavailable?,7,5
ross,I think he can be.,7,5
phoebe,"Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!",7,5

kyle,"Oh hey! Good, you are both here.",7,5
whitney,We kind of need to talk.,7,5
phoebe,Both of you together?,7,5
ross,Wh-what's up?,7,5
whitney,"Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing...",7,5
kyle,...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...,7,5
ross,Oh just say it Kyle!,7,5
kyle,We're going to give it another try.,7,5
phoebe,What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!,7,5

phoebe,"And you know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!",7,5
ross,Divorced men's club.,7,5
phoebe,"Potato, Potaato.",7,5
monica,Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!,7,5

monica,"Yeah, we really do!",7,5

monica,Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!,7,5
joey,"You know, we don't have to imagine.",7,5
chandler,I'm marrying her.,7,5
joey,We'll just see.,7,5
monica,"Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honour.",7,6
rachel,Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope it's you!,7,6
phoebe,I hope it's you.,7,6
rachel,Me too!,7,6
monica,"First of all um, I love you both so much and you are both so important to me...",7,6
rachel,"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!",7,6
monica,"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honour for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...",7,6
phoebe,Yes!!! Oh!!,7,6
rachel,Hypothetically!,7,6
phoebe,Still.,7,6
monica,If Phoebe were my maid of honour...,7,6
rachel,Uh-hmm.,7,6
monica,"Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.",7,6
rachel,Yeah that is actually a pretty good idea.,7,6
phoebe,"Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?",7,6
monica,"Well that is the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!",7,6
phoebe,Wh-why is that the best part?,7,6
monica,Because then I don't have to!,7,6
rachel,"Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...",7,6
monica,I'm really not deciding!,7,6
rachel,Fine!,7,6
woman,"Excuse me, I-I couldn't help overhearing, you are marrying Chandler Bing?",7,6
monica,Yeah that is right.,7,6
woman,"Huh, good luck!",7,6
phoebe,"Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!",7,6
chandler,Die Hard still great!,7,6
joey,"Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?",7,6
chandler,What'd you rent?,7,6
joey,Die Hard 2.,7,6
chandler,"Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.",7,6
joey,"Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!",7,6
ross,"Joey, we just saw it!",7,6
joey,And?,7,6
ross,And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!,7,6
joey and ross,Die Hard!!!!!!,7,6
ross,"Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?",7,6
chandler,"Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.",7,6
ross,"Well, John McLane had plans!",7,6
chandler,"No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.",7,6
joey,What are you talking about? Bitch.,7,6
phoebe,Hey Rachel?,7,6
rachel,Yeah?,7,6
phoebe,"Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honour?",7,6
rachel,Really?!,7,6
phoebe,Uh-hmm.,7,6
rachel,Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honour that means you are Monica's.,7,6
phoebe,"Oh! Well, if that is what you want...",7,6
rachel,OH! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!,7,6
phoebe,But why does it even matter?!,7,6
rachel,Why does it matter so much to you?!,7,6
phoebe,Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you are going to marry!,7,6
rachel,What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?,7,6
phoebe,"You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honour to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!",7,6
rachel,Yeah but Phoebe...,7,6
phoebe,"And no, oh please, oh please let me finish.  Oh I guess that was it.",7,6
rachel,Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honour.,7,6
phoebe,"Oh, thank you so much!  Okay.",7,6
rachel,I'm going to marry someone good you know.,7,6
phoebe,Oh I know.,7,6
rachel,Better than Chandler.,7,6
ross,What happened?!!,7,6
joey,"Well, I don't know!!",7,6
ross,We fell asleep! That is all.,7,6
joey,"Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.",7,6
ross,I think that would be best.,7,6
joey,"Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.",7,6
ross,Okay. But not about this!,7,6
joey,No! Never! Never!  Bye.,7,6
ross,No touch! No touch!,7,6
monica,"Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.",7,6
chandler,that is sweet.,7,6
monica,"No, it's more like a  good luck.",7,6
chandler,"So uh, what did this woman look like?",7,6
monica,"She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.",7,6
chandler,"Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?",7,6
monica,"Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?",7,6
chandler,"No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive...  Hold on one second; let me check this out.",7,6
monica,What are you doing?,7,6
chandler,"Well, let's see...  Okay uh, is that her?",7,6
monica,Oh my God yes! Who is she?,7,6
chandler,"Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.",7,6
monica,Did you break up with her?,7,6
chandler,"No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.",7,6
monica,Why?,7,6
chandler,"Well, Because she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...",7,6
monica,Fat?!,7,6
chandler,"I did not say fat! I said, ""Fa-aa-aw-ow...""",7,6
monica,You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!,7,6
chandler,"Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?",7,6
monica,"Well, apparently she does.",7,6
chandler,"Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget.  Seriously, good luck marrying me.",7,6
joey,Hey! What's going on?,7,6
rachel,Phoebe is going to be Monica's maid of honour!,7,6
joey,"Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?",7,6
rachel,You have been maid of honour before?!!,7,6
phoebe,See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!,7,6
rachel,All right that is it! I am maid of honour!,7,6
phoebe,"Na-uh, I am!",7,6
rachel,How come you are?!,7,6
phoebe,Because I cared enough to lie!,7,6
joey,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honour type situations.",7,6
phoebe,What are you talking about?,7,6
joey,"Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.",7,6
phoebe,"Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?",7,6
joey,"Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.",7,6
phoebe,"Well, it's better than us deciding.",7,6
rachel,"Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!",7,6
phoebe,No! Coins hate me!,7,6
rachel,"Okay. Okay fine, you know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.   Hi, Ross! Sweetie.",7,6
phoebe,"Hey there, you handsome thing.",7,6
ross,"Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.",7,6
joey,Hi.,7,6
ross,"Just uh, brought back your videos.",7,6
joey,"Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.",7,6
ross,No! No we don't!,7,6
joey,"Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!",7,6
ross,I... I don't know what you are talking about.,7,6
joey,Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!,7,6
ross,I've had better.,7,6
joey,Okay! When?!,7,6
ross,All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!,7,6
joey,Uh-huh!,7,6
ross,I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!,7,6
joey,I want to do it again.,7,6
ross,We can't do it again.,7,6
joey,Why not?,7,6
ross,Because it's weird!,7,6
joey,Fine! Do you want something to drink?,7,6
ross,"Sure, what do you got?",7,6
joey,Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.,7,6
monica,Chandler!  Chandler! I just figured out who you are!,7,6
chandler,Can you figure out what I'm doing?,7,6
monica,you are Lewis Posin.,7,6
chandler,Who?,7,6
monica,"Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?",7,6
chandler,Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!,7,6
monica,"No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa....  And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! You know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.",7,6
chandler,What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.,7,6
monica,"No, I know. But you know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.",7,6
chandler,"Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!",7,6
joey,"Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're going to give you hypothetical maid of honour situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.",7,6
ross,"No, 10 is the highest.",7,6
joey,Why is 10 the highest?,7,6
ross,"Because it's the highest.  Okay, Rachel you are up first.  Situation No. 1",7,6
joey,I don't want to marry Chandler!,7,6
rachel,"Okay, uh...",7,6
joey,I've got cold feet.,7,6
rachel,...it's going to be okay!,7,6
joey,"No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!",7,6
rachel,"Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. You know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.",7,6
joey,"Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!",7,6
rachel,Thanks!,7,6
ross,"Yes, very nice Rachel.",7,6
rachel,Thank you judges.,7,6
phoebe,"Ugh, what a kiss ass.",7,6
rachel,Oh!,7,6
joey,"Okay, Phoebe...",7,6
phoebe,Yes! Your honour?,7,6
joey,"We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, ""I do"" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!",7,6
ross,"When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!",7,6
phoebe,Oh!,7,6
joey,Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!,7,6
rachel,Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!,7,6
phoebe,Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!,7,6
ross,It is time for you to give your maid of honour speech.,7,6
rachel,"OH, wait a minute, we haven't pre...",7,6
ross,Go!,7,6
rachel,"Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as...  Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.",7,6
ross and joey,Oh! that is nice.,7,6
rachel,"Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass  to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.",7,6
joey,Wow.  Good speech.,7,6
ross,"Yeah, it really was!",7,6
rachel,"Aw, thanks!",7,6
ross,"Okay Phoebe, I guess you are next  although I really don't see the point.",7,6
joey,Yeah.,7,6
phoebe,"Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.",7,6
joey,And she's back in the game.,7,6
chandler,"Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.",7,6
julie,Hello Skidmark.,7,6
chandler,"It's a nickname, I'll explain later.",7,6
monica,It's pretty clear.,7,6
chandler,"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.",7,6
julie,that is why you broke up with me?,7,6
chandler,"You-you-you didn't know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!",7,6
joey,"All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!",7,6
phoebe,Really?! I won!,7,6
rachel,What?!,7,6
ross,"I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.",7,6
rachel,Well then I demand a recount!,7,6
ross,"Actually, it wasn't that close.",7,6
rachel,"No! You know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're going to flip a coin!  All right?!  Heads!",7,6
phoebe,The coins have finally forgiven me!,7,6
rachel,"Well you know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!",7,6
phoebe,"Rach, it's going to be okay!  You guys are the best!",7,6
joey,"Boy I tell you, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.",7,6
ross,Yeah?,7,6
joey,Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.,7,6
ross,Why-why would I care about that?,7,6
joey,"No reason, I'm just saying that uh... that is where I'll be.",7,6
chandler,As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.,7,6
monica,Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.,7,6
chandler,I would really love it if could do both.,7,6
monica,"All right, I...I have to ask.",7,6
chandler,What?,7,6
monica,Are you going to break up with me if I get fat again?,7,6
chandler,What?!,7,6
monica,"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?",7,6
chandler,A hundred and forty-five pounds.,7,6
monica,In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! that is not the point.,7,6
chandler,"Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!",7,6
monica,"Well... that is not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.",7,6
chandler,"Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.",7,6
monica,How?,7,6
chandler,You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!,7,6
monica,"What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm going to look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!",7,6
chandler,"Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you are Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.",7,6
monica,Keep going.,7,6
chandler,So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.,7,6
monica,Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?,7,6
chandler,I'd carry you around in my pocket.,7,6
monica,I love you.,7,6
chandler,Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.,7,6
rachel,Hi Pheebs.,7,6
phoebe,Hi!,7,6
rachel,Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.,7,6
phoebe,"that is ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once.  Oh, you mean today.",7,6
rachel,"Yeah. Yeah, and you know you-you deserve to win. And-and you know I was thinking about it, if-if you are Monica's maid of honour that means I get to be yours.",7,6
phoebe,Oh yeah!,7,6
rachel,"Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, you know just in case...",7,6
phoebe,Oh that is so sweet thanks.,7,6
rachel,"Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and oh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride.  And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. you know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.",7,6
phoebe,OH.,7,6
rachel,"And umm, vintage handkerchiefs you know Because, people cry at weddings.  I'm just going to grab a couple of these.",7,6
phoebe,This stuff is great!,7,6
rachel,"Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue.  Yeah...",7,6
phoebe,"You know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honour.",7,6
rachel,You do? Why?,7,6
phoebe,Because I think it means more to you.,7,6
rachel,"But Pheebs, you know you earned it.",7,6
phoebe,"Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?",7,6
rachel,"No, I was ten. I just developed early.",7,6
phoebe,Man alive!,7,6
monica,"Hey, what's going on?",7,6
rachel,Hey!,7,6
phoebe,"Well, we just decided that Rachel is going to be your maid of honour.",7,6
monica,"OH, wow! that is great!  Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6",7,6
rachel,"Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's going to be yours.",7,6
joey,Great nap.,7,6
ross,It really was.,7,6
joey,Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!,7,6
ross,Excuse me.,7,6
joey,Morning!,7,7
rachel,"Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?",7,7
joey,Pretty good.,7,7
rachel,"Oh good.  Ah! My God, sorry!",7,7
joey,"Okay, really good. Anyway I got to go; I'm late for work.",7,7
rachel,What-what?! you are going to leave this person with me?!,7,7
joey,"Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favour? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.",7,7
rachel,Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!,7,7
joey,"Just casually slip it in, you know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.",7,7
rachel,"You know what? that is a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you are a pig?",7,7
joey,"Hey, I'm going to call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave them for me.",7,7
rachel,"Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.",7,7
joey,"Fine!  Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?",7,7
erin,Hi!,7,7
rachel,Hi.,7,7
erin,"Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.",7,7
rachel,"Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it when I moved in.",7,7
erin,"You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.",7,7
rachel,Hi.,7,7
erin,"Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?",7,7
rachel,Would you like some pancakes?,7,7
chandler,...Come on! Why are we here?!,7,7
ross,"Okay, okay take a guess.",7,7
chandler,The hot chicks?,7,7
ross,"Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, you know-You know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!",7,7
chandler,Wow that is actually pretty cool.,7,7
ross,"Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?",7,7
chandler,Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.,7,7
female student,I'm so sorry!,7,7
male student,Sorry!,7,7
chandler,"You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?",7,7
monica,She sent the chicken back again?!,7,7

monica,"Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.",7,7
chandler,Right.,7,7
monica,"Well, she actually has a boyfriend you know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kind of invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.",7,7
chandler,You said no right?,7,7
monica,Huh?,7,7

monica,Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.,7,7
chandler,What do you think she's just going to sit there quietly? You don't think she's going to want to make a toast? You don't think she's going to want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!,7,7
monica,"Oh my God, she's not going to like the chicken that night either is she?!",7,7
chandler,You know what? It's going to be okay. You know what? She's probably not going to even want to come.,7,7
monica,Really?,7,7
chandler,No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?,7,7
monica,So-so you would've just lied?,7,7
chandler,Yes!!,7,7

phoebe,"Yeah, but you always say that.",7,7
rachel,"Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.",7,7
joey,"Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.",7,7
phoebe,Whatever.,7,7
rachel,Fine.,7,7
joey,"Hey, don't start judging me!  Huh? you are the one who's in love with her assistant!  Huh? And you, you are the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!",7,7
rachel,Phoebe!,7,7
phoebe,Secret affair!,7,7
ross,People are doing it in front of my book!,7,7
rachel,I'm sorry?,7,7
ross,"My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students making' babies right in the middle of the Palaeontology section!",7,7
rachel,Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?,7,7
ross,"Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.",7,7
rachel,"Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.",7,7
ross,"Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!",7,7
joey,"Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?",7,7
ross,Oh for crying' out loud!,7,7
joey,"All right, so we should go catch our movie.",7,7
rachel,Well now what's the rush?,7,7
joey,I like to see the previews.  The candy.,7,7
phoebe,Oh. Hey!,7,7

erin,Hey!,7,7
joey,Hey!,7,7
erin,Joey.,7,7
joey,Erin.,7,7
erin,Hey Rachel.,7,7
rachel,"Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!",7,7
erin,What's wrong?,7,7
rachel,"Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.",7,7
phoebe,Oh no.,7,7
joey,What party?,7,7
phoebe and rachel,A birthday party.,7,7

joey,"Oh, and how is Allison?",7,7
phoebe and rachel,32,7,7
rachel,Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!,7,7
joey,"Yeah, look how that worked out.",7,7
ross,"Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Palaeontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?",7,7
the librarian,"Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.",7,7
ross,No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!,7,7
the head librarian,How can I help you?,7,7
ross,"Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Palaeontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.",7,7
the head librarian,"We are aware of the problem you are referring too.  But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.",7,7
ross,"Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself!  And don't you follow me!",7,7
joey,Hey.,7,7
phoebe,Hey!,7,7
rachel,How did it go with Erin?,7,7
joey,"Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!",7,7
phoebe,"Yay!! Oh so, you are not, you are not mad at us anymore?",7,7
joey,"No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. You know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.",7,7
phoebe,Didn't you sleep together?,7,7
joey,"Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that is a...",7,7
rachel,"Oh my God! Listen to you talking' about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please don't get married before I do.",7,7
joey,Okay.,7,7
janice,Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!,7,7
monica,He might still show up.,7,7
janice,"Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.",7,7
monica,Is that all?,7,7
janice,"I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?",7,7
chandler,"Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.",7,7
monica,It's actually going to be just family.,7,7
janice,"Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?",7,7
joey,How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!,7,7
erin,What about Benitez?,7,7
joey,What about Game 1 of the Series?,7,7
erin,What about shut up?,7,7
joey,You shut up!  I love arguing with her.  I'll be right back.,7,7
erin,Okay.,7,7
rachel,So how's it going' with Joey?,7,7
erin,"Uh, okay.",7,7
rachel,"Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.",7,7
erin,"Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.",7,7
rachel,But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did you just change your mind?!,7,7
erin,kind of.,7,7
phoebe,Then change it back!,7,7
erin,I'm sorry I... It's just there's no real spark.,7,7
phoebe,No spark? Didn't you sleep together?,7,7
erin,Yeah.,7,7
rachel,"Ugh, tramp!",7,7
phoebe,Does Joey have any idea?,7,7
erin,"I really don't think he does. And you know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. you know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.",7,7
phoebe,"Yeah, you mean like that you are kind of a loner.",7,7
erin,Yeah! That would be great!,7,7
phoebe,"Yeah, and maybe that you are a real",7,7
erin,I'm sorry?,7,7
phoebe,"Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.",7,7
joey,Hey! You want to go?,7,7
erin,"Yeah, let's go.",7,7
joey,Okay. See you guys later.,7,7
erin,Bye guys.,7,7
rachel,"Yeah, see you.",7,7
joey,"Hey, thank you so much.",7,7
rachel,"Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.",7,7
phoebe,"No, just a regular old flying dwarf.",7,7
ross,Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?,7,7
guy,"Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.",7,7
ross,"Oh-oh, you are-you are fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?",7,7
guy,Uhh....,7,7
ross,"Ah... Ah...Get out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?",7,7
woman,"Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.",7,7
ross,I find Marion's views far to progressionist.,7,7
woman,"I'm sorry, who are you?",7,7
ross,"I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.",7,7
woman,"Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh-Wait!  Did you write this?",7,7
ross,Yes! you are the person who checked out my book?!,7,7
woman,"You know, you look nothing like I would've thought. you are...you are so young.",7,7
ross,"Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.",7,7
ross,I am very...very sorry.,7,7
joey,Hey!,7,7
phoebe,Hey!,7,7
rachel,Hi!,7,7
phoebe,"So how was, how was your date?",7,7
joey,"Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.",7,7
phoebe,Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?,7,7
joey,"No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's going to be tricky thought because she said she was going to be pretty busy at work for a while.",7,7
phoebe and rachel,"Oh no, yeah.",7,7
rachel,"Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kind of got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not looking' for a serious relationship.",7,7
joey,Where are you getting' this?,7,7
rachel,"Well, she told me. She said she's kind of a loner.",7,7
joey,Oh. Oh.,7,7
rachel,Joey...,7,7
joey,"No hey Rach, it's cool okay? You know I'm a loner too!  Right?",7,7
phoebe,"Hey Joey, you know what? You are way to good for her.",7,7
rachel,Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell them you are not looking for a relationship.,7,7
joey,"No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.",7,7
rachel,Well that too.  Joey?,7,7
joey,Yeah?,7,7
rachel,Do you want some pancakes?,7,7
joey,Finally!,7,7
monica,What are we going to do?,7,7
chandler,I say we go with Careless Whisper.,7,7
janice,Chandler?,7,7
chandler,Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,7,7
monica,"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?",7,7
janice,"Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight.  I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.",7,7
monica,Our kids are going to call her Aunt Janice aren't they?,7,7
janice,"Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.",7,7
chandler,Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?,7,7
janice,Do you have any tissues?,7,7
monica,"Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.",7,7
janice,Okay!,7,7
monica,We'll just...we'll just let her stay.,7,7
chandler,"No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!",7,7
monica,kind of like your Barca lounger.,7,7
chandler,Is that what you are thinking about right now?,7,7
monica,I never stop thinking about it.,7,7
janice,"Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.",7,7
chandler,"Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.",7,7
janice,Why not?,7,7
chandler,"Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.",7,7
janice,"Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal.  Do you have a cat? Because it's already happening.  Do you hear that?",7,7
monica,Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!,7,7
janice,Why?,7,7
monica,Because Chandler still has feelings for you!,7,7
janice,He does?,7,7
chandler,Say again?,7,7
monica,that is right. that is right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.,7,7
chandler,"Feelings, such strong feelings.",7,7
monica,"I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.",7,7
janice,"Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go.  Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler,  you call me when this goes in the pooper.",7,7
ross,"Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby  to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.",7,7
chandler,I just wanted to show Monica your book.,7,7
ross,Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!,7,8
chandler,"No, no, no. No-no-no.",7,8
"joey, rachel, and phoebe",Shh!,7,8
ross,"What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?",7,8
chandler,"No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.",7,8
ross,What? that is like insanely easy!,7,8
chandler,"Now, that is a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .",7,8
monica,"It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.",7,8
ross,What? You forgot fourteen states?,7,8
monica,Nobody cares about the Dakotas.,7,8
chandler,"Oh, okay, time's up!",7,8
rachel,"All right, I got 48.",7,8
chandler,"Oh that is not bad, Pheebs?",7,8
phoebe,"Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one",7,8
chandler,"Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?",7,8
joey,Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.,7,8
ross,"Wow, how many have you got?",7,8
joey,Fifty-six!,7,8
joey,Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!,7,8
chandler,Does South Oregon have a sports-team?  There you go.,7,8
rachel,How come we have one extra place setting?,7,8
monica,because you invited your assistant.,7,8
rachel,"Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.",7,8
monica,Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.,7,8
rachel,"Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you are food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.",7,8
monica,"Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake,  but I still do.",7,8
phoebe,"Regular Celery!  Oh, I already have that.",7,8
ross,Done! With time a-to-spare.,7,8
chandler,Ooh that may be a New World's record,7,8
ross,"You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kind of disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colourful things called ""a globe?"" Hmm?",7,8
chandler,"Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.",7,8
ross,What? that is impossible.,7,8
joey,"46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?",7,8
monica,"All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm going to turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!",7,8
chandler,"I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up!",7,8
ross,"No, just give me another minute.",7,8
chandler,"Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.",7,8
ross,"This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.",7,8
chandler,"Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!",7,8
ross,you are on!,7,8
joey,"All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, Because there's a lot on there that you don't have.",7,8
monica,"Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?",7,8
joey,"But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?",7,8
monica,"Ross, I'm going to use yours, okay?",7,8
ross,Pshhshhh!,7,8
monica,Chandler? Can you give me a hand?,7,8
chandler,"Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.",7,8
joey,"Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.",7,8
phoebe,Hey you guys I'm going to go out and take a walk.,7,8
ross,"Phoebe, why is your bag moving?",7,8
phoebe,"Oh, it's not!",7,8
rachel,"Seriously, it's moving!",7,8
joey,What the hell is in there?,7,8
phoebe,It's just my knitting that is all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.,7,8
monica,Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?,7,8
chandler,I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.,7,8
monica,that is my pie!,7,8
chandler,Which smells delicious!,7,8
monica,Uh-oh! Uh-oh!,7,8
chandler,What?,7,8
monica,"We left Joey alone with the food!  Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!",7,8
phoebe,Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?,7,8
monica,"Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?",7,8
phoebe,"I'm sorry, who's this?",7,8
monica,"Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!",7,8
chandler,"Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!",7,8
phoebe,"No, there's no dog here?",7,8
monica,Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.,7,8
phoebe,Oh my god! Where are you?,7,8
monica,I'll be right there!,7,8
phoebe,They're here already? How are they doing this?,7,8
rachel,Hi Tag! What are you doing here?,7,8
tag,"I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.",7,8
rachel,"Well, sure! Come in!  Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?",7,8
tag,We kind of broke up this morning.,7,8
rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry.",7,8
tag,"Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.",7,8
ross,Ohio!! Thank you!,7,8
chandler,Huh! Where is the dog?!,7,8
ross,What dog? There-there's no dog here.,7,8
joey,Yeah that dog left!,7,8
monica,"Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!",7,8
phoebe,There's no dog in here.,7,8
chandler,"Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!",7,8
phoebe,"No that is just me coughing!  Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.",7,8
chandler,What is it doing here?,7,8
phoebe,"Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait.  Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?",7,8
monica,"Ooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!",7,8
chandler,"Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!",7,8
phoebe,"that is odd, Because this dog's been living here for the past 3 days",7,8
chandler,Really?,7,8
monica,"Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you are not allergic to this dog?",7,8
chandler,"Well, it still has to go, right?",7,8
monica and phoebe,Why?,7,8
chandler,"Okay, it's um...",7,8
joey,Don't do it!,7,8
monica,Don't do what?,7,8
chandler,"I have to! Okay? It's time!  Okay, I hate dogs.",7,8
all,What?,7,8
phoebe,Are you crazy?,7,8
ross,Are you out of your mind?,7,8
phoebe,Why?,7,8
joey,Told you.,7,8
chandler,"They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.",7,8
ross,"Right, they are scary.  Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!",7,8
rachel,"Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?",7,8
chandler,Is there a puppy here?,7,8
tag,You don't like puppies?,7,8
chandler,"Okay, you are new!",7,8
joey,"Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.",7,8
phoebe,You don't like ice cream?,7,8
ross,It's too cold.,7,8
chandler,"Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.",7,8
ross,It hurts my teeth.,7,8
chandler,"And I don't want to say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go.  Oh my god!!",7,8
ross,How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.,7,8
monica,1250,7,8
ross,"Damn, I forgot you were here.",7,8
phoebe,All right. We're going to take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.,7,8
rachel,"Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?",7,8
monica,Yeah.,7,8
rachel,"When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?",7,8
phoebe,"Oh, I'd say about a month.",7,8
monica,Really? I'd say 3 to 4.,7,8
joey,Half hour.,7,8
rachel,Interesting.,7,8
monica,"When it's your assistant, I would say never.",7,8
joey,"All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.",7,8
rachel,Huh. A moo-point?,7,8
joey,"Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.",7,8
rachel,"Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?",7,8
monica,"Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.",7,8
rachel,"you are right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that is what I'm going to do.",7,8
joey,"Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.",7,8
rachel,Hey!,7,8
tag,Hey.,7,8
rachel,How are you holding up?,7,8
tag,Not bad.,7,8
rachel,Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.,7,8
tag,Thanks.,7,8
rachel,So were you guys together a long time?,7,8
tag,A year. On and off. I kind of thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.,7,8
rachel,Now that she broke up with you?,7,8
tag,Yeah.,7,8
rachel,Yeah. Hmm.,7,8
tag,"It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?",7,8
rachel,"No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.",7,8
tag,Why?,7,8
rachel,"Because, uh-it has to.",7,8
tag,"You have all the answers, don't you?",7,8
rachel,"Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.",7,8
tag,"Hey, thanks for talking to me.",7,8
rachel,"Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!",7,8
joey,"All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told you, you should go for it!",7,8
tag,What?,7,8
joey,"Street noise drowned any of that out?  No, all right, I see you later, okay...",7,8
tag,What did Joey say? I like you back?,7,8
rachel,"Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you are hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!",7,8
tag,Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.,7,8
rachel,"No?  All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.",7,8
tag,Wow.,7,8
rachel,"Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that is crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.",7,8
tag,Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car!,7,8
rachel,What?,7,8
tag,Right there! that is my car!  Hey!!,7,8
rachel,"Okay, that is going to take them a minute. Do you have anything else you want to get off your chest?",7,8
tag,I can't believe this!,7,8
rachel,"Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet!  Oh look, there they go, okay.",7,8
monica,"Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.",7,8
phoebe,"Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.",7,8
monica,Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.,7,8
phoebe,"Yeah, okay.",7,8
monica,"Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica!  Ooh, I can't leave her!",7,8
phoebe,"You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.",7,8
monica,that is not going to work.,7,8
phoebe,I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.,7,8
monica,Hey! I didn't know either.,7,8
phoebe,"Yeah, but you kind of knew that something was going on, didn't you?",7,8
monica,"Yeah, I knew.",7,8
phoebe,Where's Chandler?,7,8
chandler,Here I am.,7,8
phoebe,Wash your hands!!!,7,8
chandler,How did you...know?,7,8
ross,Hey! What's she doing back here?,7,8
monica,"Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!",7,8
ross,"Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...",7,8
phoebe,"No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.",7,8
ross,"Yeah, but, but look what I'm...",7,8
phoebe,"See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.",7,8
chandler,Where's Monica?,7,8
ross,"Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.",7,8
chandler,Why not?,7,8
ross,Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.,7,8
chandler,"Well, I, I should go in there.",7,8
ross,"No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.",7,8
chandler,Why not?,7,8
ross,Because you sent away the dog!,7,8
chandler,This is ridiculous.,7,8
ross,"Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.",7,8
joey,"Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food!  What's the matter?",7,8
chandler,"Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.",7,8
joey,"So? Bring the dog back, you are a hero.",7,8
chandler,"Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?",7,8
joey,"Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.",7,8
chandler,And that doesn't scare you?,7,8
joey,"Ross, you need some help?",7,8
ross,"From you?  Yes, please!",7,8
joey,"First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!",7,8
ross,"I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.",7,8
joey,Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.,7,8
rachel,"Yeah, oh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth?  I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you.  Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out",7,8
joey,"If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.",7,8
phoebe,"Hey, is Chandler here?",7,8
chandler,"No, no he went for a walk.",7,8
phoebe,"Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!",7,8
rachel,Hi!,7,8
joey,Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!,7,8
phoebe,"Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!",7,8
joey,You think?,7,8
monica,"Hi, honey.",7,8
chandler,"Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.",7,8
monica,"What? Why, why would...",7,8
phoebe,"Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.",7,8
chandler,"Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. You know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbours, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.",7,8
phoebe,"We have good news, look whose back!",7,8
rachel,Hi!,7,8
chandler,Clunkers?! Oh my god!,7,8
monica,"that is right, she came back all by herself.",7,8
phoebe,It's a Thanksgiving miracle!,7,8
chandler,It is so good to see you!,7,8
phoebe,"Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?",7,8
ross,"Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.",7,8
chandler,It's up to you.,7,8
rachel,"Oh, hi! How are you doing?",7,8
tag,I'm okay. I got to go down to the police station and look at mug shots.,7,8
rachel,Oh.,7,8
tag,"Thanks for having me over, you guys.",7,8
ross,"Tag? Y-you are going?  Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you are from again?",7,8
tag,Colorado.,7,8
ross,"Ah, what good are you.",7,8
rachel,"Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.",7,8
tag,Okay.,7,8
rachel,"Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-You know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?",7,8
tag,"Um, I'm not.",7,8
rachel,"Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.",7,8
tag,"No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.",7,8
rachel,Really?,7,8
tag,"Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.",7,8
rachel,"Okay, well, that is one less thing we have to do on Monday.",7,8
ross,Delaware!  Delaware!,7,8
chandler,All right.,7,8
ross,I want my turkey now!,7,8
chandler,You got it.  You got Nevada twice.,7,8
ross,I know.,7,8
chandler,Yeah.,7,8
ben,I'm ready!,7,9
ross,You sure?,7,9
ben,Uh-huh!,7,9
chandler,"Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.",7,9
ben,Thanks daddy.,7,9
ross,"No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.",7,9
chandler,Okay. Okay.,7,9
ross,Yes! Yes! Yes!!,7,9
phoebe,"His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!",7,9
monica,"Oh yeah, I remember mine! OH, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.",7,9
ross,Yeah.,7,9
phoebe,I never had a bike of my own.,7,9
ross,What?!,7,9
phoebe,"Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow coloured tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.",7,9
chandler,That sounds like my first bike.  My dad gave me his old one.,7,9
ross,OH.,7,9
monica,Did the girl ever let you ride it?,7,9
phoebe,No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front.  So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.,7,9
ross,That is so unfair!,7,9
phoebe,"Not really, I got to drag him around too!",7,9
chandler,Hey! What are you guys doing?,7,9
joey,Hey.,7,9
monica,Making holiday candy for the neighbours.,7,9
chandler,"I'm sorry, who?",7,9
monica,I'm going to hang this basket  on the door and when the neighbours walk by they can all take a piece.,7,9
chandler,But we don't know the neighbours.,7,9
joey,"I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Moustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.",7,9
monica,See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbours.,7,9
chandler,Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?,7,9
rachel,Good morning!!,7,9
chandler,"Eh, somebody's in a good mood!",7,9
rachel,"Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!",7,9
monica,Where you can make out with your assistant.,7,9
rachel,"Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.",7,9
monica,"Oh yeah, what's the plan?",7,9
rachel,We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.,7,9
monica,Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!,7,9
rachel,"Well you know, we did other stuff too.",7,9
monica,Did you two...,7,9
rachel,"Oh Monica come on, you know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!",7,9
monica,"Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...",7,9
rachel,Anymore!!,7,9
monica,Okay.,7,9
rachel,"Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?",7,9
tag,"Yes, at 4",7,9
rachel,"Okay, thank you. That'll be all.   Wait! Wait!  Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.",7,9
tag,I'd better get back to my desk.,7,9
rachel,"Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.",7,9
tag,My what?,7,9
rachel,"Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But you know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.",7,9
tag,Are you serious?,7,9
rachel,"No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?",7,9
monica,"The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbours ate all the candy!",7,9
chandler,"Well, either that or uh...",7,9
monica,Joey!!,7,9
joey,Yeah?,7,9
monica,Did you eat all the neighbour candy?!,7,9
joey,"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!",7,9
phoebe,"Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!",7,9
monica,They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've got to go make more!!,7,9
joey,"Hey Mon, you might want to make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.",7,9
monica,Ross! The neighbours ate all my candy!!,7,9
ross,"Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!!  Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.",7,9
phoebe,Sure!,7,9
ross,"Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so...",7,9
phoebe,Oh my God Ross!!,7,9
ross,You like it?,7,9
phoebe,I love it!!,7,9
ross,Yeah?,7,9
phoebe,OH!! OH!! And I love you!,7,9
ross,Ahh.,7,9
phoebe,Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!,7,9
ross,"Ah!  Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, you know give it a test ride.",7,9
phoebe,Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.,7,9
ross,you are welcome.,7,9
phoebe,Oh and Chandler's about to cry.,7,9
chandler,Am not!,7,9
monica,Who is that?!,7,9
chandler,"Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave!  No-no-no-no!!   Can you tell me who is there please?",7,9
the knocker,"My name is Gary, I live upstairs.",7,9
gary,Hi!,7,9
monica,Hi. Do you know what time it is?,7,9
gary,It's candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.,7,9
monica,Oh please!  Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.,7,9
chandler,4,7,9
gary,"So, can I get some candy?",7,9
chandler,"I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!   He does not know that I am not some of us.",7,9
monica,"Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.",7,9
gary,"Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?",7,9
monica,Um-hmm.,7,9
gary,Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!,7,9
chandler,Mm! Night Gar'!,7,9
rachel,So did you read your evaluation yet?,7,9
tag,No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.,7,9
rachel,"Okay please, you are kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!",7,9
tag,A joke they would appreciate?,7,9
rachel,I'm thinking' no.,7,9
tag,What did you say?!,7,9
rachel,"Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.",7,9
tag,"No, not my touchie.",7,9
rachel,"Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, ""Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,"" and under Problems with Performance I wrote, ""Dear God, I hope not,"" and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.",7,9
monica,"Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.",7,9
joey,Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!,7,9
chandler,"Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!",7,9
joey,Those two only had each other!,7,9
ross,Phoebe really likes the bike huh?,7,9
monica,"Oh yeah! I saw her walking' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.",7,9
joey,"Yeah, I saw her this morning walking' it by the park.",7,9
ross,"Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?",7,9
joey,Hey Pheebs?,7,9
phoebe,Oh hi!,7,9
chandler,Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?,7,9
phoebe,"OH, uh-huh so much!",7,9
ross,Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don't you?,7,9
phoebe,Of course!,7,9
monica,"Umm, can we see you ride it?",7,9
phoebe,Okay.  See?,7,9
monica,"See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.  Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!",7,9
chandler,What happened? I'm just eating candy.,7,9
rachel,"Maybe it's not as bad as I think. You know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.",7,9
chandler,"Absolutely! You know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.",7,9
rachel,"Ugh, I just got to get the thing back!",7,9
joey,Hey Rach?,7,9
rachel,Yeah?,7,9
joey,That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?,7,9
rachel,Oh my God! Joey!,7,9
chandler,What is the matter with you?,7,9
rachel,Ugh!,7,9
joey,"Boy I tell you, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.",7,9
the woman,"Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.",7,9
monica,"I'm sorry, I can't help you. See?  Rules are rules.",7,9
the woman,"Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!",7,9
monica,"No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell them?",7,9
the woman,I told them your candy is absolutely indescribable!,7,9
monica,"Some people have been saying its you know little drops of heaven, but whatever.",7,9
the woman,"Please, can't you help me out?",7,9
joey,"Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?",7,9
chandler,"Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?",7,9
monica,"All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!",7,9
the woman,"Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!",7,9
joey and chandler,"Yeah, that is her.",7,9
the woman,Thank you.,7,9
monica,It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!,7,9
chandler,You know what would work?,7,9
monica,Hmm?,7,9
chandler,Stop making candy!,7,9
monica,But they like it!,7,9
chandler,You mean they like you.,7,9
monica,Maybe.,7,9
chandler,Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?,7,9
monica,"Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?",7,9
ross,"Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...",7,9
phoebe,"Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!",7,9
ross,"Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!",7,9
phoebe,Why? Why do I have to learn?,7,9
ross,Well...In-in case of emergency.,7,9
phoebe,What kind of an emergency?,7,9
ross,"Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, ""You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you.""",7,9
phoebe,"Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.",7,9
ross,"Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?",7,9
phoebe,You won't let go?,7,9
ross,No!,7,9
phoebe,Swear?!,7,9
ross,I swear!,7,9
phoebe,Okay.,7,9
ross,"Come on.  All right, here we go. All right?",7,9
phoebe,All right.,7,9
ross,All right. Feel good?,7,9
phoebe,Well...,7,9
ross,"All right, try pedalling.",7,9
phoebe,Okay.,7,9
ross,"that is it, your doing great.",7,9
phoebe,Okay.,7,9
ross,Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!,7,9
phoebe,Weee!!!,7,9
ross,Yes!! Yes!!!,7,9
phoebe,Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!,7,9
ross,I-I just thought you were doing so well. I...,7,9
phoebe,I am shocked! Shocked!!,7,9
ross,It's a legitimate learning technique.  Wow!,7,9
ross,"Hey, there's uh, some people outside, asking' about candy.",7,9
monica,"Well, they're just going to have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!",7,9
ross,Need some help?,7,9
monica,No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!,7,9
ross,"By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.",7,9
phoebe,"Oh, hello liar.",7,9
ross,"Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.",7,9
phoebe,I could've been killed I hope you know!,7,9
ross,"I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!",7,9
phoebe,"Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.",7,9
ross,Phoebe.,7,9
phoebe,What?!  What the hell?!,7,9
ross,"All right, you know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just going to have to take it back.",7,9
phoebe,What?! Why?!,7,9
ross,"Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you are-you are killing its spirit!  The bike is dying.",7,9
phoebe,"All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.",7,9
ross,Great! Great!  you are making the bike very happy.,7,9
phoebe,Okay Ross!  Please don't die!,7,9
rachel,"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're going to have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.",7,9
tag,that is kind of sad.,7,9
rachel,"Yeah, well Betty's kind of sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.",7,9
tag,Got it!,7,9
rachel,Let's roll!,7,9
mr. zelner,"Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?",7,9
rachel,"Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.",7,9
mr. zelner,"Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.",7,9
rachel,"Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?",7,9
mr. zelner,"Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty.  So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?",7,9
rachel,"Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean,  what would happen exactly.",7,9
mr. zelner,"Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.",7,9
rachel,Well...,7,9
tag,"Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.",7,9
rachel,Oh no-no-no...,7,9
tag,"Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.",7,9
mr. zelner,You wrote that you have a cute touchie?,7,9
tag,"Yes. I have a weird sense of humour, and I'm kind of strangely proud of my butt.",7,9
mr. zelner,"It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?",7,9
rachel,you are looking' at it upside down-You know what?  It doesn't matter.,7,9
mr. zelner,"Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humour, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now?  No? Okay, well uh, you've  got my fax number.",7,9
rachel,Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.,7,9
tag,"No, don't worry about it.",7,9
rachel,"No, you could've lost your job.",7,9
tag,"Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.",7,9
rachel,Thank you! you are great!,7,9
tag,You know what?,7,9
rachel,What?,7,9
tag,I feel great.  In fact!  What?,7,9
rachel,I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.,7,9
tag,"Oh, I'm sorry.",7,9
rachel,There it is.,7,9
chandler,What is going on?,7,9
the man,We're waiting for the candy.  Bring out the candy!,7,9
joey,Yeah lady! Give us candy!!,7,9
chandler,Joey!,7,9
joey,What's up buddy?,7,9
chandler,What are you doing?,7,9
joey,Waiting for candy.,7,9
chandler,"Get in here!  Hey, and you can not smoke in here!   Merry Christmas.",7,9
monica,"Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!",7,9
all,We want candy! We want candy now!,7,9
chandler,"All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down!  What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?",7,9
the man,Candy Lady?,7,9
chandler,No not  Candy Lady.,7,9
joey,"Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!",7,9
chandler,"All right, you know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!",7,9
joey,"that is right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!",7,9
monica,Thank you.,7,9
chandler,you are welcome.,7,9
monica,Did you smoke?,7,9
chandler,No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?,7,9
monica,"I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.",7,9
joey,"Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...",7,9
phoebe,I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.,7,9
ross,"Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. you are the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.",7,9
phoebe,"Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.",7,9
chandler,Buh-bye.  I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Music man to celebrate our first holiday season as a betrothed couple.,7,10
monica,Betrothed...,7,10

phoebe,"Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.",7,10
rachel,Oh my god!!,7,10
phoebe,"No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.",7,10
ross,Hey!,7,10
all,Hey!,7,10
monica,Licorice?,7,10
ross,"Sure!  Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.",7,10
all,OH! that is great!,7,10
monica,Are you going to dress up as Santa?,7,10
ross,"Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I want to take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.",7,10
phoebe,And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.,7,10
rachel,You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.,7,10
ross,Hmm.,7,10
joey,Hey.,7,10
rachel,Did you know he was in there?,7,10
monica,No.,7,10
chandler,How long have we been home?,7,10
monica,About a half an hour.,7,10
chandler,Lovely!,7,10
chandler,"Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you going to change your last name to Bing?",7,10
monica,No.,7,10

phoebe,"Oh, hey, you guys!",7,10
chandler,Hey!,7,10
monica,Hey!,7,10
phoebe,"Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is going to get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.",7,10
monica,"Ahh, Phoebe, I'm going to miss you!",7,10
phoebe,"Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I got to go tell Rachel the good news.",7,10
chandler,OH! You guys going to be living together again?,7,10
phoebe,"Yeah, why not?",7,10
chandler,"Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.",7,10
phoebe,"Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?",7,10
chandler,"No reason, except...she...told...me.",7,10
phoebe,"Really? So she said, she didn't want to live with me anymore?",7,10
chandler,"No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.",7,10
monica,"Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.",7,10
phoebe,you are sure? you are absolutely sure?,7,10
monica,"Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.",7,10
phoebe,"Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word.  Kind of what -probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself, ""you know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably! ""you know? You got to take care of yourselves!  In this world history teaches us nothing!",7,10
chandler,"Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?",7,10
rachel,Hey!,7,10
joey,"Hey! Great, you are home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!",7,10
rachel,Drums?,7,10
joey,No! Drums!,7,10
chandler,"Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?",7,10
monica,"I'm sorry. But not that sorry, Because you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.",7,10
maitre d',"Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.",7,10
chandler,Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Music man at 8,7,10
maitre d',"I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.",7,10
chandler,Is this because of the burrito thing?,7,10
monica,You need to give him money.,7,10
chandler,Give him money? It was a joke!,7,10
monica,"No, to get a table! Places like are always shaking' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.",7,10
chandler,"Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.",7,10
monica,You've got to be smooth about it.,7,10
chandler,"Hey, I can be smooth.  Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.",7,10
maitre d',"Of course, sir.",7,10
chandler,Okay.,7,10
monica,How did it go?,7,10
chandler,Had the money in the wrong hand.,7,10
ross,"Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you are going to throw up, do you?",7,10
ben,No.,7,10
ross,"Well, I do, so let's...  So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't you?",7,10
ben,Christmas.,7,10
ross,"Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?",7,10
ben,Christmas eve.,7,10
ross,"Yes, but also  Hanukkah! See, you are part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.",7,10
ben,Santa has reindeers that can fly!,7,10
ross,"Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.",7,10
ben,"Jingle bells, jingle bells...",7,10
ross,"Okay, that is right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.",7,10
ben,"Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...",7,10
ross,"Okay, it's not a contest.",7,10
ben,When is Santa coming?,7,10
ross,"Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?",7,10
ben,No Santa? Was I bad?,7,10
ross,"No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.",7,10
ben,Santa's mad at me.,7,10
ross,"No, hey-hey, come on,  Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you are-you are his favourite little guy!",7,10
ben,So Santa's coming?,7,10
ross,Yes! Santa's coming!,7,10
monica,"It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!",7,10
chandler,How do you know so much about this?,7,10
monica,I don't know.,7,10
chandler,"Richard used to do it, didn't he?",7,10
monica,We'd be eating our soup right now.,7,10
chandler,Moustached bastard...,7,10
monica,"Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!",7,10
chandler,Excuse me...,7,10
male guest,Good evening.,7,10
chandler,Ahh-hahaha!,7,10
rachel,Ha!,7,10
phoebe,"So you like the drums! that is, that is great! You know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!",7,10
joey,"Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...",7,10
rachel and joey,Tequila!!,7,10
phoebe,that is fun.,7,10
gunther,Here you go.,7,10
chandler,"Thank you Gunther, put it there.  Definitely not easier with coins.  Thank you.",7,10
joey,Thank you.   Hey Pheebs!,7,10
phoebe,Hey!,7,10
joey,Here.  Now I only owe you $49.50.,7,10
chandler,Hey Pheebs!,7,10
phoebe,Hey!,7,10
chandler,"If you want to give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?",7,10
monica,"It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!"" I mean, it is so annoying.",7,10
phoebe,"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",7,10
monica,"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't want to live there anymore?",7,10
phoebe,Maybe on some level.,7,10
rachel,"Joey, you know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.",7,10
joey,What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?,7,10
phoebe,"Hey, Joey, I got you another present.",7,10
joey,"Oh wait, before you tell me what it is!  Okay, what is it?",7,10
phoebe,"It's a...tarantula!  Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?",7,10
rachel,"What are you talking about? I love them!  Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?",7,10
joey,"Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!",7,10
rachel,"Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.",7,10
phoebe,"Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you are having so much fun here.",7,10
rachel,"What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?",7,10
phoebe,Our apartment is ready.,7,10
rachel,And that makes you angry because...,7,10
phoebe,Because you would rather live here with Joey.,7,10
rachel,Where did you get that?,7,10
phoebe,Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is going to change that.,7,10
rachel,Phoebe?,7,10
phoebe,Hm?,7,10
rachel,"Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!",7,10
phoebe,Fish!,7,10
rachel,"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are going to live together, we're roommates; that is the deal.",7,10
phoebe,"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you are having so much fun over here...",7,10
rachel,"Oh, it's so much more fun with you.",7,10
phoebe,"We did have fun, didn't we?",7,10
rachel,We did!,7,10
phoebe,"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",7,10
rachel,"Oh, I would love to!",7,10
phoebe,"Yay, okay!",7,10
rachel,"Good, good, good, good, good.",7,10
phoebe,"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",7,10
rachel,Um...  Done!,7,10
ross,Hey!,7,10
salesman,"Hello, Sir. you are here to return those pants?",7,10
ross,"No, these are my pants.",7,10
salesman,Oh. Okay! How can I help you?,7,10
ross,"Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?",7,10
salesman,"Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.",7,10
ross,"Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you got to have something.",7,10
ross,I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!,7,10
monica,"What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?",7,10
ross,Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.,7,10
monica,"Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.",7,10
ben,Texas?,7,10
ross,"that is right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben.  Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.",7,10
ben,Wow! Thanks!,7,10
ross,"you are welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!",7,10
ben,"Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.",7,10
ross,"You are? Me, too!",7,10
monica,Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?,7,10
ross,"You want to wander in the hall?  Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?",7,10
ben,Cool!,7,10
ross,Yeah!,7,10
monica,Come on Ben.,7,10
ross,Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...,7,10
chandler,"Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!",7,10
ben,Santa!,7,10
chandler,Hey!,7,10
ross,"What are you doing here, Santa?",7,10
chandler,"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?",7,10
ross,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?",7,10
chandler,What?,7,10
ben,"Did you bring me any presents, Santa?",7,10
chandler,"You bet I did, Ben, put it there!   Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small!  Ho, ho, ho!",7,10
monica,"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.",7,10
ross,What are you doing?,7,10
chandler,"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!",7,10
ross,"Thank you, but, but you got to leave.",7,10
chandler,Why?,7,10
ross,"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you are-you are wrecking it.",7,10
chandler,But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.,7,10
ross,"I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.",7,10
chandler,"Fine, I'll give the suit back.",7,10
monica,"Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?",7,10
chandler,Santa? Really?,7,10
monica,"Yes, is that okay?",7,10
chandler,Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?,7,10
monica,No.,7,10
chandler,Then it's okay!,7,10
ross,"Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!",7,10
ben,No! Why does he have to go?,7,10
chandler,"Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!",7,10
ben,No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!,7,10
ross,"Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.",7,10
chandler,"Well, I'll stay, but only because I want to hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?",7,10
ben,"Okay, Santa!",7,10
ross,"All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.",7,10
joey,Merry Christmas!,7,10
rachel,Oh wow! Look at this place!,7,10
phoebe,"Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!",7,10
rachel,Oh my God!,7,10
phoebe,What?,7,10
rachel,"Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?",7,10
phoebe,Yeah?,7,10
rachel,And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?,7,10
phoebe,Yeah?,7,10
rachel,Do you really not know where I'm going with this?  It left! It's one huge room!,7,10
phoebe,Oh no!   Oh! Wow!!!,7,10
rachel,See?,7,10
phoebe,"Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.",7,10
rachel,"You can't, because of the new skylight!",7,10
phoebe,There's a skylight?!  Wow!!,7,10
rachel,So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?,7,10
phoebe,"You know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.",7,10
rachel,Oh yeah? Starting' to feel her again there are we?,7,10
phoebe,"A little bit, yeah.",7,10
rachel,Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?,7,10
phoebe,You heard her too?! You have the gift!,7,10
rachel,"Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.",7,10
phoebe,Are you sure?,7,10
rachel,"Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really going to miss living with you.",7,10
phoebe,Oh me too.,7,10
rachel,"I know.  Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm getting' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?",7,10
phoebe,"No, I do not hear that.",7,10
ross,"...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...",7,10
ben,Eight whole days.,7,10
ross,"that is right, and that is why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.",7,10
ben,Awesome!,7,10
ross,Yeah?,7,10
chandler,My favourite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.,7,10
ross,"The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!",7,10
rachel,Hey!,7,10
phoebe,Oh.,7,10
rachel,Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.,7,10
ross,"Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!",7,10
rachel,Oh.,7,10
phoebe,Oh.,7,10
phoebe,"Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?",7,10
rachel,I got it!,7,10
joey,Is it back in the cage?,7,10
rachel,Its back in cage!,7,10
joey,Cage closed?,7,10
rachel,"Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!",7,10
chandler,OH. Mmm.,7,11
rachel,Hi.,7,11
chandler,"Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.",7,11
rachel,"OH, you know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?",7,11
chandler,It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.,7,11
rachel,"Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.  Thief.",7,11
chandler,I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.,7,11
rachel,"Why, why not?",7,11
chandler,Because it's too delicious.,7,11
rachel,"Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.",7,11
chandler,"No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is going to send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  Momma's Little Bakery.  I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.",7,11
rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry what?",7,11
joey,"All right, I should get going, big day a work. You know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.",7,11
chandler,So...,7,11
joey,"Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that is not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?",7,11
phoebe,Absolutely!,7,11
joey,I'll see you at 8,7,11
phoebe,Okay.,7,11
chandler,"Oh, what's at 8",7,11
phoebe,"Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.",7,11
ross,"Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?",7,11
phoebe,Duly noted.,7,11
ross,"Thanks.   Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?",7,11
monica,What are you talking about?,7,11
ross,"Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.",7,11
monica,You were invited?!,7,11
ross,No.,7,11
monica,"My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!",7,11
chandler,"Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.",7,11
ross,"Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.",7,11
monica,"Yeah, well you call her and tell her that you know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.",7,11
ross,"You know, she tried to undress me too.",7,11
chandler,I used to undress my cousin Glenn.,7,11
phoebe,Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!,7,11
rachel,"Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?",7,11
phoebe,"Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.",7,11
rachel,"""Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy.""  Big Daddy?",7,11
phoebe,Oh that is a nickname we were trying out.,7,11
ross,"Hey, you know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!",7,11
joey,Hey!,7,11
phoebe,Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!,7,11
joey,Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!,7,11
phoebe,So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!,7,11
joey,"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!",7,11
ross,"Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.",7,11
phoebe,"I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! You know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!",7,11
joey,Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.,7,11
phoebe,"Well, it does.",7,11
joey,"Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry.  How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!",7,11
phoebe,"Okay, you wore me down.",7,11
ross,"Hey Joe, while you are over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?",7,11
joey,The Ross-Is that back?!!,7,11
rachel,Hi!,7,11
chandler,Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!,7,11
rachel,"So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?",7,11
chandler,I can't seem to say goodbye.,7,11
rachel,"Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?",7,11
chandler,Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!,7,11
rachel,"It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling...  Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!",7,11
chandler,You know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.,7,11
rachel,Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.,7,11
chandler,Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?,7,11
rachel,"Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.",7,11
joey,Aww! Mel Torme died.,7,11
monica,"Joey, that paper's like a year old!",7,11
joey,Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!,7,11
ross,Hey.,7,11
joey,Hey.,7,11
monica,Hey.,7,11
ross,"So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.",7,11
monica,Limited seating?!  I am just one tiny person!,7,11
ross,"Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.",7,11
monica,"Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! that is not the reason she's not inviting me!",7,11
ross,"Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and you know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.",7,11
monica,Joan?,7,11
ross,"Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!",7,11
monica,"Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got ""and guest?!""",7,11
joey,"Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here you know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...",7,11
ross,Not broad backed!,7,11
monica,"Wait a minute, you know, you are bringing me!",7,11
ross,What? I can't cancel on Joan!,7,11
monica,Why not?!,7,11
ross,"Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?",7,11
monica,"Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family you know? Well that is important to me.",7,11
ross,"Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.",7,11
joey,"Aww that is nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.",7,11
monica,We'll see.,7,11
chandler,"Well, thank you for lunch.",7,11
rachel,"What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!",7,11
chandler,So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?,7,11
rachel,Its still there!,7,11
chandler,Mrs. Braverman must be out.,7,11
rachel,She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.,7,11
chandler,"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.",7,11
rachel,No that could kill her.,7,11
chandler,"Well, we don't want that.",7,11
rachel,No so we're protecting her.,7,11
chandler,But we should take it.,7,11
rachel,But we should move quick.,7,11
chandler,Why?,7,11
rachel,Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.,7,11
chandler,Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!,7,11
phoebe,Oh my God! that is David!,7,11
monica,David who?,7,11
phoebe,"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!",7,11
david,Oh my God!,7,11
phoebe,"Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.",7,11
david,Phoebe?,7,11
phoebe,David!  What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?,7,11
david,"Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!",7,11
phoebe,Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?,7,11
david,Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.,7,11
phoebe,Yeah.,7,11

chandler,What do we use to split it?,7,11
rachel,"Okay!  All right, pick a half.",7,11
chandler,"Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. You know? So, maybe if I measured...",7,11

tag,"I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.",7,12
rachel,"You know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.",7,12

joey,"All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.",7,12
ross,"Ugh. Well, we're just going to have to jump.  Yeah. Now, we're going to have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.",7,12
joey,Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!,7,12

tag,So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?,7,12
rachel,"In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it  that said, ""Must go out today."" So you just keep looking in there! All right?",7,12
tag,It's not here.,7,12
rachel,"Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?",7,12

phoebe,"Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!",7,12
the fireman,"Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.",7,12
phoebe,Fine!  But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!,7,12
the fireman,There's a reset button under the plastic cover.,7,12
phoebe,"There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you!  There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that!  Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?  Oh here it is!  Oh!  OH, God!",7,12
ross,"Okay, do-do you have a good grip?",7,12
joey,Yeah!,7,12
ross,"Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.",7,12
joey,All right! Just hurry up!,7,12
ross,Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.,7,12
joey,I think face to face.,7,12
ross,I would say that.,7,12
joey,"Face to face, yeah!",7,12
ross,"Okay, here I go.",7,12
joey,All right.,7,12
joey,Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!,7,12
ross,"I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.",7,12
joey,"You know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.",7,12
ross,So what do you want me to do?,7,12
joey,"Well, just shimmy down me and drop!",7,12
ross,Hi.,7,12
joey,Hi.,7,12
ross,M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.,7,12
joey,Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!,7,12
ross,It's still looks pretty far!,7,12
joey,It's not that far! Just drop!,7,12
ross,Do not rush me!!,7,12
joey,"Ross, you should know that my pants are starting' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!",7,12
ross,"Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!",7,12
monica,That really was some of your best work.,7,12
chandler,"Hm-hmm, I told you!  I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.",7,12
monica,I have to be up in seven minutes.,7,12
chandler,"Well, you are not going to believe this, but if you have seven minutes...",7,12
monica,Really?!,7,12
chandler,Do you want to?,7,12
monica,Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!,7,12
joey,Hey.,7,13
rachel,Hey.,7,13
joey,What are you doing?,7,13
rachel,"Well, you know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.",7,13
joey,Why would you want to do that?,7,13
rachel,So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.,7,13
joey,"Rach, there is a decent place to...",7,13
rachel,And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.,7,13
joey,No. No. No.,7,13
rachel,No?,7,13
joey,No. Rosita does not move.,7,13
rachel,"I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...",7,13
joey,As in Rosita does not move.,7,13
rachel,"Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?",7,13
joey,The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.,7,13
rachel,Stevie the TV?,7,13
joey,Is there a problem?,7,13
rachel,"No!  Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together!  You bitch!",7,13
ross,"Hey, you know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you are going to have to say, ""This is my brother-in-law Ross."" Not, ""My friend Ross,"" ""brother-in-law Ross."" that is weird isn't it?",7,13
chandler,"Couldn't I just say, ""This is Ross?""",7,13
ross,"Sure, do whatever you want.",7,13
monica,"Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...",7,13
ross,Yeah?,7,13
monica,Look at this.,7,13
ross,"Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!",7,13
phoebe,What? What happened to the window in the attic?!,7,13
monica,I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!,7,13
ross,I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!,7,13
phoebe,I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!,7,13
ross,"Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!  Yes we're surprised!  Who did you leave a message with?",7,13
chandler,Sorry!,7,13
rachel,"Joey, Joey I am so sorry.",7,13
joey,"I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?",7,13
rachel,"Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.",7,13
joey,She's not even cold yet!,7,13
rachel,"But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean you know, she did always put...your comfort first.",7,13
joey,that is true.,7,13
rachel,Okay? You ready?,7,13
joey,"Yeah, I...  I don't want Stevie to see her like this.",7,13
ross,"I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's going to be living in my room.",7,13
monica,"Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.",7,13
ross,They kept your room for a while.,7,13
monica,"Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I got to say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!",7,13
ross,"Come on, you know they love you.",7,13
monica,As much as they love you?,7,13
ross,I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It's not my fault.,7,13
phoebe,Hey.,7,13
ross,Hey.,7,13
monica,Hey!,7,13
phoebe,"Ugh, I hate this year!",7,13
ross,What's wrong with this year?,7,13
phoebe,"Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!",7,13
monica,That was me and Ross.,7,13
phoebe,Oh that is right!,7,13
ross,"Hey, you know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.",7,13
monica,Oh that is a great idea. you are really good on the phone.,7,13
phoebe,"Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. You know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.",7,13
ross,What?,7,13
phoebe,"Oh yeah, like you never called!",7,13
supervisor,So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.,7,13
phoebe,"Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.",7,13
supervisor,Why don't we do a trial run.,7,13
phoebe,"Oh okay. Umm, all right.  Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?",7,13
supervisor,I'm the supply manager.,7,13
phoebe,"Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.",7,13
supervisor,We don't need any toner.,7,13
phoebe,"Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.  Yeah you are right, this is easy.",7,13
supervisor,"Okay, what was wrong with that call?",7,13
phoebe,"Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.",7,13
supervisor,"They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that is okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.",7,13
phoebe,Oh.,7,13
supervisor,"So, I think you are ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?",7,13
phoebe,"No.  Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?",7,13
chandler,"Joey! Joe!  Full bag.  Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here!  Oh no-no-no-no-no-no!  Stevie, I was never here!",7,13
ross,Dad?,7,13
mr. geller,I'm here!,7,13
ross,Hey!,7,13
mr. geller,"Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.",7,13
ross,"Dad, we-we can't believe you are selling the house.",7,13
mr. geller,"Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.",7,13
ross,Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.,7,13
mr. geller,I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.,7,13
monica,"Oh, that is okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...",7,13
mr. geller,"Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.",7,13
monica,I used to love to play restaurant.,7,13
ross,"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.",7,13
monica,"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!",7,13
mr. geller,"So, I think you are boxes are over here.",7,13
ross,"Wow! Great!  Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?",7,13
mr. geller,"I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.",7,13
ross,"Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad,  Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Ooh, my rock polisher!",7,13
mr. geller,"Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!",7,13
ross,It's a clown kit! Clown kit!,7,13
mr. geller,"Well, the white seems to be untouched.  Uh-oh.",7,13
ross,What?,7,13
mr. geller,You know how the garage floods every Spring?,7,13
ross,How are you ever going to sell this place?,7,13
mr. geller,I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.,7,13
ross,"Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's going to be crushed!",7,13
mr. geller,You don't secretly smoke do you?,7,13
ross,No!,7,13
mr. geller,So it's just your mother then.,7,13
phoebe,"Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?  Earl, thanks.  Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.",7,13
earl,I don't need any toner.,7,13
phoebe,"I'm hearing what you are saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.",7,13
earl,Not me.,7,13
phoebe,May I ask why?,7,13
earl,You want to know why. You want to know why?,7,13
phoebe,I surely do!,7,13
earl,"Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself.",7,13
phoebe,"Umm, is-is that because you are out of toner?",7,13
earl,"Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.",7,13
phoebe,No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.,7,13
earl,Well...I only have one thing to do today.,7,13
phoebe,"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?",7,13
earl,"It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!",7,13
phoebe,Chandler?,7,13
earl,I-I'm sorry?,7,13
phoebe,"No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!",7,13
earl,"Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on.  Hey everybody! Uh, I'm going to kill myself!  I'll get back to you.  I got nothing. Wait.  Uh, hey Marge!   Ehh, nothing. Nothing.",7,13
chandler,"My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!",7,13
rachel,You will like it!,7,13
joey,No I won't.,7,13
rachel,You don't even know!,7,13
joey,"Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!",7,13
rachel,"Well look, if you don't like this...",7,13
joey,I don't know why you say that so soon.,7,13
rachel,"Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, you know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.",7,13
joey,Francette? What is she? A couch?,7,13
joey,Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.,7,13
rachel,"Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. you know, start the heeling process?",7,13
joey,"Well, I guess you are right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's going to be so said, and kind of cool.  She's heeled!",7,13
rachel,that is weird.,7,13
joey,"No it's not weird, it's a miracle!",7,13
rachel,It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.,7,13
joey,"Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!",7,13
rachel,"Joey, I really don't...",7,13
joey,Can you tell me how this happened?,7,13
rachel,Well no.,7,13
joey,Miracle!,7,13
rachel,"No, you know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!",7,13
joey,Someone like an...angel?,7,13
rachel,"that is right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.",7,13
joey,Get your non-believer ass out of my chair!,7,13
mr. geller,"Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.",7,13
ross,"Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.",7,13
mr. geller,"Oh my God, does she really thinks that?",7,13
ross,"Well, can you blame her?",7,13
mr. geller,"Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favoured you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could...",7,13
ross,"Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.",7,13
mr. geller,Really?,7,13
ross,"Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're going to give her some! Okay, grab...grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put them in their.",7,13
mr. geller,Great!,7,13
ross,Like  know like this! This!  She-she could've made this!,7,13
mr. geller,Sure!,7,13
ross,Right? And this!  She-she could've won this!,7,13
mr. geller,This could've been hers!,7,13
ross,"Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?",7,13
mr. geller,Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.,7,13
rachel,I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!,7,13
joey,"Yeah, me too.",7,13
rachel,"Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?",7,13
joey,Fine.,7,13
rachel,"Yeah? Wow! You know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!",7,13
joey,No. Really?,7,13
rachel,Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!,7,13
joey,My chair heels itself.,7,13
phoebe,"Earl, you are not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you are not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!",7,13
guy,Hey guy!,7,13
phoebe,"Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.",7,13
earl,"No! that is just the ""Hey Guy"" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!",7,13
phoebe,"All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's got to be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?",7,13
earl,Yeah! Right!,7,13
phoebe,"Oh sorry, boyfriend!",7,13
earl,Oh no.,7,13
phoebe,"No, whatever! Anything!",7,13
"the ""hey guy"" guy",Hey guy!,7,13
phoebe,"Yeah, he's got to go.",7,13
earl,"Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See you.",7,13
phoebe,No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!,7,13
supervisor,The new girl's good.,7,13
monica,Hey guys! Hey!,7,13
ross,Hey.,7,13
monica,"Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.",7,13
mr. geller,that is a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!,7,13
ross,"Yeah! Yeah!  Oh, this will make a great memory.",7,13
monica,"Okay. So, which boxes are mine?",7,13
ross,"Well, these. These are yours right here.",7,13
monica,Okay.  Oh! A colouring book!,7,13
ross,"Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that colouring book.",7,13
monica,Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.,7,13
ross,Nu-uh!,7,13
monica,"Oh, an old glove?",7,13
mr. geller,"Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.",7,13
monica,Wow! Look at this!  I can't believe I even fit into this shirt!,7,13
ross,"Oh, I don't know how that got in there.",7,13
monica,"This isn't mine.  Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross!  These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?",7,13
ross,"Umm, your boxes are umm...",7,13
monica,What?,7,13
ross,Dad?,7,13
mr. geller,"Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry.",7,13
monica,Just mine?,7,13
mr. geller,I'm afraid so.,7,13
monica,So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined?  And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!,7,13
mr. geller,"Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.",7,13
monica,"So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!",7,13
mr. geller,There was also leaves and guk and stuff.,7,13
monica,I can't believe this!,7,13
mr. geller,Screw it! I'm having one.,7,13
rachel,Hey Chandler!,7,13
chandler,Hey!,7,13
rachel,"How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?",7,13
chandler,"Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.",7,13
rachel,"Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?",7,13
chandler,Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?,7,13
rachel,I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.,7,13
chandler,that is awesome! that is great! What made you do it?!,7,13
rachel,"Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...",7,13
chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?,7,13
rachel,Yeah.,7,13
chandler,I thought I broke Joey's chair! that is why I replaced it with mine!,7,13
rachel,oh. that is how it got fixed!,7,13
chandler,"Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?",7,13
rachel,No!  Angels.,7,13
chandler,I'm getting' my chair back!,7,13
rachel,What? Wh-hey!,7,13
joey,"Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!",7,13
chandler,Joey you broke my chair!!,7,13
joey,Your chair?!,7,13
rachel,"Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!",7,13
joey,"So, there was no miracle?!",7,13
rachel,"No Joe, no miracle.",7,13
joey,Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.,7,13
rachel,"Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back!",7,13
chandler,I think I should get the chair!,7,13
joey,How do you figure?,7,13
chandler,"Because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!",7,13
rachel,No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.,7,13
chandler,"Well, where's the logic in that?!",7,13
rachel,"The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!",7,13
chandler,So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!,7,13
joey,that is right!,7,13
chandler,What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!,7,13
joey,Yeah! We are!,7,13
rachel,We're the Cobras!,7,13
phoebe,Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.,7,13
marge,"Sorry, I don't know any Earl.",7,13
earl,I'm right here!!!!,7,13
phoebe,Earl! I'm Phoebe.,7,13
earl,Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?,7,13
phoebe,"Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.",7,13
earl,"Look, um I really appreciate your coming down...",7,13
phoebe,No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!,7,13
earl,Why?!,7,13
phoebe,Because it was fate that made me call you today!,7,13
earl,I thought it was toner.,7,13
phoebe,"No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you are my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.",7,13
earl,Really?!,7,13
phoebe,Yes.,7,13
earl,How?,7,13
phoebe,I'm not going to give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.,7,13
earl,Couldn't it just be a coincidence?,7,13
phoebe,"No, it's fate!",7,13
earl,It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.,7,13
phoebe,"Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.",7,13
earl,I'm actually the office manager.,7,13
phoebe,"Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.",7,13
earl,"Well, was there anything else?!",7,13
phoebe,"Sure!  Umm, where are you from?",7,13
earl,Philadelphia.,7,13
phoebe,"Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.",7,13
earl,Really?,7,13
phoebe,"Well, you know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.",7,13
earl,Yeah-yeah.,7,13
phoebe,"But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!",7,13
earl,Did you hear that?! I don't need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe!   I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.,7,13
phoebe,"You know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place.  Hey! Guys!   Oh no, it's you.",7,13
earl,Yeah.,7,13
monica,"Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this.  It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! OH, it's still soft.  What do you think this is?",7,13
ross,All right. I think it was a mouse.,7,13
mr. geller,How are you honey?,7,13
monica,How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!,7,13
mr. geller,"Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.",7,13
monica,What's this?,7,13
mr. geller,"It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.",7,13
monica,What?!,7,13
ross,What?!!!,7,13
mr. geller,"I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.",7,13
monica,"Wait, you are giving me your Porsche, you are kidding me right?!",7,13
ross,"Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!",7,13

tag,Hey.,7,14
chandler,She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.,7,14
tag,Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or  they still look pretty damn good.,7,14
joey,They do!,7,14
phoebe,Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!,7,14
monica,Chocolate-chip pancakes!,7,14
ross,We've got presents!,7,14
rachel,Good ones?,7,14
monica,They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.,7,14
rachel,"Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?",7,14
joey,"Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.",7,14
ross,Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?,7,14
joey,Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!,7,14
rachel,"You know, I'm still 29 in Guam.",7,14
ross,"Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?",7,14
rachel,Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?,7,14
chandler,"No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.",7,14
joey,And now Chandler! We're all getting' so old!  Why are you doing this to us?!,7,14
monica,"Rach, you are in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...",7,14
joey,"Yeah, you are roommate is a soap opera star.",7,14
rachel,"Look, you know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.",7,14
phoebe,"Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.",7,14
all,Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!,7,14
rachel,There you go!,7,14
phoebe,"I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! that is it!! that is everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!!  And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.",7,14
rachel,"Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!",7,14
tag,"Come on, let's have some fun. Huh?  What do you want to do today?",7,14
rachel,Nothing. I don't want to do anything.,7,14
monica,"Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.",7,14
ross,Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!,7,14
ross,"How hot do I look in this, huh?!",7,14
chandler,"Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?",7,14
ross,that is not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.,7,14
joey,"Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?",7,14
ross,"I don't know, but-but look how shiny!",7,14
monica,I can't believe you bought this.,7,14
rachel,"Really! God Ross, what were you thinking?  I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.",7,14
phoebe,"Oh, well get in line missy.  So, can I have a ride stud?",7,14
ross,Hop in.  Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.,7,14
ross,Damnit!,7,14
phoebe,"Okay, who's next?",7,14
rachel,"You know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just going to sit around like some old lady. I'm going to get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.",7,14
phoebe,Really?! -Because you know that hurts.,7,14
rachel,So what?!you know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!,7,14
tag,"Look Rachel, I know what you are going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.",7,14
rachel,"Get out, get out of my apartment.",7,14
monica,"All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you are doing great. I mean you know let's face it, no one handles this well.",7,14
phoebe,Least of all you.,7,14
tag,Why? What you'd do?,7,14
monica,Weren't you asked to leave sonny?,7,14
chandler,Would you put that back on?! Monica's going to be here any minute!,7,14
joey,But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.,7,14
chandler,"Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.",7,14
mrs. geller,You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.,7,14
chandler,"Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter!  And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that is thirty years old!",7,14
mr. geller,It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.,7,14
chandler,OH!,7,14
rachel,Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!,7,14
chandler,Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!,7,14
mr. geller,Crap.,7,14
chandler,"Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.",7,14
monica,Hey!! You got the door open!!,7,14
chandler,Hey-hey are you drunk?,7,14
monica,"No!  Okay.  Whoa!  Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning  thirty.  So the bus boys took me out for some drinks.  I want to puke on you later!",7,14
chandler,"Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!",7,14
monica,No!!!,7,14
chandler,Yes!,7,14
monica,No!!,7,14
chandler,Yes!!,7,14
monica,Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.,7,14
chandler,"Okay, here's the thing. We're going to get you some coffee and they will never know that you are drunk.",7,14
monica,Really?! You promise?,7,14
chandler,"Yeah, I'll take care of it.",7,14
monica,Okay. I love you so much.,7,14
chandler,Okay we have to do something about your breath.,7,14
monica,What about your breath?!,7,14
chandler,"that is still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.",7,14
monica,Okay. I can do that.,7,14
chandler,Okay.,7,14
all,Surprise!!!,7,14
ross,"Okay, forward. Forward-Stop!  Okay, back-Stop!  Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!",7,14
monica,"Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.",7,14
woman,Is this yours?,7,14
joey,Well actually...,7,14
ross,No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine.,7,14
joey,"Dude, you so need this car.",7,14
phoebe,"Okay. Okay, here's what we're going to do. Okay, I'm going to break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go.  Haul ass!!!!",7,14
phoebe,"Happy thirtieth birthday! Here!  It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!",7,14
ursula,"Right, why do you keep saying that?",7,14
phoebe,Because it's our thirtieth birthday.,7,14
ursula,"Yeah, no we're not thirty. We're 31. Okay.",7,14
phoebe,Wait!,7,14
ursula,"Oh, it's you.",7,14
phoebe,Yeah. What?!,7,14
ursula,"Yeah, we're not thirty, we're 31.",7,14
phoebe,Nu-uh!,7,14
ursula,Yea-huh! that is what is says on my birth certificate.,7,14
phoebe,You have your birth certificate?,7,14
ursula,"Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.",7,14
phoebe,Our mom.,7,14
ursula,Right! Okay.,7,14
phoebe,Do you have my birth certificate?,7,14
ursula,"No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.",7,14
phoebe,"Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.",7,14
ursula,Yeah.,7,14
phoebe,I just lost a whole year of my life.,7,14
ursula,Okay.,7,14
phoebe,Your middle name is Pamela?,7,14
ursula,Yes.,7,14
phoebe,"Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?",7,14
ursula,Yes! Phoebe.,7,14
phoebe,that is my first name.,7,14
ursula,"Right, okay, then no.",7,14
chandler,"Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.",7,14
monica,Yay!,7,14
chandler,See?  Here we go.,7,14
mr. geller,"Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!",7,14
mrs. geller,Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.,7,14
monica,Paul!,7,14
chandler,Phil.,7,14
monica,Phil!,7,14
chandler,"Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed.  Okay,  you are doing great. you are doing great. you are doing fine.",7,14
phoebe,"Hey, what's going on?",7,14
chandler,Monica's a little drunk.,7,14
phoebe,Yay! I love drunk Monica!,7,14
monica,Aww...,7,14
chandler,Go change!  She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.,7,14
phoebe,"OH! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.",7,14
rachel,What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!,7,14
chandler,Monica's wasted.,7,14
ross,Maybe that will liven up this party.,7,14
chandler,"Okay, will you just go help her change please!",7,14
rachel,"Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.",7,14
joey,Yep.,7,14
tag,This one's from me.,7,14
rachel,Ahh!,7,14
tag,"It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.",7,14
rachel,A scooter!,7,14
ross,Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.,7,14
rachel,"No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.",7,14
chandler,"Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!",7,14
rachel,Okay.,7,14
joey,"Now that you are a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?",7,14
chandler,"For my last birthday you gave me a hug!  Okay, read the card! Read the card!",7,14
rachel,"Okay.  Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill  then buried under it.  All our love Monica and Chandler.  that is funny, yeah!",7,14
chandler,No-no-no-no! That was the joke!,7,14
rachel,"No, I know! I get it! It's funny!",7,14
chandler,"No, because you are not a grandmother!",7,14
rachel,"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. that is why it's so funny.",7,14
monica,All you had to do was buy the card!,7,14
ross,Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?,7,14
rachel,"Well, I feel fine, but I think you are bumming out the rest of the kids.",7,14
ross,What?,7,14
rachel,Okay! You know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I want to have three kids...,7,14
phoebe,"Oh let me guess, and you want to have them all at the same time and you want to have them for your brother.",7,14
rachel,As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I want to marry this plan!,7,14
phoebe,"If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.",7,14
rachel,"So, if I want to have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...",7,14
monica,"Really! That long?!   Look all you want, it's happening!",7,14
rachel,"No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! that is three years, that is three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.",7,14
ross,Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!,7,14
rachel,"No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I want to marry!",7,14
joey,Will you quit hoggin' it!,7,14
rachel,I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.,7,14
ross,you are drunk! Mom and dad are going to be mad! Maybe I'm a little drunk.,7,14
chandler,Oh that is great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please?  There we go.,7,14
joey,Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell you to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?,7,14
chandler,How are you feeling?,7,14
monica,"You are so handsome! I want to make love to you right here, right now!",7,14
ross,I really wish that you wouldn't.,7,14
chandler,"Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.",7,14
phoebe,Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?,7,14
chandler,Pheebs!!,7,14
phoebe,Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!,7,14
mrs. geller,Speech! Come on Monica!,7,14
ross,Come on!,7,14
all,Come on! Speech!,7,14
mr. geller,"Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!",7,14
mrs. geller,"Oh-ho, I think it's nice.",7,14
chandler,I think it's necessary.,7,14
monica,I-I-I want to thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...,7,14
phoebe,Wooo!! Hoo!!,7,14
monica,"I really like to say that I'm-um... you know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!!  that is right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!!  And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.",7,14
phoebe,"Okay quick, help me get this off!",7,14
joey,Yeah!!,7,14
phoebe,I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!,7,14
joey,"Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.",7,14
phoebe,"Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?",7,14
joey,that is not going to happen. No.  Because we have a new deal!,7,14
phoebe,"Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!",7,14
joey,Like what?,7,14
phoebe,"Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!",7,14
monica,"Phoebe, you know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?",7,14
phoebe,"No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.",7,14
rachel,"Hey.  Oh, poor Pheebs.",7,14
joey,"Hey, you know what you guys? I think I'm going to go walk her home.",7,14
monica,Oh man!,7,14
chandler,What?,7,14
monica,He's going to eat the cake!,7,14
joey,"Pheebs! Wait up!  Listen uh, close your eyes.  Maybe that is one thing you can cross off your list.",7,14
phoebe,Oh yeah.,7,14
joey,"Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.",7,14
phoebe,Oh!,7,14
ross,"Okay, is everybody clear? We're going to pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're going to lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!",7,14
rachel,"Ross, I really don't think...",7,14
ross,Lift!! And slide!,7,14
chandler,"Okay, here we go.",7,14
ross,"All right everyone, lift!  And slide!!",7,14
rachel,"Hey Joey, can I...",7,14
joey,"Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!",7,14
rachel,"Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.",7,14
joey,"Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?",7,14
rachel,"Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.",7,14
joey,Okay!,7,14
rachel,Not in the street!!,7,14
joey,Yes!,7,14
rachel,Hi.,7,14

rachel,"Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.",7,14
tag,Okay.,7,14
rachel,Umm...,7,14
tag,What's up?,7,14
rachel,"OH Tag, umm...you are such a great guy and we have so much fun together but I don't-I don't...",7,14
tag,"Wait! I think I see where you are going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?",7,14
rachel,"Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can you know, just have fun.",7,14
tag,"Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you are turning thirty.",7,14
rachel,"Yeah, it is! But you are just a kid! I mean you are 25!",7,14
tag,Twenty-four actually.,7,14
rachel,"Oh God! You know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishing' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.",7,14
tag,Me too.,7,14
rachel,"Yeah, I'm sorry.",7,14
chandler,Hey! How'd it go?,7,14
rachel,"Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?",7,14
phoebe,You did the right thing.,7,14
joey,I don't like this anymore.,7,14
chandler,"Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.",7,14
ross,"God, do you realize in ten years we're going to be 40?",7,14
joey,Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!,7,14
ross,Yes! My baby's finally free!,7,14
joey,All-all right!  Start it up! Let's go!,7,14
ross,Woohoo!,7,14
the man in the sportscar,How hot are we?,7,14
ross,You want to buy a car?,7,14
joey,No.,7,14
monica,"I'm glad you are here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.",7,15
rachel,OH...,7,15
ross,What's the matter? You okay?,7,15
rachel,"Yeah, it's just you know...",7,15
chandler,Monica said wedding.,7,15
monica,"Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.",7,15
rachel,Oh! I would love to read a poem.,7,15
chandler,Do you think you could get through a poem?,7,15
rachel,It'll be a short one.,7,15
monica,"Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.",7,15
rachel,oh...,7,15
ross,"Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.",7,15
chandler,Too?,7,15
ross,"Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.",7,15
monica,Do you mind telling us what it is?,7,15
ross,"Sorry, I'm kind of keeping this one on the Q.T.",7,15
chandler,"Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.",7,15
joey,Hey!,7,15
all,Hey!,7,15
joey,"So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...",7,15
monica,What is DOOL?,7,15
joey,"Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you are not going to believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!",7,15
all,Oh!!,7,15
chandler,that is great!,7,15
joey,"And-and-and not only that, I'm getting' a new brain!!",7,15
chandler,So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!,7,15
rachel,"Wait, what do you mean you are getting a new brain?",7,15
joey,"Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.",7,15
ross,What? A brain transplant?!,7,15
joey,"Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.",7,15
ross,It's ridiculous!,7,15
joey,"Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.",7,15
ross,"It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.",7,15
monica,Who are they killing off?,7,15
joey,"Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.",7,15
rachel and monica,No!!,7,15
monica,She's my favourite character on DOOL.,7,15
joey,Nice.,7,15
rachel,"She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.",7,15
monica,And the way she slaps all the time!,7,15
rachel,Oh!,7,15
monica,Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!,7,15
chandler,Don't do it.,7,15
rachel,"Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.",7,15
joey,"Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's going to be really hard to fill her shoes.",7,15
ross,"Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the ""brain transplant,"" you are going to be her?",7,15
joey,"Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.  Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!",7,15
phoebe,"Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?",7,15
rachel,"Well, I'd have to say gay.",7,15
phoebe,Yeah? Why?,7,15
rachel,Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.,7,15
phoebe,Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.,7,15
rachel,Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.,7,15
phoebe,OH knockers will help us figure it out.,7,15
rachel,"All right, straight, and not subtle.",7,15
phoebe,"OH, he left his cell phone.",7,15
rachel,"Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.",7,15
phoebe,Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.,7,15
rachel,"What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.",7,15
phoebe,Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.,7,15
rachel,What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?,7,15
phoebe,I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.,7,15
rachel,"Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.",7,15
phoebe,"That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.",7,15
rachel,"Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.",7,15
phoebe,No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.,7,15
rachel,"Yeah!  And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.",7,15
phoebe,Nice try.,7,15
rachel,Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?,7,15
phoebe,I don't know.,7,15
rachel,"Well umm, maybe we could uhh...  Ah-ha! Too slow!!",7,15
phoebe,Ah-ha! Too cocky!,7,15
dina,"I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!",7,15
jessica lockhart,Oh yes there is!,7,15
dina,What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!,7,15
jessica lockhart,That was an accident! And so were you.,7,15
dina,"Well, at least I'm not a murderer!",7,15
jessica lockhart,"Oh, my baby!",7,15
the director,Cut!,7,15
joey,That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?,7,15
cecilia,"Oh, just years of experience.",7,15
dina,Can I get some ice here?!,7,15
joey,"Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.",7,15
cecilia,you are not the fan who's dying are you?,7,15
joey,Say what?,7,15
cecilia,"I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that is not supposed to be until  later!",7,15
joey,"No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!",7,15
cecilia,Oh that was a real person?!,7,15
joey,"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...",7,15
cecilia,I-I-I'm leaving the show?,7,15
joey,I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?,7,15
cecilia,Who told you that?,7,15
joey,"Oh uh, one of the writers.",7,15
cecilia,Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?,7,15
joey,Umm...,7,15
cecilia,You know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!,7,15
joey,Okay.,7,15
cecilia,"And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip!",7,15
joey,Ms. Monroe...  Oh there you go.,7,15
rachel,"No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that is not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.",7,15
phoebe,"Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.",7,15
rachel,I don't think so.,7,15
phoebe,"Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.",7,15
rachel,"All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.",7,15
phoebe,"OH, I lost my mom to suicide.",7,15
rachel,"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.",7,15
phoebe,Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.,7,15
rachel,Yes okay.  Well now see this isn't telling us anything.  Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!,7,15
phoebe,"Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that is one for you.",7,15
rachel,"Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.",7,15
phoebe,"So you don't know that is Barney's the store! That can be you know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?",7,15
rachel,His new girlfriend!,7,15
monica,What is that?,7,15
chandler,I think it's the dying cat parade.,7,15
monica,It sounds like it's coming from across the street.,7,15
chandler,Oh my God!,7,15
monica,What?,7,15
chandler,"You know that thing that Ross was going to do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""you are half Scottish right?""",7,15
monica,No!!,7,15
chandler,Yes!!,7,15
monica,"No, there is no way! It can not be Ross!  Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!",7,15
chandler,Why is your family Ross?!,7,15
monica,"He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!",7,15
chandler,"If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.",7,15
rachel,Hi Pheebs!,7,15
phoebe,Hi!,7,15
rachel,How are you?,7,15
phoebe,Good.,7,15
rachel,"Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?",7,15
phoebe,Yeah.,7,15
rachel,And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?,7,15
phoebe,Yeah!,7,15
rachel,And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!,7,15
phoebe,"Ooh, now you lost me.",7,15
rachel,You stole the phone!,7,15
phoebe,No I didn't!,7,15
rachel,"No? So you are saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?",7,15
phoebe,No.,7,15
rachel,"Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!",7,15
rachel,Phoebe!,7,15
phoebe,That is a different phone.,7,15
rachel,"Oh is it?!  Uhh, hello?  Yes hi, is Rachel there?  Yes she is, just one moment please.  It's for me!",7,15
phoebe,That is damning evidence.,7,15
rachel,Oh my God! I bet that is him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh  Hello? Or should I be  Hi! It's Rach...  Would you stop doing that?!,7,15
phoebe,"Hello?  Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.",7,15
rachel,Phoebe! You can't do th...,7,15
phoebe,"Shh! I'm on a call!  Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8",7,15
rachel,You do know that I will be here when he comes over.,7,15
phoebe,Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?,7,15
rachel,You just said it!,7,15
phoebe,"Oh. Okay, well I-I was kind of hoping that I would just...be alone you know to think about my mom and her suicide.",7,15
rachel,Oh Phoebe!,7,15
phoebe,What?! that is the first time today!,7,15
rachel,OH!,7,15
joey,So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...,7,15
dina,I'm 16.,7,15
joey,See you in 2003.,7,15
cecilia,"you are absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that is it.",7,15
joey,"I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.",7,15
cecilia,"Yeah, thanks.",7,15
joey,No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!,7,15
cecilia,Oh you are right. Thank you! What's your name again?,7,15
joey,Joey.,7,15
cecilia,"Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.",7,15
the writer,It wasn't my decision!,7,15
cecilia,I'm having a conversation here!  You were saying?,7,15
joey,"Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. You know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. You know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?",7,15
cecilia,"All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.",7,15
joey,Oh that is great! Oh thank you so much!,7,15
cecilia,you are so welcome.,7,15
joey,"Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this?  ""Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!""",7,15
cecilia,Is that supposed to be me?,7,15
joey,Yeah.,7,15
cecilia,Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.,7,15
joey,I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!,7,15
chandler,"Well, I feel like a snack!",7,15
monica,Do you want some shortbread? Eh that is Scottish like you are.,7,15
chandler,Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.,7,15
ross,What?!,7,15
chandler,"Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.",7,15
ross,"Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.",7,15
monica,No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But you know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.,7,15
ross,Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...,7,15
monica,You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!,7,15
ross,How did you know about that?!,7,15
chandler,We heard you play all the way from your apartment!,7,15
ross,Were you the ones called the cops?!,7,15
chandler,"that is not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.",7,15
ross,Why not?,7,15
chandler,Because we hate them.,7,15
ross,Come on that is not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!,7,15
chandler,We have heard you play.,7,15
ross,"No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm going to play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.",7,15
cecilia,"So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.  You try.",7,15
joey,Okay!  All right!,7,15
cecilia,"No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.",7,15
joey,Okay. Okay.,7,15
cecilia,"Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!!  All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better.  Oh well, I'm going to miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.",7,15
joey,"Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. You know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. you are so talented.",7,15
cecilia,"I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.",7,15
joey,"Hey that is not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!",7,15
cecilia,"I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but you know I just got so comfy here! And... OH, I turned down some amazing work!",7,15
joey,Like-like what?,7,15
cecilia,"Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!",7,15
joey,Wow!,7,15
cecilia,"But... Well now, now's a different time for me.",7,15
joey,"Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, ""Boy, she-she is a great actress!""  Uh but-but, I am also thinking, ""She is hot!""",7,15
cecilia,You think I'm hot?,7,15
joey,You own the room.  We should probably get-get uh...,7,15
cecilia,"Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the...  So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.",7,15
joey,"Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that Because she's so passionate?",7,15
cecilia,No! It's because that way the camera only sees her!  Do you want to try it?,7,15
joey,Yeah! Okay.,7,15
cecilia,"That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like...",7,15
rachel,Hey! Hey!,7,15
phoebe and rachel,Who is it?,7,15
guy,"Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to pick up the phone.",7,15
phoebe,Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?,7,15
rachel,Well why shouldn't I?!,7,15
phoebe,Because it's my apartment!,7,15
rachel,"Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.",7,15
phoebe,Okay. All right.  Good luck explaining all the calls to China.,7,15

rachel,I know!  What?!,7,15
phoebe,"Hmm, they just don't make them like that anymore!",7,15
rachel,"No-no they do but, you just have to wait.",7,15
phoebe,"Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.",7,15
rachel,"All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!",7,15
phoebe,Yeah! you are such a great friend!,7,15

cecilia,How does it happen?,7,15
joey,"Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.",7,15
cecilia,Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!,7,15
joey,"Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.",7,15
ross,...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.,7,15
rachel,I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.,7,15
ross,Do you want to start telling secrets?,7,15

chandler,Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.,7,16
monica,"All right, what about the third guy?",7,16
chandler,You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?,7,16
monica,Can you blame him?,7,16
chandler,"Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, ""I do,"" he's thinking, ""Yeah, I'd do her too!""",7,16
monica,Well then we still have a problem.,7,16
chandler,Yeah!,7,16
phoebe,With what?,7,16

phoebe,Ooh! You should have one of us do it!,7,16
monica,"Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.",7,16
phoebe,No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!,7,16
monica,Are you serious?,7,16
phoebe,Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!,7,16
joey,I call it!!,7,16
phoebe,What?! No! It was my idea!,7,16
chandler,Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.,7,16

chandler,"We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!",7,16
rachel,"Ben you know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. Because I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.",7,16

rachel,"Hey! We were not on a-;Okay. that is fine! Fine. You know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?",7,16
ben,When's my daddy coming back?,7,16
rachel,"Fifty-two minutes.  So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.",7,16
ben,Sharing is good.,7,16
rachel,"Oh, you are one of those. But you know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.",7,16
ben,Really? Like how?,7,16
rachel,"Well you know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.",7,16
ben,that is a good one.,7,16
rachel,Yeah? You like that one?,7,16
ben,"Yeah, you are funny.",7,16
rachel,"I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-;Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right?  And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the centre of their face.",7,16
ben,Can I do it to you?,7,16
rachel,"Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?",7,16
joey,"So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?",7,16
chandler,"No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.",7,16
monica,We're never going to find anybody.,7,16
joey,Well then let me do it!,7,16
chandler,Joe...,7,16
joey,"No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.",7,16
monica,Joey look it's really sweet...,7,16
joey,"No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! You know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!",7,16
monica,That is true.,7,16
joey,"Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, you know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.",7,16
chandler,"You know, we haven't found anybody else.",7,16
monica,It might be kind of cool.,7,16
joey,So I can do it?,7,16
chandler,Yeah you can do it.,7,16
joey,"All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I got to get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?",7,16
chandler,Yeah.,7,16
joey,Okay.,7,16
monica,"Hey Pheebs, how's it going?",7,16
phoebe,"Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!",7,16
monica,"Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?",7,16
phoebe,"Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!",7,16
monica,"Here, take a couple of these.",7,16
phoebe,What is it?,7,16
monica,It's Hexadrin.,7,16
phoebe,"Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here.  Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.",7,16

monica,How about receiving?,7,16
joey,Yes!,7,16
chandler,"See Joe, not that that is not great! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! You know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!",7,16
joey,"Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?",7,16
chandler,"No, not us...  Us!",7,16
monica,"I gotcha. Sorry.  So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?",7,16
phoebe,Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?,7,16
monica,It doesn't say that!,7,16
phoebe,Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!,7,16
chandler,"See Joe, we want you to tell stories but you know, romantic stories. Nice stories.",7,16
joey,"Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! You know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, ""Began their beautiful journey...""",7,16
monica,There you go!,7,16
joey,"""...by doin' it.""",7,16
chandler,Joe?,7,16
joey,"Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing you know you are in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?",7,16
chandler,Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?,7,16
joey,Yeah!! I call that London style.,7,16
monica,"No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.",7,16
joey,Oh.,7,16
monica,"And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...",7,16
joey,Yeah baby!,7,16
chandler,And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.,7,16
joey,Oh.,7,16
chandler,But then later that night...,7,16
joey,Yeah baby!,7,16
chandler,Hey!,7,16
monica,Cute PJ's! you are really living' it up here in London huh?,7,16
chandler,Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9,7,16
monica,Is Joey here?,7,16
chandler,"Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you are not still upset about what that guy told you are you?",7,16
monica,Wouldn't you be?,7,16
chandler,"Well, look it's been a really emotional time you know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!",7,16
monica,Really?,7,16
chandler,You kidding? you are the most beautiful woman in most rooms...   Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?,7,16
monica,"Well, not anymore.",7,16
chandler,But we don't do that.,7,16
monica,"I know, I just thought it would be fun.",7,16
chandler,How drunk are you?,7,16
monica,Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.,7,16
chandler,that is the perfect amount!,7,16
monica,Okay!,7,16
monica,You know what's weird?,7,16
chandler,What?,7,16
monica,This doesn't feel weird!,7,16
chandler,I know.,7,16
monica,you are a really good kisser.,7,16
chandler,"Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you want to get under the covers?",7,16
monica,Hm-hmm!,7,16
chandler,Okay!,7,16
monica,Wow! You are really fast!,7,16
chandler,It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.,7,16

monica,One!,7,16
chandler,Two!,7,16

chandler,Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.,7,16
monica,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!",7,16
chandler,Eh!,7,16
chandler,Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!,7,16

joey,Ah.,7,16
chandler,"Uh, could you leave me one?",7,16
joey,For just you?,7,16

chandler,No I-I-I'm fine.,7,16
joey,"All right, here you go buddy.  Go nuts.",7,16
joey,"that is what that was?!Because that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.",7,16
monica,"Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.",7,16
joey,Oh...  Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was going to?! It's like it was in the stars!,7,16
phoebe,"Yeah, it's totally meant to be.  Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.",7,16
monica,What?!,7,16
chandler,What?,7,16
phoebe,What?!,7,16
chandler,Who did you originally want to hook up with?,7,16
monica,"Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.",7,16
joey,Yeah baby!  No baby!,7,16
chandler,So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?,7,16
monica,No because it-it didn't seem important.,7,16
chandler,"Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him  not me!",7,16
monica,No!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!,7,16
joey,And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receive-;,7,16
chandler,I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.,7,16
monica,"Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!",7,16
joey,"Hey!  Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!",7,16
chandler,Look there is no way you are doing this wedding now. Okay?,7,16
joey,"What?! that is not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?!  I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!",7,16
chandler,"Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.",7,16
monica,"Wait Chandler come on, let's-;it's not a big deal!",7,16
chandler,"It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.",7,16
joey,This is crazy.,7,16
phoebe,I know! Robin is so gay!,7,16
rachel,So now what have we agreed?,7,16
ben,No more pranks.,7,16
rachel,And-and what else?,7,16

rachel,Carol...Lesbian?,7,16
ross,"Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?",7,16
rachel,What line?,7,16
ross,"Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh,  ""Dude, don't you ever was your face?""",7,16
rachel,"All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!",7,16
ross,Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!,7,16

rachel,"Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...",7,16
carol,Oh my God!,7,16
rachel,Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!,7,16
ross,"Uh, you know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!",7,16
rachel,"That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, ""I will be revenged?!""",7,16
ross,"I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?",7,16
rachel,"Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that is what you want!",7,16
ross,"No that is not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...",7,16
rachel,"Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's going to have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!",7,16
ben,Crap!!,7,16
rachel,I got to go!,7,16
joey,Hey.,7,16

joey,"Chandler, come on nothing even happened!",7,16
chandler,"Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...",7,16
joey,"No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.",7,16
chandler,How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!,7,16
joey,"Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! you are so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, Because you guys are perfect for each other. You know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. You know? And you just know it's going to last forever.",7,16
chandler,that is what you should say.,7,16
joey,What?,7,16
chandler,When you are marrying us; that is what you should say.,7,16
joey,Really? I can do it?,7,16
chandler,I'd love it if you would do it.,7,16
joey,Hey!,7,16
chandler,But those are the words! Those exact words!,7,16

ross,Hey!,7,16
rachel,Hey!,7,16
ross,"Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so...",7,16

joey,That sounds fair.,7,17
ross,Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...,7,17
joey,Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're going to have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.,7,17
ross,"Well sorry, that is what I do on dates.",7,17

kristen,Do you two know each other?,7,17

phoebe,Go for it.,7,18
monica,"Phoebe, I'm engaged!",7,18

the cute guy,Hi!,7,18
monica,"Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.",7,18

phoebe,"I did, but that was really fun.",7,18
joey,"And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani!  Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank  my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...",7,18

joey,"Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.",7,18
rachel,"Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. You know when like the cameras are on you and you want to look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. You know? So it's sort of like...",7,18
joey,Hey!,7,18
rachel,You know?,7,18
joey,You practice losing the Grammies too?,7,18
rachel,"Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.",7,18

phoebe,Oh hey!,7,18
monica,Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?,7,18
phoebe,"Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while you know, he'd kind of lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.",7,18
monica,"Okay, stop it Phoebe, you are getting me all tingly.",7,18
phoebe,"All I could think of was you know, ""Is he going to kiss me? Is he going to kiss me?""",7,18
monica,And did he?,7,18
phoebe,"I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.",7,18
monica,"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.",7,18
phoebe,I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.,7,18
monica,"Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never going to have that feeling again am I?",7,18
phoebe,You sound like a guy.,7,18
monica,"No, a guy would be saying, ""I'm never going to get to sleep with anyone else."" Oh my God! I'm never going to get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never going to have a first kiss again.",7,18
phoebe,You'll have a last kiss.,7,18
ross,Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?,7,18
joey,Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?,7,18

rachel,Really?,7,18
ross,"Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?",7,18
rachel,Not right now.,7,18
ross,It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.,7,18
rachel,"Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! You know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.",7,18
ross,Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.,7,18
rachel,Yeah.,7,18

rachel,I didn't. I got under him.,7,18

jake,I miss you already!!,7,18
phoebe,I miss you too!!!!,7,18
monica,"See? that is what I mean. I mean that, that is great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that.

lewis,Professor Geller?,7,18
ross,"Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?",7,18
lewis,"I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kind of hoping you could change my grade.",7,18
ross,And why exactly would I do that?,7,18
lewis,Because I'm in love with you.,7,18
ross,What?!,7,18
lewis,"Yeah, I'm all...in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?",7,18

monica,Have you seen Chandler?,7,18

monica,Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.,7,18

monica,Why?,7,18
phoebe,Because you are marrying him!,7,18
monica,You got to help me out here Pheebs.,7,18
phoebe,"All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.",7,18
monica,So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm going to spend the rest of my life with?,7,18
phoebe,"That is correct! Yes, you are supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.",7,18
monica,Your mother told you this?,7,18
phoebe,Yes!,7,18
monica,The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?,7,18
phoebe,Oh my God! you are right! Go!  Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no!  Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?,7,18

joey,Y-y-yeah!  Yeah you do.,7,18
monica,"Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?",7,18
chandler,"Okay. Well, I think the centrepieces are too big",7,18
monica,you are wrong! The centrepieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?,7,18
chandler,kind of. They're really big.,7,18
monica,Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you are never going to be with anybody new again?,7,18
chandler,What?,7,18
monica,"Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never going to have that feeling. You know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? You know that rush?",7,18
chandler,"No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.",7,18
monica,"Okay, but all right you are a guy, does it not freak you that you are never going to sleep with anybody else?",7,18
chandler,"Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.",7,18
monica,Even with me?,7,18
chandler,"I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.  Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are going to be together for the rest of our lives.",7,18
monica,Really?,7,18
chandler,"Well yeah! But now that I know that you are having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely going to need some kind of sports drink.",7,18
monica,"Come here! Come here!  Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides you know what? I'm going to have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...",7,18
chandler,Water! Water! Water!,7,18
ross,"Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?",7,18
morse,That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?,7,18
ross,"Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you love it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.",7,18
morse,What?! Why?,7,18
ross,Cause I know what you are trying to pull here. Okay? It's not going to work.,7,18
morse,I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.,7,18
ross,"You know what? I-I'm not even going to talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay--Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did!  Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you.

phoebe,Rach?,7,18
rachel,I'll be out in a second.,7,18
phoebe,Oh.  It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honour to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and you know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...,7,18
rachel,"Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8",7,18
phoebe,...in Reservations at 8,7,18
rachel,"Okay honey, you can finish this later we're going to be late. We got to go.",7,18
phoebe,"Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!",7,18
phoebe,Oh hey! How was your audition?,7,19
joey,"I'm sorry, do I know you?",7,19
phoebe,What are you doing?,7,19
joey,"Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm going to be a big movie star!",7,19
phoebe,Oh! You got it?!,7,19
joey,"Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.",7,19
monica,What was it for?,7,19
joey,"Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorsese.",7,19
phoebe,"The next, next?",7,19
joey,"Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorsese, all right? But then this guy's right after him.  Hello!",7,19
estelle,Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!,7,19
joey,They loved me!,7,19
estelle,"Yeah, they want to see you again tomorrow.",7,19
joey,Oh my God!,7,19
estelle,There's just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?,7,19
joey,"Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it!  Oh.  Uh, okay uh let me call you back.",7,19
phoebe,What's the matter?,7,19
joey,They want me to be totally naked in the movie!,7,19
monica,Wow!,7,19
joey,I know! My grandmother's going to see this!,7,19
phoebe,Grandma's going to have to get in line.,7,19
phoebe,Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?,7,19
monica,Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.,7,19
ross,A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.,7,19
monica,"Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?",7,19
phoebe,Sure.,7,19
monica,"I got to make up the guest bedroom.  Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.",7,19
ross,Cassie?,7,19
monica,Uh-hmm.,7,19
ross,"Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.",7,19
monica,"Ross, she's 25 years old.",7,19
ross,So what! I still have-No you are probably right.,7,19
rachel,Hi!,7,19
monica,Hey!,7,19
phoebe,Hey!,7,19
rachel,"Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?",7,19
phoebe,Yeah!,7,19
monica,Subtle guys!,7,19
phoebe,What?!,7,19
monica,I know you are planning my surprise bridal shower.,7,19
rachel,Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!,7,19
monica,Okay. Sorry.,7,19
rachel,Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!,7,19
monica,Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?,7,19
joey,"I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. You know? And the nudity is really important to the story.",7,19
monica,that is what you say about porn.,7,19
joey,you are right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.,7,19
monica,No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!,7,19
joey,Well that is true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.,7,19
monica,"Plus, everyone's going to see your thing.",7,19
phoebe,Well when can we have this shower?,7,19
rachel,She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...,7,19
phoebe,Well that is only two days away. What is the other option?,7,19
rachel,Yesterday!,7,19
phoebe,"Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!",7,19
rachel,"Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!",7,19
phoebe,"Rachel, calm down!",7,19
rachel,"Okay. I'm sorry. you are right, you are right.",7,19
phoebe,Just calm down woman!,7,19
rachel,"Phoebe, I already, I already did.",7,19
phoebe,"Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.",7,19
rachel,"Okay. Okay.  I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we going to have it?",7,19
phoebe,"Uh, here. What time?",7,19
rachel,4 o'clock. Food?,7,19
phoebe,Finger sandwiches and tea.,7,19
rachel,Ooh great! Very Monica.,7,19
phoebe,And chili!,7,19
rachel,"Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?",7,19
phoebe,Both!,7,19
rachel,We're paying for this you know.,7,19
phoebe,Neither.,7,19
rachel,"Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?",7,19
phoebe,Lusts of the flesh.,7,19
rachel,What?,7,19
phoebe,I don't know.  A cowboy theme?,7,19
chandler,Hey!,7,19
monica,Hey!,7,19
chandler,You know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.,7,19
monica,Oh boy me too!,7,19
chandler,You know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...,7,19
monica,Yeah?,7,19
chandler,"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!",7,19
monica,"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!",7,19
chandler,that is me! Come on!,7,19
monica,"Okay.  But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.",7,19
chandler,"Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.",7,19
monica,Shrill?! The wedding is back on!,7,19
cassie,I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.,7,19
chandler,Hi! Nice to meet you!,7,19
cassie,Nice to meet you too.,7,19
monica,"So, are you ready to go?",7,19
cassie,Yeah.,7,19
monica,Chandler!,7,19
chandler,I'll be right with you.,7,19
monica,Cassie needs to stay at your place.,7,19
ross,What-why?,7,19
monica,Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.,7,19
ross,What?! Chandler she's our cousin!,7,19
chandler,I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch.  Say something.,7,19
monica,You were staring about eight inches south of there.,7,19
ross,"Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.",7,19
monica,She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.,7,19
chandler,"Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?",7,19
monica,Wafer thin ice!,7,19
joey,"Hey, I'm back!",7,19
the casting director,Hi-hi Joey.,7,19
joey,"Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?",7,19
the casting director,"Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.",7,19
joey,"Oh great! You know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! You know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!",7,19
the casting director,Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.,7,19
joey,And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?,7,19
the casting director,"Well, the director thinks you are really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.",7,19
joey,Wow! Sure! that is great!,7,19
the casting director,Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.,7,19
joey,"Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.",7,19
the casting director,"Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...",7,19
joey,So...What?,7,19
the casting director,"So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?",7,19
joey,Yes!,7,19
the casting director,Okay.,7,19
joey,No. What?,7,19
the casting director,An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...,7,19
joey,Barmifsaed?,7,19
monica,So to get this part you can't be?,7,19
joey,Nope.,7,19
monica,But you are?,7,19
joey,Yep.,7,19
monica,But you told them you weren't?,7,19
joey,that is right.,7,19
monica,Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with?  What were you thinking?,7,19
joey,"I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell them you can! And just figure out how to do it later.",7,19
monica,Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!,7,19
joey,I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.,7,19
monica,"Oh my God, what are you going to do?!",7,19
joey,I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.,7,19
monica,Unless!,7,19
joey,Unless what?,7,19
monica,"Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.",7,19
joey,Like what?,7,19
monica,"Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.",7,19
phoebe,"Hey! I've got a great idea for party favours for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.",7,19
rachel,"Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.",7,19
phoebe,"Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that is coming? Me. Are you?",7,19
monica,Hey!,7,19
phoebe,Hey!,7,19
rachel,Hey! What's up Mon?,7,19
monica,"Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?",7,19
rachel,Have at it.,7,19
monica,"Okay.  All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese?  That won't work. Olive loaf?  I hope that won't work.",7,19
rachel,Are you making' him a sandwich?,7,19
monica,"No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm going to go guys.",7,19
phoebe and rachel,Okay.,7,19
monica,I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!,7,19
rachel,We have to get her a present?!,7,19
phoebe,Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book!  We have a guest list!,7,19
rachel,Oh my God you are amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?,7,19
phoebe,"Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.",7,19
ross,Cassie?!,7,19
cassie,Hey Ross!,7,19
ross,Hey!,7,19
cassie,"It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.",7,19
ross,"Oh. Oh, that is right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.",7,19
cassie,"Ah yeah, sorry about that.",7,19
ross,"It's okay. Come, come on in.",7,19
cassie,"Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.",7,19
ross,Oh.,7,19
cassie,Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!,7,19
ross,Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.,7,19
cassie,"Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.",7,19
ross,Yeah-No!!,7,19
ross,"Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that...hot dog.",7,19
cassie,I'm all done.,7,19
ross,Thank God.,7,19
cassie,I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.,7,19
ross,"Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried?  We're probably too old to do that now.",7,19
cassie,"I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.",7,19
ross,Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that is when I realized that we are related.,7,19
cassie,"It took you that long to figure it out, huh?",7,19
ross,"Well I'm, I'm a little slow.  Just as our children would be.",7,19
phoebe,Hi!,7,19
woman,Hi!,7,19
phoebe,"How are you?  Good.  Hi, thanks for coming.",7,19
woman,Oh thank you.,7,19
phoebe,"Thank you.  No?  All right.  Oh, it's so nice to see you.",7,19
woman,No.,7,19
the other woman,No thanks.,7,19
phoebe,Okay.  Hey Rach?,7,19
rachel,Yeah?,7,19
phoebe,Who the hell are all these people?,7,19
rachel,"Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.",7,19
phoebe,"Hmm, you know there's another word for people like that. Losers!",7,19
rachel,Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honour. How do you know Monica?,7,19
woman,I was her accountant four years ago.,7,19
rachel,oh!,7,19
woman,I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.,7,19
rachel,that is great!,7,19
woman,"So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?",7,19
phoebe and rachel,I don't know.,7,19
rachel,Excuse us for a minute.  You didn't tell her to come?!,7,19
phoebe,You were supposed to tell her!,7,19
rachel,No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!,7,19
phoebe,"Fine, I'll go call her.",7,19
rachel,Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!,7,19
monica,"Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.",7,19
joey,Wow! This looks great!,7,19
monica,"Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.  Umm, this one is made of bologna.",7,19
joey,And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?,7,19
monica,"Oh, just until the glue dries.",7,19
joey,Thank God!,7,19
monica,"Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.",7,19
joey,Ah.,7,19
monica,"Okay?  Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's going to shrink.",7,19
joey,Well maybe we just take that one away.,7,19
monica,"I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that is really just for me.  Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's going to work.",7,19
joey,"Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.",7,19
joey,Ow!,7,19
monica,Toothpick?,7,19
joey,Yeah.,7,19
monica,What are you trying on now?,7,19
joey,The fruit roll up.,7,19
monica,And?,7,19
joey,Delicious.,7,19
monica,Joey!,7,19
joey,Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!,7,19
monica,What?! Which one?!,7,19
joey,The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!,7,19
ross,"She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick!  Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever.  Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.",7,19
cassie,Hey! What the hell are you doing?!,7,19
ross,"Say something clever!  Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words.  Any words will do.  Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever!  There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!!   I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time.   Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.",7,19
monica,Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.,7,19
rachel,"Oh Monica, we are so sorry.",7,19
monica,For what?,7,19
rachel,"Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.",7,19
phoebe,And then for forgetting to invite you to it.,7,19
monica,You al-you already had it?,7,19
phoebe,"Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.",7,19
rachel,"Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.",7,19
phoebe,We ruined everything.,7,19
rachel,Ugh...,7,19
monica,"Well no wait a minute that is not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kind of works out for the best.",7,19
rachel,"What do you, what do you mean?",7,19
monica,"Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I don't even like!",7,19
rachel,Surprise...,7,19
phoebe,Sur-surprise.,7,19
rachel,...Monica.,7,19
joey,"And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?",7,19
the director,Yeah.,7,19

chandler,You mean like for award shows?,7,20
rachel,Some of them.,7,20
chandler,"You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, ""You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!""",7,20

rachel,It's a pretty cool tux.,7,20
chandler,"Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill.  Would Monica let me wear this?",7,20
joey,We should really learn how to play the real way.,7,20

rachel,"Well, what are you going to wear?",7,20
joey,"Multi-coloured robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.",7,20
rachel,Huh. Does Monica know about this?,7,20
joey,I don't think so.,7,20
rachel,Can I please be there when you tell her?,7,20
phoebe,"Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?",7,20
rachel,"OH, you know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.",7,20
joey,Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.,7,20
phoebe,What is this? What's going on?,7,20
joey,Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!,7,20
rachel,"Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?",7,20
phoebe,Joey's!,7,20

rachel,"Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I you know...kissed a little bit.",7,20
phoebe,"Yeah, I'm sure that happened.",7,20
rachel,It-it did!,7,20
phoebe,Sure!,7,20
joey,Hey.  It happened!,7,20
rachel,"Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!",7,20
phoebe,Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.,7,20
joey,Why are you taking this away from me?,7,20
rachel,"Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!",7,20
phoebe,Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.,7,20
rachel,I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!,7,20
phoebe,"Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you are so-You know so...vanilla.",7,20
rachel,Vanilla?!,7,20
phoebe,Yeah.,7,20
rachel,I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!,7,20
phoebe,To Ross.,7,20
rachel,"All right, you know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.",7,20
phoebe,Okay! All right! Yeah! Because I just can't picture it.,7,20
joey,"Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.",7,20
ross,Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!,7,20
chandler,A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?,7,20
ross,"No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!",7,20
chandler,What?,7,20
ross,that is right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.,7,20
chandler,You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!,7,20
ross,So?,7,20
chandler,So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.,7,20
ross,"Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.",7,20
chandler,"Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!",7,20
ross,"Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.",7,20
chandler,"Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.",7,20
ross,When I got married you slept with my sister.,7,20
chandler,That was pretty 007.,7,20
joey,Hey.,7,20
monica,"Hey. Oh good-good you are here! All right, I figured it out. I'm going to take two tables of eight, I'm going to add your parents, and I'm going to turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!",7,20
joey,"Yeah, they're not coming.",7,20
monica,What?!,7,20
joey,Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.,7,20
monica,"Oh that is too bad. It's true, but too bad.",7,20
joey,"Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...",7,20
monica,Oh Joey!,7,20
joey,"Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.",7,20
monica,No she hasn't.,7,20
joey,Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?,7,20
monica,"Well, what am I going to say?",7,20
joey,"I don't know. Just uh, just tell them it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...",7,20
monica,"Hello?  Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani?  Hi, this is Monica Geller.  Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office!   T-Tell me about it!  Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office!  What are they Irish?!",7,20
melissa,"...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well.  And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.",7,20
rachel,"Oh. Oh, that is great!",7,20
melissa,"Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?",7,20
phoebe,"Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.",7,20
melissa,What one?,7,20
phoebe,"Yeah! you know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Phalange died of alcohol poisoning.",7,20
melissa,"Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?",7,20
rachel,"Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, telling' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.",7,20
melissa,What?,7,20
rachel,"Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...",7,20
melissa,Yeah?,7,20
rachel,...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.,7,20
melissa,"Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you are talking about.",7,20
phoebe,Really?!,7,20
chandler,Ross is Batman!,7,20
monica,"Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.",7,20
chandler,Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!,7,20
monica,What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!,7,20
chandler,Batman has a utility belt!,7,20
monica,007 has a fancy car!,7,20
chandler,Batman has the Batmobile!,7,20

monica,Have you ever been to one of my weddings?,7,20
joey,"Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. Because my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!",7,20
monica,The wedding starts at six.,7,20
joey,"Okay. Okay, I totally hear you. Ooh how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?",7,20
monica,You'll vamp?!,7,20
joey,"Yeah! Yeah you know, like warm up the crowd. Ask them where they're from. Because in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer!  There is no one better! There is no one greater!",7,20
rachel,How can you not remember us kissing?!,7,20
melissa,I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.,7,20
rachel,Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knocking' together?,7,20
phoebe,"Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.",7,20
rachel,"Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.",7,20
melissa,I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.,7,20
rachel,No!!,7,20
phoebe,"Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.",7,20
rachel,Thank you Phoebe.,7,20
melissa,She didn't.,7,20
phoebe,I know.,7,20
ross,Hey!,7,20
monica,You just carry that around?,7,20
ross,Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.,7,20
monica,Between you and...,7,20
ross,Gunther.  Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? You know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.,7,20
chandler,I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.,7,20
monica,A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.,7,20
ross,Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.,7,20
chandler,"Well, does that mean that you are not going to wearing yours?",7,20
ross,What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!,7,20
chandler,Let me try it on!,7,20
ross,"Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not getting' in there.",7,20
chandler,Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman!  What's this?,7,20
ross,What?,7,20
chandler,An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!,7,20
ross,Let me see that!  Oh man!,7,20
chandler,The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.,7,20
joey,"Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?",7,20
monica,"All right that is it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You want to sing a song? You want to do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!",7,20
joey,"No! No, I-I just want to thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.",7,20
monica,Oh.,7,20
chandler,"Well, you are welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.",7,20
joey,"Okay. I will. OH! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!  Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this  is for party time.",7,20
rachel,It happened! I am telling you it happened!,7,20
melissa,"Okay.  Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you  because umm, you know you've gotten weird.  Take care you guys.",7,20
rachel,"What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute!  Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not going to let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!",7,20
melissa,My God! You love me!,7,20
rachel,What?,7,20
melissa,"Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knocking' together I...  I just didn't want to tell you Because I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have...",7,20
rachel,Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!,7,20

rachel,I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!,7,20
melissa,Shut up!,7,20
rachel,I'm sorry!,7,20
melissa,"Oh you don't have to be  sorry. I'm...I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you.  I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't...picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I got to go. Eh...kiss good-bye?  No? Okay.",7,20
rachel,Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was going to...,7,20

rachel,And?,7,20
phoebe,I've had better.,7,20

chandler,Whose is it?,7,20
rachel,Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.,7,20
chandler,Whose is it?,7,20
rachel,I don't want to say.,7,20
chandler,"Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?",7,20
rachel,Diane Keeton.,7,20
monica,Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!,7,21
chandler,Do you realize you get louder each week?,7,21
monica,There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?,7,21
chandler,"I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.",7,21
monica,"Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humour when it comes to the wedding.",7,21
chandler,"Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?",7,21
monica,No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.,7,21
chandler,Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?,7,21
monica,Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.,7,21
chandler,"Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.",7,21
chandler,"Monica, there are no words...  There are no words! This should not be this hard!",7,21
joey,"All right, uh...  Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?",7,21
ross,"Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.",7,21
chandler,"I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!",7,21
rachel,Monica what?,7,21
phoebe,What?!,7,21
rachel,What is the emergency?!,7,21
monica,You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!,7,21
rachel,"Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.",7,21
monica,Thank you.,7,21
phoebe,"Yeah, except your breasts look kind of small.",7,21
monica,Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.,7,21
phoebe,Oh! Yeah!,7,21
ross,"Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.",7,21
chandler,"Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.",7,21
ross,"...everyone, this is Chandler!",7,21
fat monica,"Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.",7,21
chandler,Okay.,7,21
rachel,"Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, ""Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.""",7,21
chandler,"All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?",7,21
monica,Ennnh.,7,21
monica,"Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!",7,21
phoebe,Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about you know all the things that he's taught you. Like...  Or all the things you taught him.,7,21
monica,"Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.  You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!",7,21
chandler,There are seven?!  that is one?,7,21
monica,It's kind of an important one!,7,21
chandler,"OH, you know-You know what, I was looking at it upside down.",7,21
rachel,"Well, you know, sometimes that helps.",7,21
monica,"All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,  2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!",7,21

joey,"""...when I look back over our time together...""",7,21
chandler,Yeah?,7,21
joey,"Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.",7,21

chandler,You'll get one.,7,21
monica,Oh yeah? When?,7,21
chandler,"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?",7,21
monica,Why won't I be married when I'm 40?,7,21
chandler,"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.",7,21
monica,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?",7,21
chandler,"No, no, no.",7,21
monica,What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?,7,21
chandler,"Uh, uh.",7,21
monica,Well?,7,21
chandler,Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!,7,21
ross,"I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!",7,21
monica,Do you think he knew I was here?,7,21
chandler,Nice try.,7,21
monica,"Wait, wait, wait!",7,21
chandler,"Look, Monica...",7,21
monica,Look!,7,21
chandler,This is not going to work.,7,21
monica,I bet this will work!,7,21
chandler,You are so great! I love you!,7,21
monica,What?,7,21
chandler,"Nothing! I said, I said ""you are so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!",7,21
monica,You said you loved me! I can't believe this!,7,21
chandler,No I didn't!,7,21
monica,"Yes, you did!",7,21
chandler,No I didn't!,7,21
monica,You love me!,7,21
chandler,No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!,7,21
chandler,"You know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?",7,21
monica,Then all your stuff would be here.,7,21
chandler,"Well, what if all my stuff was here?",7,21
monica,"Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.",7,21
chandler,Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?,7,21
monica,You wanted it to be a surprise.,7,21
chandler,Oh my God.,7,21
monica,Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky.  As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!,7,21
chandler,"Okay!  Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought...  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me?",7,21
monica,Yes.,7,21
joey,Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!,7,21
monica,Come in! Come in!  We're engaged!!!,7,21

ross,Hey!,7,21
rachel,Hey!,7,21
phoebe,Hey!,7,21
rachel,"Hey, what have you guys been up to?",7,21
ross,"Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.",7,21
joey,"How is ""Monica, I love your sweet ass,"" inappropriate?",7,21
ross,How's Monica coming along with her vows?,7,21
phoebe,"Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, Because she's not so good at the writing.",7,21
ross,I can't believe in four weeks they're going to be married!,7,21
phoebe,Well let's just hope it works. You know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?,7,21
ross,Phoebe that is not true.,7,21
phoebe,"Yeah, you are right. How's the Mrs.?",7,21
rachel,I can't believe they've been together for three years.,7,21
joey,Has it been that long?!,7,21
ross,"Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.",7,21
joey,"Hey, it's me! I'm coming' in!",7,21
chandler,"I've had a very long, hard day.",7,21
joey,"Ahh, I'm going to go get some chicken. Want some?",7,21
chandler,"Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.",7,21
joey,Okay.,7,21
chandler,"Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.",7,21
monica,Chicken? I could eat some chicken.,7,21
chandler,Hey Joe!,7,21
chandler,"Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.",7,21
rachel,I don't know why they didn't just tell us.,7,21
joey,I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.,7,21
joey,You?!  And-and you?!,7,21
monica,"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!",7,21
joey,How?! When?!,7,21
chandler,It happened in London.,7,21
joey,IN LONDON!!!,7,21
chandler,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.,7,21
joey,But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!,7,21
chandler,No-no-no-no-no! You can't!,7,21
monica,"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.",7,21
joey,"All right! Man, this is unbelievable!",7,21
monica,I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm going to be doing laundry for a couple of hours.,7,21
chandler,Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?,7,21
monica,"Aww, you know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...",7,21
rachel,Argh!!,7,21
phoebe,"Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler!  Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!  OH!! OH! Ahh-ah!!",7,21

phoebe,YOU KNOW?!!!,7,21
rachel,"Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!",7,21
ross,What's going on?,7,21
phoebe and rachel,oh!!!,7,21
rachel,HI!! Hi!,7,21
ross,What?! What?!,7,21
rachel,"Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!",7,21
ross,"Actually, it looks really good.",7,21
phoebe,Get in here!!!,7,21
phoebe,"Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?",7,21
joey,"Yes, but you know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!",7,21
phoebe,"Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own",7,21
rachel,"All right honey, we'd better go if we want to catch that movie.",7,21
monica,Bye!,7,21
all,Bye!,7,21
phoebe,Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.,7,21
chandler,"Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!",7,21
monica,"Actually, I did!",7,21
chandler,"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?",7,21
monica,"oh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!",7,21
chandler,Phoebe knows about us!,7,21
joey,Well I didn't tell them!,7,21
monica,Them?! Who's them?,7,21
joey,"Uhh, Phoebe and Joey.",7,21
monica,Joey!,7,21
joey,And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!,7,21
monica,"Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...",7,21
chandler,"Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!",7,21
phoebe,"I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye!  Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!",7,21
rachel,Are you kidding?!,7,21
phoebe,No!,7,21
rachel,"I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa!  Joey, do they know that we know?",7,21
joey,No.,7,21
rachel,Joey!,7,21
joey,They know you know.,7,21
rachel,"Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!",7,21
phoebe,"God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know!  Joey, you can't say anything!",7,21
joey,I couldn't even if I wanted too.,7,21
chandler,"Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!",7,21
monica,She's bluffing!,7,21
chandler,"Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!",7,21
phoebe,He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.,7,21
joey,Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!,7,21
rachel,"Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.",7,21
joey,Ooh!,7,21
rachel,Okay!,7,21
joey,"I like that!  Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work them!",7,21
phoebe,"Joey!  Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.",7,21
joey,It's not my first time.,7,21
monica,You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!,7,21
chandler,"Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?",7,21
monica,Of course.,7,21
chandler,"Oh, you are-you are going?",7,21
phoebe,"Umm, not without you, lover.  So, this is my bra.",7,21
chandler,"It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were going to have all the sex.",7,21

chandler,"Love her! that is right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!!  I love you, Monica.",7,21
monica,I love you too Chandler.,7,21
phoebe,"I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!",7,21
joey,So that is it! It's over! Everybody knows!,7,21
monica,"Well actually, Ross doesn't.",7,21
chandler,"Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.",7,21
ross,No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!!  GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,7,21
phoebe,"You know, you are friend's getting married, it's got to change things.",7,21
rachel,You really think it would be that different?,7,21
phoebe,"How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're going to be having kids, and then they're just going to be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're going to have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.",7,21
rachel,"Well, things change.",7,21
joey,I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!,7,21
ross,It'll be okay Joe.,7,21
joey,"I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are.",7,21
rachel,"Hey, who's this little naked guy?",7,21
ross,That little naked guy would be me.,7,21

ross,You can't do that!,7,21
joey,If he goes first he can!,7,21
ross,Hey!,7,22
monica,Hey!,7,22
ross,"Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.",7,22
rachel,"Wait a minute!  You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you are the only one who's allowed to drive it.",7,22
monica,"Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.",7,22
ross,It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!,7,22
monica,Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you are done.,7,22
joey,Hey!,7,22
ross,Hey!,7,22
phoebe,Hey!,7,22
joey,"Saw the Porsche out there Mon, looking' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?",7,22
rachel,You let Joey drive it?!,7,22
phoebe,"I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.",7,22
monica,"Nice work everybody! So much for the you know, ""You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel"" plan!",7,22
rachel,Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.,7,22
phoebe,"Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.",7,22
monica,"Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you are a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.",7,22
ross,Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.,7,22
joey,"Yeah, you got a couple hours?",7,22
ross,Whew! That was a brisk ride!,7,22
rachel,Take the top down did you?,7,22
ross,Only way to fly.,7,22
rachel,Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!,7,22
ross,you are fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.,7,22
rachel,"Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.",7,22
ross,Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.,7,22
rachel,I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.,7,22
ross,What?!  Give-give me a brush.,7,22
rachel,give me the keys!,7,22
ross,No way!,7,22
rachel,Well no brush!,7,22
ross,"Fine! You know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.",7,22
rachel,Alimony.,7,22
monica,"Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.",7,22
chandler,"Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that is because I didn't send him an invitation.",7,22
monica,Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.,7,22
chandler,I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.,7,22
monica,Well what are you going to do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!,7,22
chandler,"Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.",7,22
phoebe,"Ooh, I think I want to trade circles.",7,22
chandler,"Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is going to be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.",7,22
monica,So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.,7,22
phoebe,"Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.",7,22
rachel,"Ah!  Ooh, nice!",7,22
rachel,My God!,7,22
ross,What do you think you are doing?!,7,22
rachel,Just washing the windshield.,7,22
ross,There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?,7,22
rachel,Oh.,7,22
ross,No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car!  Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!,7,22
rachel,"Look Ross, if you are so freaked out, just get in the car!",7,22
ross,With you?! Yeah right!,7,22
rachel,All right.,7,22
ross,Okay! Okay! Okay!,7,22
rachel,What are you doing?! Get in the front!,7,22
ross,In the death seat?!!,7,22
rachel,Oh my...,7,22
man,Hey guys!,7,22
joey,Hey!,7,22
phoebe,Hey sweetie!,7,22
man,Ready to go?,7,22
phoebe,"Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.",7,22
man,Wait a minute!,7,22
phoebe,What?  Oh.  Ooh.  Whoa! That one kept going.,7,22
joey,So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?,7,22
man,Over a month.,7,22
joey,"Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.",7,22
man,"Sure, I'd like that.",7,22
joey,"So uh, what's your name?",7,22
man,Its Jake.,7,22
joey,"Joey.  Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?",7,22
jake,"Yeah, big fan.",7,22
joey,Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you want to go?,7,22
jake,Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.,7,22
monica,Here!,7,22
chandler,What's this?,7,22
monica,It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.,7,22
chandler,Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!!  We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?,7,22
monica,"We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.",7,22
chandler,You know we already went over this and I won!,7,22
monica,"No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you are marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.",7,22
chandler,Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't want to.,7,22
monica,"Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...",7,22
chandler,"No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. You know it's hard enough to be fourteen. you are skinny. you are wearing Speedos-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!",7,22
monica,"Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? that is a, that is a pretty great dad.",7,22
chandler,He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!,7,22
monica,Who's Mr. Girabaldi?,7,22
chandler,Does it matter?!,7,22
monica,"Chandler, you are not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you are going to regret it for the rest of your life.",7,22
chandler,"Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.",7,22
monica,Yes!,7,22
chandler,So I really never get to win anymore?,7,22
monica,How much did ever really win before?,7,22
joey,Pheebs!,7,22
phoebe,Hey!,7,22
joey,"Listen, you know how uh, when you are wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?",7,22
phoebe,Yeah!,7,22
joey,"Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!",7,22
phoebe,I know. They were mine.,7,22
joey,"Oh.  No! No wait, that is weird!",7,22
phoebe,"No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.",7,22
joey,that is weird!,7,22
phoebe,I'm wearing his briefs right now.,7,22
joey,that is...kind of hot.,7,22
phoebe,I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.,7,22
joey,"Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.",7,22
phoebe,And! You know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.,7,22
joey,"Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!",7,22
phoebe,There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.,7,22
joey,"Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.",7,22
phoebe,I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.,7,22
joey,Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.,7,22
phoebe,Okay whatever.,7,22
joey,You've seen my huge stack of porn right?,7,22
rachel,God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.,7,22
ross,You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!,7,22
rachel,Oh Ross you are so tense! You just got to relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...,7,22
ross,What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that is not funny! Just stop horsing around!,7,22
rachel,I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.,7,22
rachel,Uh-oh.,7,22
ross,"Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.",7,22
rachel,Really? You think so?,7,22
ross,I was talking to myself! you are going down!,7,22
a waiter in drag,Has someone taken your order yet?,7,22
monica,"Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did.  She?  I'm-I'm sorry I'm new. I don't...",7,22
waiter in drag,Hm-mmm?,7,22
chandler,"Yeah, I just ordered a beer!",7,22
waiter in drag,you are straight. I get it.,7,22
monica,I still say that if we had called your dad we could have gotten better seats.,7,22
chandler,No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not going to be too happy to see me either.,7,22
monica,Why not?!,7,22
chandler,"I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kind of tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years",7,22
monica,What?!,7,22
chandler,"Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. You know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it.  Here we go.",7,22
announcer,Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!,7,22
helena,Hello darlings.,7,22
chandler,And there's daddy!,7,22
rachel,"Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!",7,22
ross,"Yeah, I'll get right on that.",7,22
rachel,Oh come on Ross!!,7,22
ross,"No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.",7,22
rachel,"Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?",7,22

rachel,I know. I know. Oh God.  There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?,7,23
phoebe,"Yeah.  Oh, that is gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!",7,23
rachel,Oh!,7,23
phoebe,No-no! I-I...I found one.,7,23
rachel,Okay.,7,23
rachel,Oh thank you!  Oh God!  Can I have another one?,7,23
phoebe,Sure.  Do you need some floss?,7,23
rachel,Oh God I just can not imagine what is going to happen if Chandler doesn't show up!,7,23
phoebe,Oh here's a whole bunch.,7,23
rachel,"Oh, I mean she's going to be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, ""Oh that poor girl. ""you know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.",7,23
phoebe,Oh my God!,7,23
rachel,What?,7,23
phoebe,"There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant.  So I guess she won't be totally alone.",7,23
rachel,Oh my God!,7,23
phoebe,"I know! Monica's going to have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?",7,23
rachel,Oh my God!,7,23
phoebe,"Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?",7,23
rachel,"No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.",7,23
phoebe,"Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.",7,23
rachel,"Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.",7,23
phoebe,Right.,7,23
rachel,Okay?,7,23
phoebe,"Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?",7,23
rachel,No. Why?,7,23
phoebe,"Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.",7,23
rachel,Anything?,7,23
ross,"No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!",7,23
phoebe,You told them he was missing?,7,23
ross,"No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.",7,23
rachel,"All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.",7,23
ross,No! Hey! Hey! We can't!,7,23
rachel,"Ross, she's going to start getting ready soon!",7,23
ross,"Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.",7,23
rachel,"All right, well how much time do you need?",7,23
ross,Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?,7,23
rachel,One hour.,7,23
ross,Give me two.,7,23
rachel,Then why do you ask?!,7,23
ross,"Okay, wish me luck.",7,23
phoebe,Okay. I'm going with you.,7,23
ross,Why?!,7,23
phoebe,"Ross, you are tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.",7,23
rachel,"All right, I'll see you guys later.",7,23
phoebe,"Okay. Wait, do you know how you are going to stall her?",7,23
rachel,I'll figure something out.,7,23
phoebe,All right. Good luck.,7,23
rachel,Thanks.,7,23
monica,"Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.",7,23
rachel,"Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.",7,23
monica,About what?,7,23
rachel,Umm... I'm never going to getting married!,7,23
monica,"Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?",7,23
rachel,"No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.",7,23
monica,Any woman would be lucky to have you.,7,23
rachel,Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.,7,23
monica,Rachel! You okay?,7,23
joey,"Excuse me, Aaron?  Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.",7,23
the director,"Joey, you got to stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.",7,23
joey,I'm having surgery!,7,23
the director,What?!,7,23
joey,"Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.",7,23
the director,What kind of surgery?!,7,23
joey,Transplant.,7,23
the director,But you are supposed to work on Monday.,7,23
joey,Hair transplant.,7,23
the director,But you are not bald.,7,23
joey,It's not on my head.,7,23
the director,"Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you are probably going to be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine.  Morning Richard.",7,23
joey,"Hey! you are here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!",7,23
richard,I'm wearing two belts.,7,23
joey,Are you drunk?,7,23
richard,No!,7,23
joey,Yes you are!,7,23
richard,All right.,7,23
ross,We are never going to find him! He's one guy in a huge city!,7,23
phoebe,Oh my God! Is that him?,7,23
ross,"That is an old, Chinese woman!",7,23
phoebe,"He could be in disguise, you know.",7,23
ross,"Aww, you know...You know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you are Chandler and-and you want to hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?",7,23
ross,So this is your office?,7,23
chandler,How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!,7,23
phoebe,What the hell are you doing?!,7,23
chandler,Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?,7,23
ross,"She's fine. She doesn't know you are gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.",7,23
chandler,No! No! No! I can't do that!,7,23
phoebe,Why not?!,7,23
chandler,"Because if I go home, we're going to become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!",7,23
ross,What's wrong with being the Bings?,7,23
chandler,The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!,7,23
ross,"Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?",7,23
chandler,No.,7,23
ross,Then you are neither of your parents!,7,23
chandler,"It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.",7,23
phoebe,"But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.",7,23
chandler,"I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.",7,23
ross,"You know, okay. you are right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?",7,23
chandler,"Well yeah, but then...",7,23
ross,"Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just going to go home and take a shower. Now, that is not scary right?",7,23
chandler,Depends on what you mean by we.,7,23
rachel,The nights are the hardest.  But then the day comes! And that is every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...,7,23
monica,"The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!",7,23
rachel,I know. At dusk. that is such a hard time for me.,7,23
monica,"I'm going to go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!",7,23
rachel,Okay. But wait!,7,23
monica,What?!,7,23
rachel,Let's go to lunch.,7,23
monica,I can't go to lunch!!,7,23
rachel,Right.,7,23
rachel,Oh good God! I've fallen down!,7,23
monica,What's going on?,7,23
rachel,"Okay. All right.  Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.",7,23
monica,"Okay, you are-you are really freaking me out.",7,23
rachel,We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.,7,23
monica,"How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!",7,23
phoebe,"Found the vest! I mean we're going to have to keep an eye on it, you know make sure we don't lose it again...",7,23
rachel,Oh!,7,23
monica,"Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, ""Oh my God! The worst has happened!""",7,23
joey,I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!,7,23
richard,That can be arranged.,7,23
the director,Let's reset.,7,23
joey,What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!,7,23
the director,Let's take it from there.,7,23
richard,Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.,7,23
joey,"Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?",7,23
richard,Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!,7,23
joey,Thank you. Thank you.,7,23
the director,"Still rolling, and action!",7,23
joey,I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!,7,23
richard,"Now, that can be arranged!  Slippery little bugger!",7,23
phoebe,So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?,7,23
mrs. geller,Here comes the bride.,7,23
phoebe,Oh my God Monica!,7,23
monica,I want to wear this everyday.,7,23
rachel,You look so beautiful.,7,23
monica,I'm so happy for me.,7,23
rachel,Hello?,7,23
joey,Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?,7,23
rachel,"Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.",7,23
joey,Damnit!,7,23
rachel,What? Why? Where are you?,7,23
joey,I'm still on the set!,7,23
rachel,Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!,7,23
joey,"I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.",7,23
rachel,Oh my God! I'm going to have to find another minister.,7,23
joey,"No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put them both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.",7,23
rachel,"Ugh! Joey, I have to go.",7,23
joey,Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!,7,23
ross,"There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?",7,23
chandler,No.,7,23
ross,"I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.",7,23
chandler,"Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?",7,23
ross,"Getting married.  Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!",7,23
chandler,Yeah. you are right. Hey I-I can do that.,7,23
ross,Yeah.,7,23
chandler,"Okay, excuse me for a minute.",7,23
ross,"Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!",7,23
chandler,"Ross, I am not going to run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.",7,23
ross,Okay.,7,23
chandler,Okay.,7,23
chandler,Oh fresh air!,7,23
phoebe,"Wait! Maybe, maybe you are overreacting! You do that you know.",7,23
rachel,"Well Phoebe, we got to do something!  Well, you know. I mean there's no way Joey's going to make it in time. So I'm going to through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.",7,23
phoebe,"Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.",7,23
rachel,Okay.,7,23
phoebe,Okay.,7,23
rachel,"Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations.  Mazel Tov!  Hi! Oh, great hat.  Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?",7,23
the rabbi,I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?,7,23
rachel,"Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopoulos and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.",7,23
ross,"Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?",7,23
mr. geller,I thought he was with you.,7,23
ross,"He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, you know? Hide and seek.",7,23
mr. geller,"You can't ask us son, that is cheating.",7,23
ross,"you are right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.",7,23
mrs. geller,"Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.",7,23
mrs. bing,"As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.",7,23
mr. bing,"But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.",7,23
mrs. bing,"Honey, it isn't good luck.",7,23
ross,Oh my God! Monica!,7,23

phoebe,Yeah!,7,23
phoebe,What's going on?,7,23

joey,Aaron! You got to let me go. The guy's hammered!,7,23
the director,"I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.",7,23
richard,You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?,7,23
joey,"So I uh, I just talked to the director. that is it, we're done for the day.",7,23
richard,Well have we finished the scene?,7,23

chandler,Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...,7,23
phoebe and ross,Cigarettes?!!,7,23
chandler,"Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that is when I uh, saw this. Yeah, you know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.",7,23
phoebe,Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.,7,23
chandler,"But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.",7,23
ross,Dude.,7,23
mr. geller,Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!,7,23
mr. bing,Our little boy is getting married.,7,23

phoebe,What?,7,23
ross,I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.,7,23
mrs. geller,Oh I wish you are grandmother had lived to see this.,7,23
monica,She's right there.,7,23
mrs. geller,"Not that old crow, my mother.  Congratulations darling.",7,23
mr. geller,I love you sweetheart.,7,23
chandler,You look beautiful. Is this new?,7,23
monica,Not now.,7,23
chandler,Okay.,7,23
monica,Who is this?,7,23
the rabbi,I am Father Kalebasous.,7,23
chandler,He's Greek Orthodox.,7,23
rachel,As are you...,7,23
the rabbi,Let us begin. Dearly beloved...,7,23
joey,"that is my line!  I can take it from here, thanks.  Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now,  but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh?  We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?",7,23
monica,He took off?,7,23
rachel,Go on! Go on.,7,23
monica,"Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!",7,23
joey,Chandler?,7,23
chandler,"No, that is okay.  Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever going to had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You want to know if I'm sure?",7,23
joey,"You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?",7,23
chandler,I do.,7,23
monica,I do.,7,23
joey,Yeah you do!,7,23
ross,Rings?,7,23
joey,Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.,7,23
joey,"We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife.  Now kiss her again.",7,23
chandler,I love you. And I know about the baby.,7,23
monica,What baby?,7,23
chandler,Our baby.,7,23
monica,We have a baby?,7,23
chandler,Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.,7,23
monica,I didn't take a pregnancy test.,7,23
chandler,Then...who did?,7,23
phoebe,Oh and they're going to have a baby.,7,23
rachel,Uh-huh.,7,23
photographer,Great.  Great! Just give me a sec to change film.,8,1
monica,Okay.,8,1
ross,"Okay, I know I'm not supposed to know, but I do. And I'm so excited for you!",8,1
joey,What? What's going on?,8,1
ross,Monica's pregnant!,8,1
joey,Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!,8,1
monica,Guys! I'm not pregnant.,8,1
joey,Ah.  Slow swimmers?,8,1
ross,What?! What do you mean? You-you-you are not pregnant?,8,1
monica,You didn't tell anybody I was did you?!,8,1
ross,No!  I'll be right back.,8,1
photographer,Now why don't we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.,8,1
monica,"Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.",8,1
joey,I can't! I-I don't have any other clothes here.,8,1
monica,Find some! Please! Anything that doesn't say I-I died tragically in France.,8,1
photographer,Well then why don't we see the bride and the groom and the bridesmaids.,8,1
phoebe,"Okay.  Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren't pregnant?",8,1
monica,Because I'm not.,8,1
phoebe,"We found your test in the trash, if you are not pregnant--It's because I am.",8,1
chandler,What?! What are you talking about?,8,1
monica,What are you talking about?,8,1
phoebe,"Yes, I-I am with child.  And I didn't want to say anything because it's your day; I didn't want to steal your thunder.",8,1
monica,Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?!  Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!,8,1
chandler,Who's the father?,8,1
monica,Yeah!,8,1
phoebe,I can't say.,8,1
monica,Why?!,8,1
chandler,Why not?,8,1
phoebe,I can't say because he's famous.,8,1
rachel,"Oh my God, who is it?!",8,1
monica,"Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.",8,1
phoebe,"Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.",8,1
chandler,As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?,8,1
phoebe,What?! Well he never said that to me!,8,1
photographer,Why don't we have Monica step away and we'll get Chandler and the bridesmaids.,8,1
phoebe,How about just the bridesmaids?,8,1
chandler,You know I am the groom right? I was told it was kind of big deal.,8,1
phoebe,It is.,8,1
rachel,For you.,8,1
phoebe,Oh my God!,8,1
rachel,"Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet.",8,1
phoebe,So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.,8,1
rachel,"You said that she was, I just didn't disagree with you.",8,1
phoebe,Sneaky.,8,1
rachel,Oh yeah.,8,1
photographer,Smile ladies.,8,1
rachel,Oh!  Oh by the way?,8,1
phoebe,Uh-hmm.,8,1
rachel,James Brolin?,8,1
phoebe,"Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he's gay.",8,1
rachel,Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.,8,1
phoebe,Really?!,8,1
bandleader,"Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!",8,1
chandler,Before we go out there I've got a present for you.,8,1
monica,"Honey, I'm going to put my hand in your pocket!",8,1
chandler,No?,8,1
monica,No.,8,1
chandler,I've been taking dancing lessons.,8,1
monica,What?!,8,1
chandler,"Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.",8,1
monica,Oh that is so sweet!,8,1
chandler,So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?,8,1
monica,Yes.,8,1
monica,What's the matter?,8,1
chandler,"I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all slippery.",8,1
monica,"Well, are you going to be able to do this?",8,1
chandler,Not well.,8,1
monica,"Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.",8,1
phoebe,"So, are you ready to talk about it?",8,1
rachel,No.,8,1
phoebe,Now?,8,1
rachel,No!,8,1
phoebe,"Okay, we'll talk about something else then.",8,1
rachel,Thank you.,8,1
phoebe,Who's the father?!,8,1
rachel,"Ugh! Look honey you know what? I haven't told him yet, so until I do I don't think I should tell anybody else.",8,1
phoebe,Yeah. that is fine. that is fair. Is it Tag?,8,1
rachel,Phoebe!!,8,1

ross,"Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way  which uh, which was misleading. Well I'm-  Hello.",8,1
joey,"Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? Because if I can get in a Broadway show then I would've done it all, film, television, and theatre. The only think left would be radio, and that is just for ugly people.",8,1

rachel,Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that well.,8,1
monica,"Well, there's a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she's not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?",8,1

phoebe,Calm down. Maybe you are not pregnant.,8,1
rachel,What?!,8,1
phoebe,"When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.",8,1
monica,Yes! Maybe it's a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?,8,1
rachel,How many ways are there to do that?,8,1
phoebe,"I'm-I'm just saying, don't freak out until you are a hundred percent sure.",8,1

ross,"Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favour, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, ""Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?""  Yeah, then you did that.",8,2

monica,Or this one!,8,2
rachel,Hi.,8,2
monica,"Hey, how are you feeling'? Any morning sickness?",8,2

monica,No! Joey and Ross don't know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe's pregnant.,8,2
phoebe,"Yeah that is right Chandler does still think I'm pregnant. He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.  After you of course.",8,2
rachel,"Don't worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, Because I'm going to tell the father today.",8,2

phoebe,"Yeah. you are just going to knock on his door and change his life forever. you are like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.",8,2
rachel,"Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.",8,2
phoebe,"Pretty big? It's huge! God, this guy doesn't have a clue! He's just walking down the street thinking, 'I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!' then bam! He's a father and everything's different.",8,2
rachel,"Well it's only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I'm not going to ask him for anything.",8,2
phoebe,"Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he's walking around thinking, 'Do I want to be a dad?' and then bam!",8,2
monica,What was that bam?,8,2
phoebe,I don't. He got-he-he-he-he's hit by a bus.,8,2
joey,Hey!,8,2
rachel,"Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?",8,2
joey,Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I got to make a call!  I should have never walked into that Sunglass Hut!,8,2
rachel,"Oh Joey! Joey! No, it's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant!",8,2
joey,Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on?  Is somebody pregnant?,8,2

chandler,All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can't believe I screwed this up!,8,2
ross,I'm sorry man.  Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom. There's a band. There's going to be plenty of dressed up people.,8,2
chandler,Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?,8,2
ross,"No-no-no, I'm saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else's faces.",8,2
chandler,Are you serious?,8,2
ross,I'm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?,8,2
chandler,Marriage advice? Really?!,8,2
ross,"I'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren't these the same flowers?",8,2
chandler,"I don't know, Monica picked out the flowers.",8,2
ross,What about the chairs?,8,2
chandler,She picked those out too.,8,2

rachel,"What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?",8,2
phoebe,"I may play the fool at times, but I'm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit.  I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.",8,2

chandler,Eh?,8,2
monica,Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!,8,2
ross,"Huh, didn't see that coming.",8,2
chandler,"Okay, so this isn't a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with-with this lady. Which by the look on your face I'm sure you'll remember. So we don't need--There's no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.",8,2

monica,Hey! Good luck!,8,3
phoebe,"Yeah, bye.",8,3

chandler,What?! I didn't even know that-Why didn't you tell me?!  Why am I talking like this?!,8,3

phoebe,All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.,8,3
joey,"I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.",8,3
phoebe,What?! They took mine to give to you!,8,3
joey,Why would they take away our keys?,8,3
phoebe,Maybe they don't trust us.,8,3
joey,No that is not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.,8,3
phoebe,You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towels?,8,3
joey,"Hey, I washed those!",8,3
phoebe,No you didn't.,8,3

joey,"Yeah, I have stuff in there too.",8,3
phoebe,What stuff?,8,3
joey,"Monica's chicken parm! I'll take care of it.  Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency.  Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread.",8,3

phoebe,"Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.",8,3
joey,"Yeah, it seemed pretty important.",8,3
ross,Oh no.,8,3
phoebe,What?,8,3
ross,I think I might know what this is about.,8,3
joey,Really?,8,3
ross,"Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren't going to tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.",8,3
phoebe,And?,8,3
ross,Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.,8,3
phoebe,Oh sorry.  And?!,8,3
ross,"Well, we-we said we'd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may want to start things up again.",8,3
joey,"Yeah, I don't think that is what it is.",8,3
ross,Why? What-what else could it be?,8,3
joey,"Oh wow, I don't feel well.",8,3
ross,I'm telling you. I'm telling you. that is what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn't say anything to you?,8,3
phoebe,Maybe it's something you ate?,8,3
joey,"Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.",8,3
ross,"Yeah, I guess I should.  Man, you know what I have to realize? Maybe I'm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. You know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that.",8,3
ticket agent,Next?,8,3
monica,They're kissing let's just go around them.,8,3
chandler,"Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love.",8,3
monica,I'm in love too! But in an orderly fashion.,8,3

ticket agent,"Oh, let me see what I can do.  There are some first class seats available.",8,3
monica,Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.,8,3
chandler,We are on our honeymoon.,8,3
monica,Grab my ass!,8,3
ticket agent,Next?,8,3
monica,"Hi, sorry. I almost didn't hear you, because you know I'm just so in love with my new husband. We're on our honeymoon.",8,3
ticket agent,"Congratulations. Okay, Mr. Bing you'll be in 25J and Mrs. Bing you'll be in 25K.",8,3
monica,"Oh no, you see we're on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?",8,3
ticket agent,"I'm sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two.",8,3
monica,"You see, if we'd gone around them like I said, we-She would've given us those tickets. Damnit!",8,3
chandler,"25J and K, any chance those aren't together?",8,3
joey,I still can't believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.,8,3
phoebe,Of course I do! And I'm going to give it back to you as soon as they're done with it at the key shining place.,8,3
joey,What the hell is that?,8,3
joey,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?",8,3
mr. treeger,You said there was a gas leak in here.,8,3
phoebe,Well why don't you use your key?,8,3
mr. treeger,"Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at another building that I manage, people are going to start asking questions.  Come on! Hurry up.",8,3
phoebe,Oh! We could have done that.,8,3
monica,Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?,8,3
chandler,No.,8,3
monica,Me neither! We have to get in!,8,3
chandler,Just act like you belong.,8,3
monica,Oh my God! Oranges!,8,3
chandler,Shh!  Nice to see you again.,8,3
airline employee,"Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?",8,3
chandler,"Yes, of course.",8,3
airline employee,"I'm sorry, would you move your thumb? I can't see the seat number.",8,3
chandler,"Oh that is all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.",8,3
airline employee,"Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I'm sorry.",8,3
chandler,Apology accepted. Excuse us.,8,3

ross,"Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. that is been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?",8,3
rachel,What?,8,3

rachel,Seriously. What?!,8,3
ross,"Okay. Okay. You know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.",8,3
rachel,"Okay, you know what? Can I, can I talk now?",8,3
ross,Oh sure.,8,3
rachel,"I'm pregnant.  Ross?  Ross?  Okay, whenever you are ready.  And you are the father by the way-but you got that-",8,3
rachel,Can I get you some water?,8,3
ross,I'm good. I'm good.,8,3
rachel,"Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want.",8,3
ross,"Yeah, I need uh- I'm just-I don't know-I don't understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.",8,3
rachel,"I know. I know, but you know condoms only work like 97% of the time.",8,3
ross,What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!,8,3
rachel,They do!,8,3
ross,No they don't!!!  Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!,8,3
rachel,Okay Ross come on let's just forget about the condoms.,8,3
ross,Oh well I may as well have!,8,3
rachel,"Listen, you know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out-",8,3

ross,Yeah I'll press 1!,8,3
mr. treeger,I've looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.,8,3
joey,Huh. So then I can heat this up?,8,3
mr. treeger,"Anyway uh, I'll get moving on that new door.",8,3
phoebe,"Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favour and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? Because you know umm, they don't-they don't have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.",8,3
mr. treeger,"Well I'm going to have to put on a new lock, they'll find out anyway.",8,3
phoebe,Oh no.,8,3
mr. treeger,"Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I'll have to cancel my yoga class.  Hey Ross!",8,3
ross,Hi.,8,3
mr. treeger,Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?,8,3
ross,Sure.,8,3
mr. treeger,Namaste.,8,3
ross,Namaste.,8,3
ross,Oh my God! What happened to the door?!,8,3

ross,You already know don't you?,8,3
phoebe,A little bit.,8,3
joey,How are you doing?,8,3
ross,Okay. Okay. I mean I'll be okay. It's just I don't think I handled it very well.,8,3
joey,"Well, what did you say to her?",8,3
ross,Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.,8,3
phoebe,Oh Ross.,8,3
ross,"But hey, in my defence I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.",8,3
joey,What?,8,3
ross,I got to go find her.,8,3
joey,Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!,8,3

ross,"Right! Right! I just-I want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment-Although we could probably worry about that 'til after we get married.",8,3
rachel,What married?,8,3
ross,"Well yeah, I think we should get married.",8,3
rachel,"What, because that is your answer to everything?",8,3
ross,"No, because that is the right thing to do.",8,3
rachel,"Yeah, maybe if you are in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?",8,3
ross,No but-but still you can't possibly do this alone.,8,3
rachel,Excuse me?,8,3
ross,"Come on Rach, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant.",8,3

dr. long,Am I interrupting?,8,3

rachel,I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!,8,3

chandler,"Yeah, we're going to need to see that tape.",8,4
monica,"Yeah, definitely.",8,4

ross,Thank you.  No!,8,4
joey,you are right.,8,4
ross,Joey! No!,8,4
joey,Loud and clear!,8,4

joey,"Uh no Rach, he's gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.",8,4
rachel,"Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it?  Oh forget it!  Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.",8,4
ross,"Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it! Anyway, here.  I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.",8,4
rachel,Thank you.  What?  You don't want to see this do you?,8,4
monica,Hell yeah!!!,8,4
rachel,I am not going to show you this!,8,4
phoebe,"No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.",8,4
ross,"Forget it, she's destroying it.",8,4
phoebe,"Okay fine! Fine! We'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!!",8,4
ross,"Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.",8,4
rachel,I want to see it.,8,4
ross,What?!,8,4

joey,Are we watching' the tape or not?!,8,4

rachel,kind of hurting' my hand though.,8,4

chandler,Did you do it on our invitations?!,8,4

rachel,Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.,8,4
ross,"I know. Hey remember-remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost-",8,4
rachel,"Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would've gone through with it? You know, if we hadn't gotten caught. Do you think we would've done it?",8,4
ross,"I mean I-I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.",8,4
rachel,Oh I wanted to.,8,4

rachel,"Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him. You know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nut-Which I'm not! I'm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favourite ice cream flavour is butter pecan.  And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally. Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.",8,5
joey,Here we go! Here we go!,8,5
rachel,"Oh, we're leaving. Bye Kash.",8,5
kash,Bye.,8,5
rachel,Say hi to Wally.,8,5
phoebe,Ooh Monica!,8,5
monica,Hi!,8,5
phoebe,"Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can't wait to get sous-neath him.",8,5
monica,I-I have to fire him.,8,5
phoebe,But why?!,8,5
monica,"Because he's terrible! Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!",8,5
phoebe,"Well maybe he was just nervous, you know you can be very intimidating. And besides I've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.",8,5
monica,"Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.",8,5
phoebe,"But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?",8,5
monica,"All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!",8,5
phoebe,"that is fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.",8,5
monica,I paid to have this done.,8,5
phoebe,Love it!,8,5
joey,Hey!,8,5
rachel,Hi!,8,5
joey,"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",8,5
rachel,I thought I was a complete idiot.,8,5
joey,"Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.",8,5
rachel,"Oh! Oh, I think I'm going to throw up a little bit. What did you say?",8,5
joey,I said no.,8,5
rachel,What?!,8,5
joey,What? I-I just figured since you are pregnant you are not going to be seeing people.,8,5
rachel,"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?",8,5
joey,I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.,8,5
rachel,"Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?",8,5
joey,"Rach look, I really don't think that is such a great-",8,5
rachel,"Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet them all!",8,5
chandler,Hey Bob.,8,5
bob,Hey! How's my pal Toby doing today?,8,5
chandler,"If I see him, I'll ask.",8,5
bob,Toby!,8,5
mr. franklin,Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?,8,5
chandler,Yeah!,8,5
mr. franklin,Oh then you know each other.,8,5
chandler,We're on a semi-first name basis.,8,5
mr. franklin,What do you think of adding him to our team?,8,5
chandler,"Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes.",8,5
mr. franklin,Really? They love him down on six.,8,5
chandler,But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard up here.,8,5
mr. franklin,"Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.",8,5
chandler,I think it's best sir.,8,5
mr. franklin,But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. I've got a stack of documents on my desk this high.,8,5
chandler,"You know what you should do, just toss them in the shedder and claim you never got them.",8,5
mr. franklin,that is a good one.,8,5
chandler,What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!,8,5
phoebe,Hey!,8,5
monica,"Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!",8,5
phoebe,But-,8,5
monica,"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!""",8,5
phoebe,"Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.",8,5
monica,Why not?!,8,5
phoebe,Because I'm dumping him today.,8,5
monica,What?! You said he was sweet!,8,5
phoebe,"He is sweet. He's too sweet. He calls me all the time.  ""So did-did you get home from work okay?"" ""Did-did you get out of the shower okay?""",8,5
monica,Just don't pick up your phone.,8,5
phoebe,"Then he comes over!  ""I'm so worried about you."" Uck! Be a man!",8,5
monica,What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?,8,5
phoebe,"You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself.",8,5
monica,"Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.",8,5
phoebe,"Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I'll kill myself!",8,5
monica,"Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!",8,5
phoebe,Okay. But the question is who's going to go first. Because whoever goes second is the bitch.,8,5
monica,What do you mean?,8,5
phoebe,"Come on! The boss that fires a guy that is just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that is just been fired, blond bitch!",8,5
monica,I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.,8,5
phoebe,"All right, that makes sense.  Ugh. But-Screw you I'm going first!",8,5
bob,"Hey Toby, you got a sec?",8,5
chandler,"Sure, what's up?",8,5
bob,"I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not going to happen. Apparently somebody thinks I'm not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler?",8,5
rachel,"Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight. ""Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon,"" or ""I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?""",8,5
ross,Hey!,8,5
rachel,Hi!,8,5
joey,Hey!,8,5
ross,"So, what do you want to do tonight? There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that is supposed to be very powerful. Interested?",8,5
joey,No. No. But I'll go see a normal person movie with you.,8,5
ross,Rach? You want to come?,8,5
rachel,"Oh no, I can't. I got a date.",8,5
ross,A date?,8,5
rachel,Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?,8,5
ross,"Why no, it's the opposite of weird. It's-it's uh, regular. It's-it's uh, it's mundane. It's actually uh, a little dull.",8,5
joey,It's no Ukrainian film.,8,5
rachel,Yeah-Ooh! Earrings!,8,5
ross,A date?! She's-she's got a date?! With who?,8,5
joey,I set her up with this actor on my show.,8,5
ross,You set her up?!,8,5
joey,No,8,5
ross,Joey what-what were you thinking?!,8,5
joey,"Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!",8,5
ross,"Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this  actor taking them?",8,5
joey,Hey! I'm an  actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.,8,5
ross,A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!,8,5
joey,Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?,8,5
ross,Why don't they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that is a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! that is fun too! Whew!!,8,5
kash,Hey Joey.,8,5
joey,"Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.",8,5
kash,Hey.,8,5
ross,Hi. I-I hear you are going on a ferry tonight.,8,5
kash,Yeah.,8,5
ross,A bit of a daredevil are we?,8,5
rachel,Hey guys do you think this is too slutty-Hi Kash!,8,5
kash,Hey Rachel! You ready to go?,8,5
rachel,"Yeah! All right, I'll see you guys later.",8,5
ross,Okay. Have a great time you guys.,8,5
rachel,Thank you.,8,5
kash,Thank you.,8,5
ross,Yes it is too slutty!,8,5
tim,Hi!,8,5
phoebe,Hi.,8,5
tim,"Oh, I'm so glad you called. I feel like it's always me calling you. So, what's up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?",8,5
phoebe,"It will be-in a minute. Listen, Tim you are a really great guy.",8,5
tim,It's because I'm with you.,8,5
phoebe,Aw.  I'm just-I'm in a place in my life right now where I-I-,8,5
tim,"Whoops. Sorry.  This just in.  Oh, it's 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away.",8,5
phoebe,Oh-oh no she doesn't! I know what that is. You can stay.,8,5
tim,"Aww, I'll miss you too Pheebs.  And I will be holding you, right here.",8,5
joey,So what movie do you want to see-And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.,8,5
ross,Books?,8,5
joey,"All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!",8,5
ross,"Well, I tell you what. Why don't we uh, why don't we just stay here? Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang.",8,5
joey,And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?,8,5
ross,"Hey, if that is what you want to do I'm not going to say no.",8,5
joey,Dude! What is going on?!,8,5
ross,I just-I have to find out how it went.,8,5
joey,Why?,8,5
ross,This guy could be my baby's stepfather!,8,5
joey,They go on one date and you are worried about them getting married?! He's not you!,8,5
ross,I just-I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!,8,5
joey,"Well Ross, what did you think she was going to do?",8,5
ross,I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.,8,5
joey,What do you mean?,8,5
ross,"It's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan's, it's like-It breaks my heart a little. I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. You know? Maybe fight over the science section.",8,5
joey,that is a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!,8,5
ross,No! No I can't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.,8,5
joey,"Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?",8,5
ross,It used to be. Now she doesn't really have a face. Smoking' body though.,8,5
joey,"Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel.",8,5
ross,No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?,8,5
joey,"I know, but I don't think that is what she wants.",8,5
ross,"No, it's not what I want either. I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.",8,5
joey,"that is okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not going to be what you thought, but no matter what there's going to be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?",8,5
ross,Yeah.,8,5
joey,"Hey, I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!",8,5
ross,We can still catch that Ukrainian film.,8,5
joey,"No, I said fun!",8,5

chandler,"Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.",8,5
bob,Toby don't.,8,5
chandler,Bob!,8,5
bob,Toby! I'm not going to let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!,8,5
chandler,Well that puts me in a difficult position.,8,5

phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm just-I'm-I'm just not ready for a relationship right now.",8,5
monica,"Yeah and-and I'm sorry too. But, well I just-I like things done a certain way and the chemistry's just not right.",8,5
phoebe,"Oh that is good, the chemistry thing for us too.",8,5
tim,"Wow! Umm, okay. Umm-  I-I-I realize I came on a little strong but, it's only because I think you are so amazing.

monica,Tim wait!,8,5

ross,"Ah, he didn't uh, take it so well?",8,5
rachel,"Well better than you, but you know still not what you want.",8,5
ross,Oh?,8,5
rachel,"He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, ""Yeah, I hear those haemorrhoids are a bitch.""",8,5
ross,He sounds swell.,8,5
rachel,Doesn't he?,8,5
ross,"Hey, want to-want to a little cheering up?",8,5

rachel,Oh it's all right. I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing. It's one more thing in my life that is suddenly completely different. This is hard.,8,5
ross,"Yeah I know.  On the other hand in um, in about seven months you are going to have something that you are going to love more than any guy you've ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.",8,5

phoebe,I love the second grade!,8,6
eric,Really?,8,6

eric,So what do you do?,8,6
phoebe,"Umm, I'm a masseuse-by day.",8,6
eric,"You know you don't have to stand here with me, believe me-",8,6

monica,Yeah-,8,6
joey,"But between you and Phoebe, I'd have to give the edge to Phoebe.",8,6
monica,What?! Really?!,8,6
joey,"Are you kidding'? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she's got this crazy temper. She-She's not standing right behind me is she?",8,6
monica,"No you are fine.  All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?",8,6
joey,I'm not sure.,8,6
monica,What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here!  As hard as you can!,8,6
joey,Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn't matter.,8,6

rachel,"Well, that-that is not your choice. Happy Halloween!",8,6
boy in the cape,This isn't fair.,8,6
rachel,Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I got to give you free stuff?,8,6
boy in the cape,Shut up!,8,6
rachel,You shut up!,8,6
boy in the cape,You can't tell me to shut up!,8,6

chandler,That means nothing to me.  Come on!,8,6
phoebe,Hi liar!,8,6
ursula,Hey!,8,6

ursula,Well they could be true.,8,6
phoebe,But they're not!,8,6
ursula,"Yeah, it's a fine line huh?",8,6

phoebe,"Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.",8,6
eric,"Well, I guess I'll see you at the wedding.",8,6
phoebe,"Umm listen, I don't think-I don't think I'm going to make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.",8,6
eric,I think we'll be okay. Besides it's so perfect and  she's been saving herself for me.,8,6
phoebe,Okay I can't let you do this! She's lying to you.,8,6
eric,What?,8,6
phoebe,"She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me.  Okay. Okay. Yeah-Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.  Okay, here's the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here's her driver license, this ought to be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?",8,6
eric,She told me she was 25.,8,6
phoebe,"Oh, I almost don't want to show this.  Just remember I'm a minute younger.",8,6
eric,I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She's not a teacher. There's not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.,8,6
phoebe,"No. you are not, you are not stupid.",8,6
eric,I'm not smart.  I just wanted so much to-be impulsive once. To be romantic.,8,6
phoebe,"that is good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just-you did it with the wrong person.  What?",8,6
eric,"It's just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.",8,6
ursula,Eric!! Let's go!!,8,6
eric,"I'd better go, deal-",8,6
phoebe,"Yeah, you should.",8,6
ursula,Hurry up I got to pray!!,8,6
joey,Hey!,8,6
rachel,"Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.",8,6
joey,that is not so bad.,8,6
rachel,"No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!",8,6
joey,"Come on! you are good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween. You know, they're all greedy and hopped up on sugar!",8,6
rachel,Really? You think that is all it is?,8,6
joey,"Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas-and their birthdays. kind of get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they're hungry or sleepy. You know, kids are tough. Good luck with that.",8,6
monica,"Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost.",8,6
chandler,"Listen, I've got a secret for you. I let him win.",8,6
monica,Is that a secret or a lie.,8,6
chandler,"No, I let him win-Ross!",8,6
ross,Yeah?,8,6
chandler,Would you tell her I let you win please?,8,6
ross,"Oh. Yeah.  Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler's really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse!",8,6
chandler,I am strong! I'll show you!,8,6
monica,Chandler please!,8,6

chandler,"You know uh, I didn't actually do this.",8,7
monica,"Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?",8,7
chandler,"No, it wasn't you.",8,7
monica,Well then who?,8,7
chandler,I got a maid. Yay!,8,7
monica,"I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then-",8,7
chandler,"Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control-",8,7
monica,"Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!",8,7
chandler,"Look, she's really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.",8,7
monica,Did she really say that?,8,7
chandler,"Yes, I distinctly remember Because I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?",8,7
monica,"Fine, I can do it.  Whew.",8,7
chandler,What's the matter?,8,7
monica,"Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!",8,7
phoebe,Who's cell phone is that? It's just so annoying; everywhere you go.,8,7
ross,I think it's coming from your bag.,8,7
phoebe,I never get calls!!  Hello?,8,7
eric,"Hi, it's Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursula's fiance.",8,7
phoebe,"Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how'd you get this number?",8,7
eric,"Oh, I have a friend who's a cop and he got it for me.",8,7
phoebe,Wow! What an incredible violation-and wonderful surprise.,8,7
eric,"Uh listen, I just-I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.",8,7
phoebe,Oh you did?  He did it! He did it!,8,7
rachel,Wow! What did he do?,8,7
phoebe,Shh! I'm talking.,8,7
eric,"Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who-eats lunch.",8,7
phoebe,Are you asking me out? Because it would be kind of weird since you just broke up with my sister.,8,7
eric,Yeah uh-okay. I'm-I'm sorry. Bye.,8,7
phoebe,No! Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person. Fight for me.,8,7
eric,"Uhh, I won't take no for an answer.",8,7
phoebe,"Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.",8,7
eric,Great! But who-who-How do you know where I live?,8,7
phoebe,"I've got friends too. Okay, bye.",8,7
eric,Bye.,8,7
phoebe,"Oh my God! I'm going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really going to be so much better than I thought it was going to be. Oh Ross, I can't make lunch.",8,7
ross,So apparently I'm available for lunch.,8,7
rachel,I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.,8,7
ross,you are moving?,8,7
rachel,"Yeah, I can't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be,  ""How you doin'?""",8,7
ross,So does-does Joey know you are moving?,8,7
rachel,"Well, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's going to be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.",8,7
ross,that is not really porn.,8,7
rachel,Not so much.,8,7
ross,"Hey, you know what and if you are looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.",8,7
rachel,Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?,8,7
ross,"Well I don't know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want.  With your permission.",8,7
rachel,Yeah that would really be great.,8,7
ross,Yeah.,8,7
rachel,Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn't. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.,8,7
ross,Yeah. No. No you are right.,8,7
rachel,Shall we?,8,7
ross,Yeah.,8,7
mrs. verhoeven's daughter,Yes?,8,7
ross,Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.,8,7
rachel,"And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.",8,7
ross,I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I'm so sorry for your loss.,8,7
mrs. verhoeven's daughter,She didn't pass.,8,7
ross,What?,8,7
mrs. verhoeven's daughter,My mother's still alive.,8,7
ross,"Oh, thank God!",8,7
mrs. verhoeven's daughter,"It looked like we were going to lose her this morning, but she's a tough old bird.",8,7
rachel,Ahh.,8,7
mrs. verhoeven's daughter,Are you close with her?,8,7
ross,"Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in  the laundry room.",8,7
mrs. verhoeven's daughter,You speak Dutch?  Zeer vereerd een vriend van mijn moeder te ontmoeten.,8,7
ross,You know I would it's just painful.,8,7
rachel,So she's really not dead.,8,7
mrs. verhoeven's daughter,"No, she's hanging in there.",8,7
rachel,"Hmm. Do you think-Could you tell me if she's hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?",8,7
brenda,"Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where'd you get it?",8,7
monica,"Oh well umm, I make it myself! It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is-You know what? We just met.",8,7
brenda,"Okay. Uhh, I'm going to go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back I'll clean behind the refrigerator.",8,7
monica,I love her.,8,7
brenda,I'll be back in a minute.,8,7
monica,Okay.,8,7
chandler,See? I told you.,8,7
monica,She stole my jeans!,8,7
chandler,What?,8,7
monica,I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!,8,7
chandler,So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?,8,7
monica,Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!,8,7
chandler,She must've been planning this for years!,8,7
monica,I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!,8,7
chandler,"Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?",8,7
monica,I guess.,8,7
chandler,"So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go-snooping around her crotch?",8,7
monica,Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.,8,7
chandler,"Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?",8,7
monica,Yeah!,8,7
phoebe,Hi!,8,7
eric,"Come in, I'm so glad you are here.",8,7
phoebe,"Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.",8,7
eric,"Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.",8,7
phoebe,Oh.,8,7
eric,"Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I just-I got so angry just looking at her--face.",8,7
phoebe,Yeah.  Yeah.,8,7
eric,I'm sorry. I just-when I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.,8,7
phoebe,Maybe this is too weird.,8,7
eric,No wait! There's only a problem when I look at you.  Oh I got it! I got it.,8,7
phoebe,No don't tear out your eyes!!,8,7
eric,"I was just, I was just going to take out my lenses.",8,7
phoebe,"Oh, yeah try that.  So, is that better?",8,7
eric,"Not really. You-you are blurry, but you still look like Ursula. you are Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe-If I-if I just don't look at you for a while.  See? It-it works. I'm not, I'm not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!",8,7
phoebe,"Look Eric, turn around.  Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. You know? This is our first date you know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and 'Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and you know first kisses and--second kisses.",8,7
ross,"Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.",8,7
gunther,Jij spreekt Nederlands? Dat is te gek. Heb je familie daar?,8,7
ross,"Yeah, we're done.",8,7
gunther,Ezel.,8,7
ross,Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?,8,7
joey,"Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?",8,7
ross,Really?!,8,7
joey,"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",8,7
ross,Sweet!,8,7
joey,"All right, well finish your coffee; let's go.",8,7
ross,Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,8,7
joey,"To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you are not going to be on TV!",8,7
ross,"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",8,7
joey,"Oh, you are switching apartments?",8,7
ross,"It's not for me, it's for Rachel.",8,7
joey,But Rachel has an apartment.,8,7
ross,"Yeah, but when the baby comes she's going to want to move.",8,7
joey,She is?,8,7
ross,"Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?",8,7
joey,I guess I didn't really think about it.,8,7
ross,Ezel!  Hey Gunther! you are an ezel!,8,7
gunther,Jij hebt seks met ezels.,8,7
ross,Damnit!,8,7
monica,Nice jeans!,8,7
brenda,Oh thanks! I like your top.,8,7
monica,Oh.   you are not getting' it.,8,7
brenda,What happened?!,8,7
monica,"Oh, I fell asleep.",8,7
brenda,I was thinking about taking my lunch break.,8,7
monica,"Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That'll really work up your appetite for lunch.",8,7
brenda,All right.,8,7
monica,Hello.,8,7
brenda,What's going on?!,8,7
monica,"I'm sorry. I've never had a maid before, is this not okay?",8,7
rachel,Hey!,8,7
joey,Hey!,8,7
rachel,How was the game?,8,7
joey,"Oh, okay. I-I ate way too much.",8,7
rachel,Oh.,8,7
joey,"Ooh.  So umm, I was talking' to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.",8,7
rachel,Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.,8,7
joey,I was kind of hoping you'd stay.,8,7
rachel,"Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.",8,7
joey,"No room? It's a baby. It's like this big. you know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here.  Or-or-or we could put it right here.  Aw, it's cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here.  You wouldn't even notice it. Where's the baby?",8,7
rachel,"Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there's a screaming baby around.",8,7
joey,I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.,8,7
rachel,"Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.",8,7
joey,I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.,8,7
rachel,I know.,8,7
joey,You know I blame Ross for this.,8,7
rachel,I do too a little bit.,8,7
joey,"I'm going to miss you, you are the hottest roommate I ever had.",8,7
phoebe,"Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.",8,7
eric,"Oh no, stay here we'll keep doing this. I'll pay you.",8,7
phoebe,"No, I got in trouble for that before. I'll see you later.",8,7
eric,Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.,8,7
phoebe,Really? that is the thing I'm worse at! You'll see.,8,7
chandler,Hi!,8,7
monica,"Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.",8,7
chandler,How come?,8,7
monica,Because I put my head between her legs.,8,7
chandler,To see her pants?,8,7
monica,They're my pants!,8,7
chandler,Are you sure? Did you see the stain?,8,7
monica,No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.,8,7
chandler,"God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?",8,7
monica,Fine.  She's wearing my bra!,8,7
chandler,Oh dear God!,8,7
monica,My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!,8,7
chandler,And yet you don't recognize that you are crazy.,8,7
monica,Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!,8,7
chandler,Here's another plan-No!,8,7
monica,I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her!,8,7
chandler,Why?,8,7
monica,Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!,8,7
chandler,I fear a jury will see it the same way!,8,7
monica,"Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time!",8,7
chandler,You see that?,8,7
monica,Do you see this?,8,7
chandler,All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!,8,7
monica,"Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.",8,7
chandler,You need new clothes.,8,7
ross,Hi. How is she?,8,7
mrs. verhoeven's daughter,It's not looking good.,8,7
ross,"Oh.  Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen.",8,7
mrs. verhoeven's daughter,that is so sweet.  Would you like to come in and say good-bye? I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.,8,7
ross,Oh I don't know that it would.,8,7
mrs. verhoeven's daughter,"Well, her memory is pretty much gone.",8,7
ross,All right then.,8,7
phoebe,Hey!,8,7

phoebe,Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! you know what? This is too weird.,8,7

phoebe,So I guess this is it.,8,7
eric,Yeah.  Maybe it's for the best. You smell just like her.,8,7

brenda,Okay.,8,7
chandler,Brenda a bee!,8,7
brenda,What?,8,7
chandler,Yes! It's flown into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!,8,7
brenda,I think I know what's going on here.,8,7
chandler,You do?,8,7
brenda,"Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it's wrong. you are married.",8,7
chandler,I totally understand.  Can I just see your bra?,8,7
rachel,Hi!,8,7
monica,Where did you get those jeans?!,8,7
rachel,You gave them to me!,8,7
monica,No I didn't!,8,7
rachel,"All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.",8,7
monica,Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!,8,7
rachel,What bra?,8,7
monica,The pink one with the flowers?!,8,7
rachel,You mean the one that you are wearing?,8,7
brenda,I quit!,8,7
monica,Sounds about right.,8,7
rachel,What is this?,8,7
joey,"Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here,  so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh-Oh look! Here's a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?",8,7
rachel,you are so sweet.  Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!,8,7
joey,Ah-. That-that-that is really just to show where the baby would go. You know why don't I hold on to him so that there's no confusion?,8,7
rachel,"But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud.",8,7
joey,I'm loud!,8,7
rachel,It's going to be up all night!,8,7
joey,I'm up all night!,8,7
rachel,It's going to poop!,8,7
joey,Hello!,8,7
rachel,What about all the women you want to bring home?,8,7
joey,"Look, if I'm bringing home a woman who can't stand being around a baby, then maybe I don't want to be with that woman! Or maybe we'll just do it in the bathroom of the club!",8,7
rachel,"Joey, are you sure?",8,7
joey,"Yeah! All right-Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay? But, it'll also be really-really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.",8,7
rachel,I want me to stay too.,8,7
joey,OH!,8,7
rachel,Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!,8,7
joey,I know! I found it on the street.,8,7
rachel,Are you serious-Really?! It's in such good condition.,8,7
joey,Yeah.,8,7
rachel,Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?,8,7
joey,I don't know.,8,7
rachel,It's moving.,8,7
joey,Ew.,8,7
rachel,It's still--It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!,8,7
joey,Ooh! Ah! Okay!,8,7
ross,"Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don't care,  because you got the apartment. Yes!",8,7
rachel,Eww. Yeah. Umm. I think I'm going to stay here.,8,7
joey,Isn't that great?,8,7
ross,Ezels!!,8,7
rachel,Hey Pheebs?,8,8
phoebe,Huh?,8,8
rachel,"I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you want to come?",8,8
phoebe,"Sure. Yeah, he's kind of sexy.",8,8
rachel,"Oh no, no, I'll be there too.",8,8
phoebe,"Okay so, we'll just come up with some kind of signal if it's going well you can take off.",8,8
rachel,No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.,8,8
phoebe,Oh. Why not?,8,8
rachel,Cause I know he's going to flip out and I hate it when he's angry.,8,8
phoebe,"Oh Rachel, this is all so 'Papa don't preach.'",8,8
rachel,What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he'd make me eat the entire pack.,8,8
phoebe,"Wow! Oh well, I will be there!",8,8
rachel,Thank you.,8,8
phoebe,Gosh. I'm not going to let that man make you eat your baby.  Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.,8,8
monica,No you don't!,8,8
rachel,No you don't.,8,8
phoebe,Oh my God!!! Monica!! He's the stripper from your bachelorette party!!,8,8
chandler,Her what?!!,8,8
phoebe,Your secret bachelorette party-,8,8
chandler,You had a bachelorette party?!,8,8
phoebe,She untied his G-string with her teeth.  Somebody stop me!,8,8
chandler,"I thought we weren't going to have bachelor/bachelorette parties! You know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.",8,8
joey,It's a grand tradition!,8,8
monica,"I'm sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!",8,8
rachel,Well you could've untied it with your hands.,8,8
joey,"This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!",8,8
chandler,You went home with the waitress.,8,8
joey,"Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.",8,8
chandler,I can't believe you didn't tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!,8,8
monica,"Ugh, I knew giving you that book was going to come back and bite me in the ass!",8,8
dr. green,How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?,8,8
phoebe,"Oh, I-I don't eat meat.",8,8
dr. green,It's chicken.,8,8
phoebe,"Yeah, I don't eat that either.",8,8
dr. green,"I'll never understand you lesbians.  So baby, tell me-what is new with you.",8,8
rachel,Well actually umm-,8,8
waiter,Your '74 Lafite sir.,8,8
dr. green,74?! I ordered the '75! that is a magnificent wine! The '74 is sewage! Why would you bring me sewage?!  Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why you are a waiter?,8,8
waiter,This is why I told the manager I wouldn't wait on you tonight!,8,8
dr. green,Oh come on! Don't be such a baby!,8,8
rachel,"In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.",8,8
phoebe,"He's right though, the '74 is absolute piss.",8,8
rachel,"This was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him Phoebe. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't-",8,8
phoebe,Rachel!,8,8
rachel,"No it's okay, this is what's going to happen. I'm going to wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.",8,8
phoebe,"Why, so he can get mad at the baby?",8,8
rachel,"Hey, that is the-baby's problem.  Oh, everything okay with the waiter?",8,8
dr. green,"I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.",8,8
rachel,"Well- Umm, I got TiVo.",8,8
dr. green,What's TiVo?,8,8
phoebe,It's slang for pregnant.,8,8
rachel,Phoebe!,8,8
dr. green,Are you really pregnant?,8,8
rachel,"Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.",8,8
dr. green,Who is the father? Oh no! Please don't tell me it's her!,8,8
rachel,"No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross.  Oh daddy, I hope you are okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. you are going to-This is your first grandchild! you are going to be a poppy!",8,8
dr. green,that is true.,8,8
rachel,Yeah.,8,8
dr. green,"Poppy.  Oh, I'm going to be a poppy.  So when is the wedding?",8,8
rachel,Who?,8,8
dr. green,"The wedding! There's going to be a wedding. Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard!  Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is going to be a wedding!!",8,8
rachel,February 2nd!,8,8
mona,So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.,8,8
ross,Oh thanks. Although it kind of seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.,8,8
mona,"Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and you know take it all in.",8,8
ross,"Yeah, a lot of my students do that.",8,8
mona,"So, I got to get going.",8,8
ross,"Okay, I-I'll see you tonight.",8,8
mona,Yeah.,8,8
ross,"Okay, bye.",8,8
mona,"Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!",8,8
chandler,My God! You must be good in bed!,8,8
joey,"So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How's it going?",8,8
ross,"Ah, it's good. It's going good. I mean, we get along great. She's, she's so-",8,8
joey,Hot?,8,8
ross,"Well, I was going to say sweet, but yeah-huh!",8,8
chandler,She's okay with Rachel and the baby?,8,8
ross,"Well I-I haven't actually told her yet. I don't want to scare her off, you know?",8,8
chandler,"Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you are going down the same path, but you are really going down different ones.",8,8
joey,I'm going to take that book and beat you to death with it.,8,8
monica,"Oh my God! You are going to love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you are going to have a bachelor party.",8,8
chandler,What?,8,8
monica,"Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!",8,8
chandler,Honey! that is crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper-,8,8
joey,Will you let the lady talk?!,8,8
monica,"Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better.",8,8
chandler,"Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy. You know? I'm not a bachelor anymore.",8,8
monica,"So don't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a-a two month anniversary present.",8,8
ross,"Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lap dance!",8,8
monica,Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!,8,8
chandler,All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!,8,8
joey,Yeah!,8,8
chandler,And Joey.,8,8
monica,"Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?",8,8
chandler,"Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.",8,8
ross,"Uh actually, sorry I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.",8,8
chandler,I understand,8,8
joey,I'm sorry I got to cancel tonight baby-,8,8
phoebe,"I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.",8,8
rachel,"I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.",8,8
phoebe,It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.,8,8
rachel,"All right here he comes. I'm going to do this, I'm going to tell him, I'm going to be strong.",8,8
dr. green,I just called a friend of mine.,8,8
rachel,Yeah?,8,8
dr. green,I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.,8,8
rachel,"Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!!  Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.",8,8
dr. green,What is it sweetie?,8,8
rachel,There's not going to be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.,8,8
dr. green,What?!,8,8
rachel,I'm sorry daddy.,8,8
dr. green,I don't believe this!!,8,8
rachel,"Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.",8,8
dr. green,Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable Rachel! And I want to know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?! that is it! Is that it?!,8,8
rachel,"Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged goods.",8,8
joey,"So you uh, nervous about getting married?",8,8
chandler,What are you doing?,8,8
joey,"Look, look let's pretend it's a real bachelor party. Okay? You know? Before your wedding. Come on, it'll be fun.",8,8
chandler,Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.,8,8
joey,How does it feel knowing you are never going to be with another woman again huh? Knowing you are going to have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.,8,8
chandler,"you are right, this is more fun.",8,8
joey,"that is her! Okay, come on!",8,8
stripper,Hi!,8,8
chandler,Hi.,8,8
stripper,So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?,8,8
joey,"Uh, that-that is-that is me!",8,8
chandler,that is me.,8,8
joey,"Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.",8,8
stripper,So is that a bedroom?,8,8
chandler,"Yeah, yeah right over there.",8,8
stripper,"All right, whenever you are ready.",8,8
chandler,That was weird.,8,8
joey,Why-why would she go in the bedroom?,8,8
stripper,I'm waiting.,8,8
chandler,So she's a-,8,8
joey,"Yeah, that is one naked hooker!",8,8
mona,I love your place! Where is this guy from?,8,8
ross,Uh that is an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.,8,8
mona,"Oh wow! So, you are more than just dinosaurs.",8,8
ross,So much more.,8,8
mona,Oh my God! Oh my God! I'm so sorry!,8,8
ross,"Aw forget it, it's from Pier One.  Sorry.",8,8
dr. green,You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I'm going to kill you!!,8,8
ross,You know this is actually not a great time for me.,8,8
dr. green,So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!,8,8
mona,You got Rachel pregnant?!,8,8
ross,Who did?!,8,8
dr. green,You did!,8,8
ross,"Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.",8,8
dr. green,Oh? Really? that is what my daughter means to you? Nothing?,8,8
ross,"No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care-I-I love Rachel.",8,8
mona,What?!,8,8
ross,"Oh but not that way. I mean-I mean I'm not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.",8,8
dr. green,Oh really? that is how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?,8,8
ross,Hey! I offered to marry her!,8,8
mona,Wh-,8,8
ross,But I didn't want to.,8,8
dr. green,Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!,8,8
mona,Tramp?!,8,8
ross,"I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.",8,8
chandler,I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!,8,8
joey,"Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do.",8,8
chandler,"Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  Ma'am, are you also a stripper?",8,8
hooker,"Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that is going to cost extra. Okay, here's the extras, handcuffs, spanking-",8,8
joey,"Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya. you know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that is pretty funny.",8,8
chandler,"That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.",8,8
joey,I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.,8,8
hooker,Do you mind if I smoke in here?,8,8
chandler,"Oh actually, I'd rather you-Yeah, go ahead. We're going to have to burn that room down anyway.",8,8
mona,How could you have kept all of this from me?,8,8
ross,"I was going to tell you, but-",8,8
dr. green,But what?! You figured you'd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!,8,8
ross,Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just-  Why don't we just let the machine get that?,8,8
joey,Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.,8,8
ross,"No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I-I need to, I need to lie down.",8,8
stu,"So, tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?",8,8
monica,Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl's number.,8,8
stu,No problem. So who's the party for?,8,8
monica,My husband.,8,8
stu,You hired your husband a hooker?,8,8
monica,She's a stripper.,8,8
stu,"No, she's a hooker.",8,8
monica,"Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?",8,8
stu,When they're hookers.,8,8
monica,Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?,8,8
stu,"Either that or she's just the best, most expensive date I ever had.",8,8
joey,Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.,8,8
chandler,Why would she do that?,8,8
joey,"Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you are really bad at you know, sexually?",8,8
chandler,This is the worst bachelor party ever!,8,8
hooker,What's taking you boys so long?,8,8
joey,In a minute!,8,8
chandler,In a minute? What's going to happen in a minute?!,8,8
joey,"All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.",8,8
chandler,Why me?!,8,8
joey,Hey! It's your bachelor party.,8,8
chandler,Which is why you should do it.,8,8
joey,I don't want to. You do it!,8,8
chandler,You do it!,8,8
joey,You do it!,8,8
chandler,"All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!  What?",8,8
joey,I miss this.,8,8
chandler,I don't think we've actually done this before!,8,8
joey,"No, I-I miss hanging out with you.",8,8
chandler,Well we-we still hang out.,8,8
joey,Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. You know now it's like-things are different.,8,8
chandler,"Well you know, things are different. I'm-I'm married now.",8,8
joey,"Oh sure-And hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just-I miss-hanging out-just-just us, you know?",8,8
chandler,"Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we'll make time to hang out with each other.",8,8
joey,You got it. Come here.,8,8
hooker,"Oh God! Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys.",8,8
monica,"She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a-  Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone.",8,8
ross,So your dad dropped by. He's a pleasant man!,8,8
rachel,Oh no-,8,8
phoebe,I'd better go.  Just over here,8,8
rachel,"Ross I'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",8,8
ross,I don't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!,8,8
rachel,"Oh okay, I'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address?",8,8
ross,Rachel!,8,8
rachel,"All right, I promise. I'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her.",8,8
ross,Okay!,8,8
rachel,Okay.,8,8
ross,Thank you!,8,8
phoebe,"that is it?! You call that a fight? Come on! ""We were on a break!"" ""No we weren't!"" What happened to you two?!",8,8
ross,Thank you so much for coming back over.,8,8
mona,"Oh good, you are here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.",8,8
rachel,"I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. you are going to have to tell me how you did that.",8,8
ross,Focus.,8,8
rachel,"Okay. Um-But-Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are going to have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.",8,8
mona,How can I be sure on that?,8,8
rachel,Oh we just-we drove each other crazy!,8,8
ross,Yeah.,8,8
rachel,"I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!",8,8
ross,Trying to date this woman.,8,8
rachel,"Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.",8,8
ross,Probably shouldn't touch me.,8,8
mona,"You know, I-I-I just-I don't want to get in the middle of something so complicated.",8,8
rachel,"I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single?  I am so going to leave right now.",8,8
ross,Should I leave this open for you too?,8,8
mona,I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?,8,8
ross,Because what's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.,8,8
mona,Yeah? Well you still should have told me.,8,8
ross,"I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel's father. Look I-I made a mistake, but it's only because I really, really like you. Really!",8,8
mona,"Okay, I guess you can-close the door now.",8,8
rachel,"Forgot my purse!  Oh, you guys made up.  He's a good kisser isn't he?  I'm going!",8,8
monica,I swear I didn't know she was a hooker! I mean who-Did you let her smoke in here?,8,8
chandler,"Her ass print is still on your grandmother's quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?",8,8
monica,"You know what? I'm going to make this up to you. I promised you a stripper , and you are going to get a stripper.",8,8
chandler,Monica! Wait!,8,8
monica,What?,8,8
chandler,Carry on.,8,8
monica,"Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I'll take them off.",8,8
chandler,Could you not narrate?,8,8
monica,Gotcha sailor.,8,8
dr. green,-just because you are not in love with the guy you can't-,8,8
phoebe,"Wow, you told your dad the truth.",8,8
rachel,About an hour ago.,8,8
phoebe,want to go see a movie?,8,8
rachel,Yes!  Bye daddy.,8,8
dr. green,-there's going to be a wedding!  that is unacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more important things in a marriage other than love!  -constantly thinking about things! You have to think about the consequences of your decision.,8,8
joey,Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!  What gives you the right to-  Go to hell!  Stupid guy on my phone.,8,8
joey,"Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.",8,9
rachel,Oh my-God! Let me see that!,8,9
joey,You fall for it every time!,8,9
phoebe,Hey!,8,9
rachel,Hi!,8,9
phoebe,I brought you my old maternity clothes!,8,9
rachel,"Oh Pheebs that is so sweet--Ooh, those are so cute!",8,9
phoebe,"Yeah! And look,  see how they expand as the baby grows?  And then after the baby's born, they're great for shoplifting melons.",8,9
monica,"Oh good you are all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o'clock.  Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?",8,9
rachel,No.,8,9
monica,"He was in Ross's class-marching band-kind of overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.",8,9
rachel,"Wow! I don't remember him. Honey, are you sure you are not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.",8,9
monica,"No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven't thought about him in a long time-   Anyway, umm Will's, Will's here on business and he didn't have a place to go so I invited him here.",8,9
rachel,Oh that is nice.,8,9
monica,"Oh, and by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous!  I still love Chandler.",8,9
joey,I just want you to say it once in a while.,8,9
monica,"All right okay, just so you know, I'm not going to make a turkey this year.",8,9
joey,What?!,8,9
monica,Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey-,8,9
joey,Phoebe!,8,9
phoebe,"Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals!",8,9
joey,No they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!,8,9
monica,"All right! Okay, it's just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet, Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.",8,9
joey,She is?,8,9
rachel,Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?,8,9
joey,Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.,8,9
monica,"Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.",8,9
joey,"But you got to have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!",8,9
monica,All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just-there's going to be a ton left over.,8,9
joey,No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!,8,9
monica,"All right, you are telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?",8,9
joey,"that is right! Because I'm a Tribbiani!  And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!",8,9
monica,"Hey, isn't weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table?   Rachel's! But good to know where you are at!",8,9
phoebe,Hey!,8,9
monica,Hey!,8,9
phoebe,Happy Thanksgiving!,8,9
monica,You too!,8,9
phoebe,Anything I can do to help?,8,9
monica,"Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game so I don't want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?",8,9
phoebe,Sure!,8,9
monica,I'm going to go across the hall to check on the yams.,8,9
phoebe,Okay.,8,9
monica,"No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We're not at a barn dance. You've got to-you want to fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?",8,9
phoebe,"Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me.   So how's the game?",8,9
chandler,I have no idea.,8,9
phoebe,What?,8,9
chandler,Yeah! I'm just pretending to watch the game so I don't have to help out with stuff.,8,9
phoebe,I don't believe you! That is-brilliant! And Monica has no idea?,8,9
chandler,Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.,8,9
monica,Is your team winning hon?,8,9
chandler,Yeah! Anderson just scored again!  There's no Anderson.,8,9
phoebe,"Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don't think I can help you after all, I didn't realize this game was on.",8,9
monica,"Oh, I didn't know you liked football.",8,9
phoebe,"Well normally I don't, but you know--Green Bay is playing.",8,9
monica,You like Green Bay?,8,9
phoebe,"Well it's only like my favourite bay! {Actually, it's not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }",8,9
monica,Hey!,8,9
will,Hey!,8,9
will,Happy Thanksgiving!,8,9
monica,Aww thanks! God Will I'm so glad that you came! You look great! You must've lost like-,8,9
will,"150 pounds. Yeah, I'm going to be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.",8,9
monica,A pie!,8,9
will,"Oh right. All right, it's no fat, it's no sugar, it's no dairy-it's no good. Throw it out.",8,9
monica,"You want to meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.",8,9
will,Hey.,8,9
chandler,"Oh hey. I'd shake your hand but uh; I'm really into the game. Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand right next to each other.",8,9
monica,This is Phoebe.,8,9
phoebe,Hey.  Wow!  Well done.,8,9
monica,want to give me a hand?,8,9
will,"Sure! Monica, I can't get over how great you look! You look stunning!",8,9
monica,Well you look incredible too! you are just-you are so fit!,8,9

will,Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!,8,9
monica,Good. And Rachel Green too.,8,9
will,Oh.,8,9
monica,Is there a problem?,8,9
will,"Nope. Uh, it's okay. It's just uh, God I hated her.",8,9
monica,What?,8,9
will,"Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, I'm in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something?  No Will no!",8,9
chandler,"You know, it's been a while since we've screamed something. Maybe we should.",8,9
phoebe,Oh okay.,8,9
chandler,Oh come on!,8,9
phoebe,No!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!,8,9
monica,"Hey, what are you doing? You got to save room, you've got almost an entire turkey to eat.",8,9
joey,Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eating' chips is like stretching.,8,9
monica,All right.,8,9
joey,"Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.",8,9
will,"I actually know what you are talking about. I'm here to tell you something my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void.",8,9
joey,Who the hell is this guy?,8,9
monica,Will! From high school.,8,9

ross,"Oh! Man I don't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party.",8,9

ross,"Yeah. It would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.",8,9
will,Yeah.,8,9
ross,Yeah.,8,9

rachel,"Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on.  Oh my God, he's- Look at the way he's just staring at me. I think he's trying to mouth something to me, but I can't make it out.",8,9

monica,"Oh, so who won?",8,9
phoebe,Green Bay.,8,9

rachel,"Hi! Will, right?",8,9
will,Right.,8,9
rachel,Hi! I'm Rachel Green.,8,9
will,Oh I-I remember you.,8,9
rachel,"Really?! Aren't you sweet! I got to tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis' graduation party?",8,9
will,You are unbelievable.,8,9
rachel,Thank you!,8,9
monica,"Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don't you sit here?  And Will you sit way over there.",8,9
joey,that is it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!,8,9
monica,This is Chandler's chicken. This is the turkey.,8,9
joey,Oh. How-how big is that?,8,9
monica,About nineteen pounds.,8,9
joey,It's like me when I was born.,8,9
rachel,"All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?",8,9
will,"Oh, you'd like that wouldn't you?",8,9
rachel,What?  OH you know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!,8,9
will,Typical.,8,9
rachel,I'm sorry. What?,8,9
will,"I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land.",8,9
joey,"Seriously, who is this guy?",8,9
rachel,"Umm, I'm sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?",8,9
will,I don't know? Do I? Do I?,8,9
phoebe,I think you do.,8,9
monica,"Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.",8,9
will,A little mean? You made my life miserable!,8,9
rachel,I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I-,8,9
will,Well you should be. Screw it! Bring on the yams!,8,9
monica,Oh Will. But you-you've worked so hard-,8,9
will,Yams!!!!,8,9
monica,Okay.,8,9
rachel,"Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I'm real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school-",8,9
will,"Oh, it wasn't just me. We had a club!",8,9
rachel,You had a club?!,8,9
will,"that is right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!",8,9
rachel,"Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?",8,9
will,Me and Ross.,8,9
ross,"No need to point, she knows who Ross is.",8,9
rachel,So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?,8,9
will,Yes he was.,8,9
ross,No. No.,8,9
rachel,So who else was in this club?,8,9
ross,"Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don't think he-he knew what it was.",8,9
rachel,"So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.",8,9
will,You went out with her?! We had a pact!,8,9
ross,That was in high school! It's not like it was binding forever.,8,9
will,Then why did it have the word eternity in it?,8,9
rachel,"Okay Monica, did you know about this?!",8,9
monica,I swear I didn't.  Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?,8,9
ross and will,Yeah.,8,9
monica,"Hmm, a little relieved, I got to say.",8,9
ross,"Look Rach I-I'm sorry, okay? I-I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined-",8,9
will,Co-founded!,8,9
ross,-co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn't handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.,8,9
will,"Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.",8,9
rachel,Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?,8,9
will,"Well, we did a little more than that.",8,9
ross,No-no! No-no. No-no.,8,9
phoebe,What?! What else did you do?,8,9
will,We started a rumour.,8,9
rachel,What rumour?,8,9
phoebe,"Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!",8,9
rachel,Ross!,8,9
ross,It was no big deal. We-we-said that the rumour was-that umm-you had both-male and female reproductive parts.,8,9
rachel,What?!,8,9
will,"that is right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.",8,9
rachel,Oh my God!,8,9
monica,You started that?!,8,9
rachel,What?! You heard that?!,8,9
monica,Everyone at our school heard it!,8,9
chandler,Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!,8,9
rachel,Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!,8,9
ross,"Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one's not really our fault.",8,9
rachel,"Monica, how come you never told me this?!",8,9
monica,I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were going to cry and then show it to me.,8,9
rachel,Joey stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!,8,9
joey,I'm afraid I'm going to need proof.,8,9
rachel,Oh!,8,9
joey,You are my Everest.,8,9
monica,"Joey, you don't have to finish that.",8,9
joey,"Oh yes I do. Otherwise what's next? Today I'm just a guy who can't finish a turkey, but tomorrow I'm the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just-I just-I got to change my pants.  Jeans have no give.",8,9
rachel,"Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, ""Dear Rach, you are such a good person."" Not girl! Person!",8,9
ross,"Rach, I think you are reading a little too much into it.",8,9
rachel,"""Dear Rach, you are a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie.""",8,9
ross,"Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn't true?!",8,9
rachel,Yes!,8,9
will,Could you also tell them I'm skinny now?,8,9
monica,Oh! Me too!,8,9
ross,Well look-look I'm not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!,8,9
rachel,I don't care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! You know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.,8,9
monica,that is not totally true.,8,9
rachel,What?,8,9
ross,What?,8,9
monica,"Well you-you did start that rumour about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.",8,9
ross,How did you know that?!!!!,8,9
monica,It's true?!!,8,9
ross,No.,8,9
rachel,Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalogue!,8,9
will,Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.,8,9
chandler,I'm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?,8,9
ross,Hey! She didn't look 50!,8,9
chandler,Did she look 16?,8,9
rachel,"OH, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.",8,9
phoebe,Oh!  Wow!,8,9
ross,She didn't photograph well!,8,9
chandler,"Well, she probably wasn't familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!",8,9
phoebe,"So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?",8,9
ross,"I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace-",8,9
monica,Didn't she walk with a cane?,8,9
ross,Only when it was damp!!  I can't believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?!you know what?  I'm back in the club!,8,9
will,Yeah!,8,9
phoebe,I want to join!,8,9
rachel,Wh-Phoebe!!,8,9
phoebe,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn't go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.",8,9
rachel,"All right, you know-Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie!",8,9
monica,"All right, listen you are just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumour you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!",8,9
rachel,Wow-,8,9
monica,"And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumour I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!",8,9
ross,As a romancer of the elderly.,8,9
monica,Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.,8,9
ross,The eyes-did still sparkle.,8,9
monica,Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you've been through so much since then. And right now you've got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can't you just let this go?,8,9
rachel,She's right.,8,9
ross,Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.,8,9
will,Hold on! You got her pregnant?,8,9
ross,Yeah.,8,9
will,Are you getting married?,8,9
ross,Nope.,8,9
will,So you knocked her up but you are not going to marry her. Dude!  Anybody?,8,9
phoebe,Okay.  It's exactly how I'd imagined it would be.,8,9
joey,All right where's that turkey!,8,9
phoebe,Joey! Those are my maternity pants!,8,9
joey,Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!,8,9
joey,Well that is it. I'm done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.,8,9
monica,"Well Joey, we're all-we're all very proud of you.",8,9
chandler,"Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.",8,9
phoebe,Is there anything we can do for you?,8,9
joey,"No just, nobody press on my stomach.",8,9
rachel,You can keep those pants by the way.,8,9
joey,Whoa-hey-who-who-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?,8,9
monica,"Yeah, you want some?",8,9
joey,"Ah, just cut me a little sliver.  A little bigger.  Little bigger.  What?! Are you afraid you are going to run out?! Cut me a real piece!",8,9
monica,Hey! So what do you think?,8,10
chandler,New haircut?  Necklace?  Dress?  Boots?  Boots!,8,10
monica,"Yes! Now, they're a little more than I normally spend on boots 'or rent",8,10
chandler,Oh my God!,8,10
monica,I know.,8,10
chandler,I'm going to miss being able to afford food.,8,10
monica,"I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, ""Oh, these are way too expensive for you.""",8,10
chandler,She had a point.,8,10
rachel,Hi!,8,10
monica,Hey.,8,10
rachel,Oh my God!  Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!,8,10
monica,They're mine!,8,10
chandler,"Yeah well, too bad we're going to have to return them.",8,10
rachel,Return them?! Shh! They're going to hear you!,8,10
monica,"Honey, I'm not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time. You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?",8,10
chandler,I have you.,8,10
monica,Nice try; I'm keeping the boots.,8,10
ross,"that is right, I love you! And-and I'm going to play with you all the time.",8,10
phoebe,How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?,8,10
rachel,He's talking to the baby.,8,10
phoebe,"OH! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, ""I can't wait to hear your first words,"" I thought, ""There's a trick.""",8,10
rachel,"Okay. Well, I got to go you guys. I'll see you later.",8,10
phoebe,Okay.,8,10
ross,Bye.,8,10
rachel,Bye.,8,10
joey,"Oh hey Rach, listen-Hi!",8,10
rachel,Hi.,8,10
joey,"Umm, can you do me a favour? I was talking' to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren'",8,10
rachel,"No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.",8,10
joey,"No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she's really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, you know, to give her some advice.",8,10
rachel,I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors',8,10
joey,"Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!",8,10
rachel,Really?! Oh my God! I'm successful!,8,10
joey,"Okay, so will you meet with her?",8,10
rachel,Yes! I'd love to! Have her come by the office.,8,10
joey,"Great! Thanks! you are going to love her so much. And-Oh, she's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, you know the S.A.T's?",8,10
rachel,Yeah.,8,10
joey,She took them!,8,10
phoebe,Hey Ross! Doesn't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?,8,10
ross,Yeah. Why?,8,10
phoebe,Sting has a son that goes there too!,8,10
ross,Yeah I know; he's in Ben's class.,8,10
phoebe,You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!,8,10
ross,Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?,8,10
phoebe,"Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture.",8,10
ross,What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?,8,10
phoebe,"No, it's New York magazine. It's an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?",8,10
ross,"Uh, I actually haven't even met him.",8,10
phoebe,"Uh-huh, yeah that is too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you.",8,10
ross,"Well actually, I'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there.",8,10
phoebe,"There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! that is why you have kids!",8,10
monica,Hey guys!,8,10

rachel,Hi Monica!,8,10
monica,Hey.,8,10
rachel,Hi boots.,8,10
monica,"See Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out of them already! They're very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants'",8,10
chandler,You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.,8,10
phoebe,Wow! They're beautiful!,8,10
rachel,Ahh',8,10
monica,They hurt so much!,8,10
phoebe,What?!,8,10
monica,The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!,8,10
rachel,Well-well you can give them to me! I haven't felt my feet in years!,8,10
monica,"I can't! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I just can't give them away!",8,10
phoebe,Well then get your money back and return them!,8,10
monica,I can't do that either! The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.,8,10
ross,Hey!,8,10
chandler,Hey!,8,10
ross,Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school',8,10
chandler,I don't think you did a very thorough job!,8,10

phoebe,Oh no! Why not?,8,10
ross,Well it turns out that Ben and Sting's son do not get along.,8,10
phoebe,How come?!,8,10
ross,"Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that Ben's moms are lesbinims.",8,10
phoebe,Wait! But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.,8,10
ross,"Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends.",8,10
phoebe,"Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!",8,10
ross,Playpen?! Ben's seven!,8,10
phoebe,Your kid is seven?!   He's really small.  Please! Please get the tickets!,8,10

rachel,"Okay. All right Dina, well let's talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let's see, there's design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there's-there's sales, which is great because you get to travel'",8,10
dina,"I'I don't care about fashion! I'm pregnant! And I know you are too, so you got to help me!",8,10
rachel,And there's marketing',8,10
monica,Ah!,8,10
chandler,What's wrong?,8,10
monica,Oh nothing I'm just-just was yawning.,8,10
chandler,"Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight.",8,10
monica,"Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?",8,10
chandler,"Now sweetie, I know you don't like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a'supple leather lining.",8,10
monica,I-I don't-I don't think that I'm going to wear the boots tonight.,8,10
chandler,Why not?,8,10
monica,"Well you know, I'm just-I'm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!",8,10
chandler,Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?,8,10
monica,"Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it.",8,10
chandler,"You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!",8,10
monica,"Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots. In fact, I'll go into my room right now and you know try the outfit on.",8,10
chandler,Okay.,8,10
monica,Okay?  Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots!,8,10
dina,I-I can't go in there. I can't tell him!,8,10
rachel,"Honey, it's going to be okay. He's been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that is what the meatball sub is for.",8,10
dina,Thank you.,8,10
rachel,Okay.,8,10
joey,Hey! It's my fashion girls!  What's wrong?,8,10
rachel,"Honey, why don't you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.",8,10
joey,"Oh. What's, what's going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad's heart? Is that a sandwich?",8,10
dina,"Joe, mom and dad are fine'",8,10
joey,Is that a sandwich?!,8,10
rachel,Joey 'there's something that you 'should know. Dina?,8,10
dina,I'm pregnant.,8,10
joey,What?!,8,10
rachel,Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!,8,10
joey,Well obviously this is a mistake! You can't be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!,8,10
dina,"Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!",8,10
rachel,What?! Dina',8,10
joey,Bub!!!   I can't believe this! you are the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!,8,10
dina,"Bobby Corso, but he's a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He's real funny.",8,10
joey,"You got pregnant for funny?! Dina, if he's funny, laugh! All right, I'll be back in a little while! You stay here!",8,10
dina,Why? Where are you going?,8,10
joey,I can't look at you right now!,8,10
dina,Wow.,8,10
rachel,I know.,8,10
phoebe,"Oh, there you are Ben!",8,10
ben,"Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?",8,10
phoebe,"Well, I heard you are having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son.",8,10
ben,Jack? I hate him! He's a jerk.,8,10
phoebe,"Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.",8,10
ben,I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there.,8,10
phoebe,Him you are friends with.,8,10
the teacher,"Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?",8,10
phoebe,"Yes! Yes you can, I'm looking for Jack's parents.",8,10
the teacher,Are you with one of the students?,8,10
phoebe,"Uh-huh, I'm with Ben.",8,10
the teacher,Are you one of Ben's mothers?,8,10
phoebe,"I am one of Ben's mothers. I'm a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.",8,10
the teacher,"Well hi, I'm Jenny Boone. I'm the new teacher here.",8,10
phoebe,Oh.,8,10
the teacher,I've only met your partner Carol.,8,10
phoebe,Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.,8,10
the teacher,Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents to discuss the problems he's having with Ben?  Yeah. Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.,8,10
phoebe,"Yeah! Let's do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?",8,10
the teacher,"Oh, their number is on the contact sheet.",8,10
phoebe,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? Because Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.",8,10
chandler,"You know, that party wasn't bad.",8,10
monica,Yeah! I didn't know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!,8,10
chandler,"I don't see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?",8,10
monica,"Oh no, we can't walk!",8,10
chandler,"What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let's go.",8,10
monica,Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?,8,10
chandler,What's going on?,8,10
monica,I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!,8,10
chandler,What?,8,10
monica,"Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They're killing me! One toe at a time!",8,10
chandler,So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.  It's oddly unsettling.,8,10
monica,How are we going to get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?,8,10
chandler,Hop on.,8,10
monica,"Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first.  Ah Ooh Ooh Ooh Oh God Oh Oh Oh oh'",8,10
chandler,"Honey, I know you are in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on.",8,10
dina,Do you ever worry that you'll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?,8,10
rachel,What college was that Dina?,8,10
dina,Oh my God! Bobby!,8,10
bobby,Hi Dina. Good to see you.,8,10
rachel,"Joey, what are you doing?",8,10
joey,"Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman'",8,10
rachel,Oh Joey this is crazy!,8,10
joey,"Don't interrupt me when I'm talking' to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man'",8,10
dina,No!,8,10
joey,Oh you'll take them!,8,10
dina,No I won't!,8,10
joey,Hey! You don't get a say in this!,8,10
dina,Yes I do!,8,10
joey,"Ah! I heard ""I do"", we're halfway there! Okay!  You!",8,10
rachel,"All right Joey! That is enough!  Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it's not legal. Okay? They-they don't have a marriage license, they don't have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!",8,10
bobby,"Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.",8,10
joey,Well what am I supposed to do?,8,10
rachel,you are supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.,8,10
joey,No they can't! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!,8,10
rachel,Hey! Contraceptives are not always effective!  Right?,8,10
bobby,Yeah we kind of didn't use any',8,10
rachel,"Oh, come on kids! A little help here!",8,10
phoebe,Wow! This place is incredible!  Sting's pen that he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway!,8,10
trudie styler,Hi!,8,10
phoebe,Hi!,8,10
trudie styler,I'm Trudie.,8,10
phoebe,Uh-huh.,8,10
trudie styler,You must be Ben's mum.,8,10
phoebe,Why else would I be here?,8,10
trudie styler,Do sit down.,8,10
phoebe,Uh-huh.,8,10
trudie styler,I gather Jack and Ben haven't been getting along lately.,8,10
phoebe,Yeah.,8,10
trudie styler,"I'm told there are two sides to this story, but all I've heard is that Ben's a bit of a poo-poo head.",8,10
phoebe,"Umm, I'm sorry. Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us?",8,10
trudie styler,"Oh I'm sorry, Jack's father is not available.",8,10
phoebe,"Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?",8,10
trudie styler,"Oh no, I know that wouldn't work. My husband's in concert.",8,10
phoebe,"Concert. Yeah. That does put us in quite a pickle. Because you see I'm very busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during.",8,10
trudie styler,"So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.",8,10
phoebe,"Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.",8,10
trudie styler,Are you here for tickets?,8,10
phoebe,"Oh, thank you. Four would be great.",8,10
trudie styler,I'm not giving concert tickets to someone who'd use their son like this!,8,10
phoebe,Oh good! Then you are in luck! Ben's not my son!,8,10
trudie styler,"Look, I've just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!",8,10
phoebe,The Police? Here? A reunion?!,8,10
chandler,"Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.",8,10
monica,Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!,8,10
chandler,Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?,8,10
monica,My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?,8,10
chandler,I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.,8,10
monica,"Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.",8,10
chandler,I don't have your boots.,8,10
monica,Well I don't have them either. Where are they?,8,10
chandler,"Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!",8,10
monica,"Okay.  God well, we got to go back and get them!",8,10
chandler,"Honey, are you seriously ever going to wear the boots again?",8,10
monica,"Okay, I am never going to wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.",8,10
chandler,You know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.,8,10
monica,Okay.  All right.,8,10
chandler,Okay.,8,10
monica,Bye boots-Wait! Half off?!,8,10
rachel,"Joey, just because they're not getting married doesn't mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!",8,10
joey,"Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?",8,10
bobby,Well I really have high hopes for my band.,8,10
joey,You were right. He is funny.,8,10
rachel,"Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don't you tell us a little bit about your band?",8,10
bobby,"Well it's just me and my pal Rooster, the band's name is Numb Nuts.",8,10
rachel,Really?,8,10
joey,"Dina, if you are having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby!  Dude, that is not a compliment!",8,10
dina,No Joey! I knew you wouldn't be supportive!,8,10
joey,"So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you going to do? you are going to have the baby and-and raise it by yourself, without a husband?! You can't be a single mother alone! you are going to ruin your life!",8,10
rachel,Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?,8,10
joey,No! No! No! It's different for you. you are so strong and together. you are not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.,8,10
dina,Excuse me?,8,10
joey,"One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.",8,10
rachel,So forcing her to marry Bobby is going to make that happen?,8,10
joey,"Maybe!  Well! Well, so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can't!",8,10
dina,"Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it, I'm just going to need some help. And Bobby's going to be here the whole time.",8,10
bobby,"You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, we're straight-up gangster rap.",8,10
dina,"Look, Rachel's told me how much easier you've made all this on her. Why can't you do that for me?",8,10
joey,"Because! Because, because you are my baby sister!",8,10
dina,"And you are my big brother! I mean, you are my favourite guy in the whole world. I'm not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you.",8,10
joey,"Well I'd be scared of them, but all right.",8,10
dina,"Joey, I can't stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby going to have his Uncle Joey?",8,10
joey,Of course he's going to have his Uncle Joey!,8,10
dina,"We're going to be all right. I mean, even if we're not married this baby is going to be so loved. Not just by us.",8,10
joey,that is right! By his uncle too!,8,10
bobby,And by you.,8,10
rachel,"Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment.",8,10
joey,Come here!,8,10
rachel,No! Seriously! What's wrong with you?!,8,10
ross,you are going to love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!,8,10
phoebe,Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!,8,10
ross,"Well, let's just say Ross can!",8,10
phoebe,"Oo, where are the seats?",8,10
ross,"Uh, middle balcony.",8,10
phoebe,"Okay, now would you say that that is more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?",8,10
ross,Yeah.,8,10
phoebe,Then that is not breaking the law! I'm there!,8,10
rachel,Phoebe?,8,11
phoebe,Yeah?,8,11
rachel,"Look at that guy by the window, wow!",8,11
phoebe,"He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to  be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.",8,11
rachel,"Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it's like every guy I  see-I mean look here.  Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that is not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the  way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.",8,11
phoebe,"Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?",8,11
rachel,Yeah.,8,11
phoebe,"This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start  going crazy.",8,11
rachel,Really?! So this has happened to you?,8,11
phoebe,"Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so  in, you know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.",8,11
rachel,"Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store  sitting on Santa's lap.",8,11
phoebe,"Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cut-out of Evander  Holyfield from a Foot Locker.",8,11
rachel,Ah.,8,11
phoebe,Yeah.,8,11
rachel,"Well, you know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask her  about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.",8,11
phoebe,"Yeah. Yeah, that is what you need a good-pill.",8,11
mona,Hey!  Hey!,8,11
ross,Hi!,8,11
mona,Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Centre.,8,11
ross,"Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona  ice skating?",8,11
joey,"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.",8,11
ross,Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us  together?,8,11
mona,"Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took  pictures of my breasts!",8,11
joey,I'm missing' picture time?!,8,11
phoebe,You know she has a face Ross!,8,11
mona,"Okay. Okay, here's a good one of us.",8,11
ross,"Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card you know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.",8,11
mona,"You know, every year I say I'm going to send out holiday cards and I  never do it. Do you want to, do you want to send this one out together?",8,11
ross,Together? Like-like to people?,8,11
mona,"Yeah, you know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It'll be cute,  okay?",8,11
ross,Okay.,8,11
mona,"Oh, I got to get to work. So call me later?",8,11
ross,"Uh sure, sure.",8,11
mona,Bye guys.,8,11
phoebe,Bye.,8,11
joey,Congratulations! You just got married!,8,11
ross,I know. Can you believe that?,8,11
phoebe,"Wait, I'm-I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday  card?",8,11
ross,"Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have  been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!",8,11
joey,"Hey-hey-hey, hey that is your wife you are talking about!",8,11
doug,Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!,8,11
chandler,"Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?",8,11
monica,"Yes, hi.",8,11
doug,"Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.",8,11
chandler,"I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm  sorry.",8,11
doug,"Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations  to you guys though!",8,11
monica,No leg-chewing for us sir.,8,11
doug,"Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we've got a lot  to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?",8,11
monica,I can't think of anything we're doing.  Why  can't I think of anything we're doing?,8,11
doug,"Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep  throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!",8,11
monica,"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow!  Just so you know,  we're not seeing him tomorrow.  I-I cannot spend another  evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?",8,11
chandler,No.,8,11
monica,that is because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved  at our engagement party.,8,11
chandler,"Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture  doesn't it?",8,11
mona,Hi!,8,11
ross,Hey!,8,11
mona,"Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mock-up of our card.  What do you think?",8,11
ross,"Huh. Wow, this is great.",8,11
mona,"Now, do you think it should say, ""Love Ross and Mona?""",8,11
ross,"Well, we-we haven't said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay  to say it to other people.",8,11
mona,How many did you want? I'm getting a hundred.,8,11
ross,"A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I'll take a-Mona, uh-I-I'm  not sure about the whole uh, card thing.",8,11
mona,Really? Why not?,8,11
ross,"Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don't know if  we're really quite there yet.",8,11
mona,"OH you know, I didn't think of it that way. you are right.  you are right. So, can I ask you a question?",8,11
ross,Yeah.,8,11
mona,Where are we?,8,11
ross,Huh.,8,11
mona,"You know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?",8,11
ross,Hmm-,8,11
mona,"I mean I love spending time with you, you know I just-I hope  we're moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don't you  think?",8,11
ross,Let's do the card!,8,11
mona,What?,8,11
ross,The card! I think we're there!,8,11
mona,Okay. I-But I think we should still have this conversation.,8,11
ross,"Really?! I mean, even with the card?",8,11
nurse,Hi!,8,11
rachel,Hi!,8,11
nurse,"Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here today, she was called to  the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.",8,11
rachel,"Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy  who took my blood sample really cute? You know who I'm talking about, bald  haircut, hairy fingers-",8,11
dr. schiff,Hi Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.,8,11
rachel,"Yes, you are.",8,11
dr. schiff,"So, how's it going?",8,11
rachel,"Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are  you from? What do you do?",8,11
dr. schiff,I'm a doctor.,8,11
rachel,"Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you  ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?",8,11
dr. schiff,"Uh, I don't have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.",8,11
rachel,"Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!",8,11
dr. schiff,"So, are you experiencing any discomfort?",8,11
rachel,No. I'm very comfortable.,8,11
dr. schiff,Any painful gas?,8,11
rachel,"No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!",8,11
dr. schiff,"Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?",8,11
rachel,Well would you like me to lie down on the table?,8,11
dr. schiff,"I'm sorry, is there something going on here?",8,11
rachel,Do you feel it too?,8,11
rachel,Hi.,8,11
phoebe,"Oh hey! So, how did your doctor's appointment go?",8,11
rachel,"Well, let's see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the  middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.",8,11
phoebe,Oh my God.,8,11
monica,Why did you do that?,8,11
phoebe,"Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my  fourth month of  pregnancy?",8,11
monica,"Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you  practically came on to me.",8,11
phoebe,You wish.,8,11
monica,"Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.",8,11
phoebe,Oh yeah? Come and get it.,8,11
rachel,"Okay, even this is turning me on!",8,11
ross,Hey!,8,11
rachel,"Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how's it, how's it going with you and  Mona? Are you guys still together?",8,11
ross,"Oh yeah, yeah we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card!",8,11
monica,You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?,8,11
ross,"Yeah, we're not just doing a card! You know, she-she also wants to  have the conversation about where the relationship is going.",8,11
phoebe,Ugh! Women!,8,11
ross,"I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I  mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, ""So, where is this going?""",8,11
rachel,Uh Ross? You asked me that.,8,11
ross,"Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I'm not a mind reader! Besides, I  hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a  gesture. You know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk  about it.",8,11
monica,Like asking her to move in with you?,8,11
ross,Smaller than that.,8,11
monica,Making her a mixed tape?,8,11
ross,"Uh, bigger than that.",8,11
phoebe,Give her a key to your apartment.,8,11
ross,Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.,8,11
monica,"All right. Have you said, ""I love you?"" You could say, I love  you.",8,11
ross,"Yeah I-I don't-I don't think I'm quite there yet, but I  could say I love spending time with you.",8,11
phoebe,"No, we hate that.",8,11
monica,That is a slap in the face.,8,11
ross,"Forget it. I-I-You know what? I'll just have the  conversation. I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.  What do you think Rach?",8,11
rachel,"I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples  through that sweater.",8,11
doug,"Bing! We're all set for tonight, 8 o'clock.",8,11
chandler,"Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.",8,11
doug,"Oh, my ex-wife didn't work, unless you call turning into her mother  work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.",8,11
chandler,Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.,8,11
doug,Oh? Why not?,8,11
chandler,It's the semi-finals-of her-botchy ball tournament.,8,11
doug,"What's going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or  something?",8,11
chandler,Well now-now you are just talking crazy.,8,11
doug,So why can't the three of us go out together?,8,11
chandler,Because uh-we-we-we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold  me.,8,11
doug,"Good God Bing I-well I can't say I'm altogether surprised,  I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at  me, pure lust.",8,11
chandler,You know what would really help me through this tough time is  choking something. Can I choke you?,8,11
doug,"Bing my boy, we're going to get you over this. Now here's the plan,  grab your coat, we're going to a strip club.",8,11
chandler,"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with  that bitch.",8,11
ross,"Here we go. Mona umm, I think it's time we-we had a conversation  about-about where things are with us.",8,11
mona,"Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.",8,11
ross,"Aw, we-we are so- So umm, well  I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, you know hanging out with you. And I mean-I'm  having a lot of fun.",8,11
mona,Okay.,8,11
ross,"I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if  it's just fun. It's got to be, it's got to be going somewhere right? So  where-where is it going?  Ah! that is-that is the real question. And-and  the answer is-is it's going somewhere-fun. Now I-I know what you are  thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago you know, but you are-you are  not getting any younger. No I mean-No not you, not you, you-you are  getting younger. I mean-you-you look like you are getting younger by the  second-What's your secret?",8,11
mona,"I'm sorry, so umm, so where are we?",8,11
ross,"Well, well to sum up, we're having fun, you look young.",8,11
mona,Okay-,8,11
ross,But that is not enough. So- So-here's a key to my  apartment.,8,11
mona,Really?!,8,11
ross,Really.,8,11
mona,You don't think this is too fast.,8,11
rachel,You gave her a key to your apartment?!,8,11
ross,"Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a  very serious relationship.",8,11
phoebe,Hey. Ooh Ross! How'd the conversation go?,8,11
ross,"Oh great, I live on the street.",8,11
phoebe,Where?!,8,11
rachel,Hey!,8,11
phoebe,"Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.",8,11
roger,Hey everybody.,8,11
monica,Hi Roger.,8,11
phoebe,"So umm, I'm going to get us some drinks.  Would you help me  out?",8,11
rachel,Yeah.,8,11
phoebe,"Umm, he's here to have sex with you.",8,11
rachel,What?,8,11
phoebe,you are welcome.,8,11
rachel,Phoebe no!,8,11
phoebe,"It's okay, he's a virgin.",8,11
monica,"Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he'll have  sex with you.",8,11
phoebe,"Yeah, okay let's leave these two alone.",8,11
rachel,"No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do  it with some random guy!",8,11
phoebe,Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!,8,11
doug,"Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap  dance with those girls. Huh?",8,11
chandler,"Oh that is all right sir, and that is just one girl.",8,11
doug,Bing-What's this?!,8,11
chandler,It's a hand. It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke  holder.,8,11
doug,"No, it's a wedding ring. You got to get rid of it. We're going to go  to the East River right now and throw it in there!",8,11
chandler,Oh no-no-no!,8,11
doug,"Oh yeah-yeah-yeah ,you know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better  and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.",8,11
ross,"Okay, and oh I'm going to need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give  them away for no reason at all.",8,11
mona,"Hey Ross, what's going on? You changing the lock?",8,11
ross,No. That guy is.,8,11
mona,I don't understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then  you change the lock.,8,11
locksmith,Good luck buddy.,8,11
mona,"Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you are-you are  sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?",8,11
ross,I'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.,8,11
mona,What?,8,11
ross,I love you!,8,11
mona,OH!  And I love spending time with you.,8,11
chandler,Hi honey I'm home.,8,11
monica,From the tequila factory?,8,11
chandler,"It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that  you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then  when I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!",8,11
monica,Come here. I can breath through my mouth.,8,11
chandler,"You know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would  be like without you. It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please  promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each  other for the rest of our lives.",8,11
monica,"I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday  card this year?",8,11
chandler,"Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.",8,11
rachel,"Yes. Hi, I'd like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question?  Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch.  I'll call you back.",8,11
joey,Who was that?,8,11
rachel,It's just the pizza place.,8,11
joey,You hung up on the pizza place? I don't hang up on your friends.,8,11
rachel,"I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day.",8,11
joey,"Oh, what's wrong?",8,11
rachel,"Oh you really, you really just don't want to hear about it.",8,11
joey,Then why did I ask?,8,11
rachel,"Okay, it's just-and this is really embarrassing-but  lately with this whole pregnancy thing I'm just finding myself-how do I put this  umm, erotically charged.",8,11
joey,Is that college talk for horny?,8,11
rachel,"Yeah. So you know, I have all of these feelings and I don't know  what to do about them, because I can't date like a normal person, which is fine  because I don't need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night.  Just sex, you know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel  comfortable with and who knows what he's doing. For just one great night, I mean is  that really so-hard-to find.  So how was your day?",8,11
joey,"Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.",8,11
rachel,"Well, I got to get up early and it's almost seven o'clock.",8,11
joey,"Yeah, I got to, I got to go to my room too.",8,11
rachel,"Okay, good night!",8,11
joey,Good night.,8,11
joey,I can't do it!,8,11
rachel,I didn't ask you to do it!,8,11
joey,you are Rachel!,8,11
rachel,you are Joey!,8,11
joey,you are my friend!,8,11
rachel,Right back at you!,8,11
joey,"But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.",8,11
rachel,And so bad. I don't even know what you are talking about  because I didn't ask you to do anything!,8,11
joey,I know!,8,11
joey,Do you want to do it?,8,11
rachel,No!,8,11
joey,"All right, me neither! I was just testing you!",8,11
rachel,that is the end of this conversation!,8,11
joey,This conversation never happened!,8,11
rachel,Never happened! Good night!,8,11
joey,Good night!,8,11
joey,Get back in there!,8,11
phoebe,"Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really  wasn't right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something  that I think you'll really enjoy.  Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I'm going to, I'm going to  want him back. So-  I'm going to go now.     I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can't!",8,11
phoebe,Hey! I got you a present!!,8,12
chandler,Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?,8,12
phoebe,"I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got  here!",8,12
chandler,Pheebs you didn't have to get us anything for our wedding you  already sang,8,12
monica,I love it! It's huge!! Let's open it! Open it!!,8,12
phoebe,It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!,8,12
monica,Oh my God!,8,12
phoebe,I didn't know where to put it so I just left it here for now.,8,12
monica,"Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.",8,12
chandler,"Oh, okay.",8,12
monica,All right.,8,12
chandler,I kind of like it here.,8,12
phoebe,Do you really like it?,8,12
monica,"Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade!  This is like—Oh my, this is like my second favourite game!",8,12
phoebe,Oh really? What was your first?,8,12
monica,Well I-I really don't remember the name of it.,8,12
chandler,Well what did it do?,8,12
monica,"Well, you just—you put a quarter in and you know pull-pull some  handles and win like a candy bar or something.",8,12
chandler,A vending machine?,8,12
monica,Don't feel bad for me! I won like every time!,8,12
ross,"Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you guys are here. I've been dying to tell  someone what happened in the Palaeontology department today.",8,12
joey,Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?,8,12
ross,"Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so….",8,12
rachel,They made you head of the department!,8,12
ross,"No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didn't I  get head of the department?",8,12
joey,"Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm",8,12
rachel,Yeah.,8,12
joey,"I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?",8,12
rachel,"Uh, Paul's Cafe. They got great food and it's really  romantic.",8,12
joey,"Ooh, great! Thanks!",8,12
rachel,"Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons  for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing—Oh! Take her  dancing!",8,12
joey,"You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell you",8,12
rachel,"Ooh, I miss dating. Getting' all dressed up and going to a fancy  restaurant. I'm not going to be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun!  I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not  fun.",8,12
joey,"Hey, you know what?",8,12
rachel,Huh?,8,12
joey,Why don't I take you out?,8,12
rachel,"What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.",8,12
joey,"Yes I do! And we're going to go out, we're going to have a good time,  and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching  out",8,12
rachel,Okay! I'll go with you! I'll go! I'll go  with you.,8,12
joey,I'll be fun.,8,12
rachel,All right?,8,12
phoebe,"No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off  all of your top scores, how sad.",8,12
monica,"Okay, I'm next.  Don't!  Don't start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!",8,12
phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.",8,12
monica,Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!,8,12
chandler,Who cares? It's a stupid game.,8,12
monica,You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.,8,12
chandler,I don't suck. It's sucks. You suck.,8,12
phoebe,"Wait okay, if this game is going to cause problems between the two of you,  then maybe I should just keep it.",8,12
monica,"No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don't you  go home and wait for the thank you card?",8,12
chandler,Why do you want to play this game so bad?,8,12
phoebe,Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every  game.,8,12
monica,"Okay. Phoebe that is it. Come on, get out—out of the chair. Get  out!  Oh  come…Phoebe!",8,12
rachel,Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?,8,12
joey,"No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you.",8,12
rachel,"OH, Lilies. Joey, they're my favourite. Thank you.",8,12
joey,"And, a brownie!  Well, half a  brownie. Actually, it's just bag. It's been a long walk from the flower shop and  I was starting' to feel faint so",8,12
rachel,"Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I'm going on a real  date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that  goes up to about……there.",8,12
joey,"Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so…nice place you got here.  Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.",8,12
rachel,"Yeah, actually that is my roommate's.",8,12
joey,I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.,8,12
rachel,"Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch  yourself.",8,12
joey,"Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?",8,12
rachel,Hm-mmm.,8,12
joey,"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?",8,12
rachel,"Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.",8,12
joey,"No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come  on!",8,12
ross,"which brings us back, of course, to Greely's theory of dominance.   Okay, that-that is all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the  Freeman building is?",8,12
student,"Yeah, it's the new building on Avenue A.",8,12
ross,"What?! That-that is all the way cross town, I'm supposed to teach  a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.",8,12
student,"Ooh, dude. that is not going to happen.",8,12
ross,Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I'm the teacher!!,8,12
ross,"Hello.  I'm  sorry I'm a little late. Ah——Whoa! A lot late. Let me  start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller.  So to sum up,  I'm Professor Geller. Good job today.",8,12
rachel,"Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?",8,12
waitress,There's a side of steamed vegetables.,8,12
rachel,"Emm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute  the three-pound lobster?",8,12
joey,"You know what? Bring her both, and I'll have the same.",8,12
rachel,"Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh, I almost  forgot. I didn't pay you the rent check.",8,12
joey,"Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We're on a date.",8,12
rachel,Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do  you have any moves?,8,12
joey,"No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don't like me for—  I'm sorry I couldn't even get through that.",8,12
rachel,I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.,8,12
joey,"Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine  sent to my table from a fan.",8,12
rachel,Oh my God. And that works?!,8,12
joey,"Well it does when you combine it with, ""This is so embarrassing, I  just want to have a normal life!""",8,12
rachel,"Oh, you poor little famous man.",8,12
joey,"Oh okay, how about this one. I was going to wait until the end of the night  to kiss you, but you are so beautiful…I don't think I can.",8,12
rachel,"Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned  in. I really almost did!",8,12
joey,"Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves.",8,12
rachel,Alright. So where'd you grow up?,8,12
joey,"that is your move? Boy Rach, you are lucky you are hot.",8,12
rachel,"Come on, just answer the question!",8,12
joey,Queens.,8,12
rachel,And so were-were you close to your parents?,8,12
joey,"Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.",8,12
rachel,Why not?,8,12
joey,"I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance you know—I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.",8,12
rachel,Oh.  It's  got to be rough.,8,12
joey,"Yeah, it is. It's really tough. You know sometimes I  think—Wow!! Nice move!",8,12
rachel,Huh?,8,12
joey,"""Where'd you grow up,"" it's so simple!",8,12
rachel,"Thank you! And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the rest  room.",8,12
joey,Yeah.,8,12
rachel,And now you are watching me walk away.,8,12
joey,Yes I am! Again so simple!,8,12
monica,Hey.,8,12
chandler,You are not going to believe what I did today!,8,12
monica,Well it clearly wasn't showering or shaving.,8,12
chandler,I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They  should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler.  Although I-I hope they don't.,8,12
monica,"Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man  while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!",8,12
chandler,"Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the  board! High five!",8,12
monica,What is the matter with your hand?,8,12
chandler,"Well I've been playing it for like eight hours, it'll loosen  up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they're dirty  words.",8,12
monica,"Chandler, why would you do that?",8,12
chandler,Because it's awesome.,8,12
monica,You think this is clever?,8,12
chandler,"Well you know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it  is a bit of a challenge.",8,12
monica,"Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty.",8,12
chandler,It is when you put it together with that one.,8,12
monica,"Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one  of those from me. But Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this  can't be there.",8,12
chandler,"Come on, he won't even know what they mean.",8,12
monica,Chandler! He's seven; he's not stupid.,8,12
chandler,Have you talked to him lately?,8,12
monica,"All right, look I'm just going to unplug it.",8,12
chandler,"No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day!  It would be like I was at work.  No!  Hey look at  that! Look at that, it's still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM   Chip in it or something!",8,12
monica,Honey you-you got to beat your scores!,8,12
chandler,With the claw?!,8,12
monica,"All right fine. Fine, I'll do it. I've just got to get this  off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.",8,12
chandler,Pull my finger——My hand is  messed up.,8,12
rachel,I am not going to answer that!,8,12
joey,"Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if  you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?",8,12
rachel,"No one! They are my friends, I wouldn't punch any of them.",8,12
joey,Chandler?,8,12
rachel,"Yeah, but I don't know why. Look at me, I'm having such a  wonderful time!",8,12
joey,"Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!",8,12
rachel,I know!,8,12
joey,I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?,8,12
rachel,"Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.",8,12
joey,"I got to say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so  much.",8,12
rachel,Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.,8,12
joey,Huh. Huh.,8,12
rachel,"All right, now don't judge me. I normally wait until my date  leaves, but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan.",8,12
joey,"Ah! Okay, well then you don't judge me. I'm going to suck on the  cellophane from the brownie I had before.",8,12
rachel,"So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end of the night moves?",8,12
joey,"Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips  look irresistible.",8,12
rachel,How do you do that?,8,12
joey,"Now you can't tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm.",8,12
rachel,Oh my God!,8,12
joey,"Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling you. Okay all right, so now  you go.",8,12
rachel,"No, I don't want to tell you.",8,12
joey,Why not?,8,12
rachel,Because it's embarrassing.,8,12
joey,"More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?!  I didn't say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just  tell me!",8,12
rachel,"Okay. All right, stand up.  Well, when we're  at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a  second, and then I make this sound, ""Hmmm."" Okay, I know it doesn't sound  like anything, but I swear it works.",8,12
joey,"Yeah. Why—Yeah, that would work for you",8,12
rachel,"All right, I got to go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.",8,12
joey,Oh.  Yeah.  Me to.,8,12
rachel,"you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!",8,12
ross,"No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the  phrase, ""Get the hell out of my way!""",8,12
rachel,"Well, why didn't you just take a cab?",8,12
ross,"Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets  it'll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I?  Rockefeller?",8,12
rachel,Well you are not going to be able to keep doing this.,8,12
ross,"Well I have to. Okay? If I don't, they'll take the class away  from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.",8,12
rachel,You what?,8,12
ross,"You've seen it, the Geller Yeller.",8,12
rachel,Right. Wow!,8,12
ross,"Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I'm sure I can  make it this time. I just…I just can't be afraid to get a little bit…hit by  cars.",8,12
joey,Hey!,8,12
rachel,"Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?",8,12
joey,"Oh yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo.  What is wrong with you?",8,12
rachel,Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!,8,12
joey,Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?,8,12
rachel,"Yeah I know it's really boring, but it's like a big deal.  Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.",8,12
joey,"Oh yeah? All right, let's do it tonight.",8,12
rachel,Well don't you have that big date tonight?,8,12
joey,Oh right!,8,12
rachel,"Hey Joey, can I ask you something?",8,12
joey,Yeah.,8,12
rachel,"After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?",8,12
joey,"Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!",8,12
rachel,I don't know!  I'm-I'm kind of thinking it-it was  the lobster,8,12
joey,"Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.",8,12
rachel,"Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.",8,12
joey,"Yeah me too, all night.",8,12
rachel,Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?,8,12
joey,"Yeah well that is because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, you  don't want to look in my hamper.",8,12
monica,"Okay, I got that. I'll escape over there. I'll come back over  here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It's got—Right—  Well, you are just a little bitch, aren't you?",8,12
phoebe,"Hey, you guys. Listen, I'm sorry that I was hogging the  game before——Oh my God! Your friends have some  unfortunate initials!",8,12
monica,They're all Chandler.,8,12
phoebe,Chandler sucks! He couldn't have gotten this good!,8,12
chandler,I did.  But it came at a price.,8,12
monica,But Ben is coming over tonight and he can't see this.,8,12
chandler,"Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!",8,12
ross,"Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I'm on time!  Okay,  why don't we all uh,  open our books to page 23. Where…  Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots. Okay,  umm, why don't, why don't you all start to read, while I—",8,12
date,Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.,8,12
joey,"No-no! I'm fine. It's just… Hey, can I ask you something?  Have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while and then  suddenly…suddenly see them a different way?",8,12
date,You mean like from behind?,8,12
joey,"Yeah. Yeah, that…that is exactly it. you are right. Yeah.",8,12
date,"Ew, you know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he  seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!",8,12

rachel,Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!,8,12
joey,"Hey, did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car and  Cujo's throwing' himself at the windshield?",8,12
rachel,"No! No! Seriously, what's wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what  are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?",8,12
joey,"Oh uh, it didn't work out.",8,12
rachel,Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?,8,12
joey,"Oh uh, okay. Yeah.",8,12
rachel,"You know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie, but I  really hope this dog dies.  What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect  me.",8,12
joey,"Oh sure, yeah, why not?",8,12
rachel,"Okay.  Okay, that is him! that is him! that is  Cujo! that is Cujo!",8,12
joey,"All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay.",8,12
rachel,"Oh my God….What's he going to do now? I can't watch!  Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this?  Aren't you scared?",8,12
joey,Terrified.,8,12
ross,"So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now,  the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.  Here.  Here.  Now as for the hydrosaurs",8,12
joey,"All right. It's a new day. All that stuff about  Rachel, you don't feel that now. It was crazy! you are fine.  you are better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Great!  Everything's normal! She's just your friend Rachel! Your friend  Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.",8,13
rachel,"Hi, sweetie.",8,13
joey,"Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!",8,13
monica,Hi.,8,13
chandler,"Are you, are you high?",8,13
monica,I just had the most amazing bath.,8,13
chandler,Really? I don't like baths.,8,13
monica,"Wait, you like them with me.",8,13
chandler,"Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady.",8,13
monica,"Oh, baths are so relaxing!",8,13
chandler,Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.,8,13
monica,"How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles  and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.",8,13
chandler,"Honey, it's 2",8,13
joey,"Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.",8,13
chandler,"Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?",8,13
joey,"Well, neither.",8,13
chandler,"Oh my God, what's up?!",8,13
joey,"I don't know. It's-it's just…lately, I've been  feeling… Okay, here's what it is…  You know what? I feel a lot  better, thanks!",8,13
chandler,"Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back.",8,13
joey,"All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are  rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that is different. I mean, there are  rules there, too! You know what I mean?",8,13
chandler,Do you?,8,13
joey,"It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same  place, right?",8,13
chandler,In London?,8,13
joey,Yeah.,8,13
chandler,"Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.",8,13
joey,"You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a  favour, this conversation was between you and me.",8,13
chandler,If that.,8,13
rachel,"Hi! Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment  tomorrow!",8,13
ross,Right.,8,13
phoebe,"Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?",8,13
ross,"No-no, we talked about it. We don't want to know. All we care about is  that it's happy and healthy.",8,13
rachel,Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!,8,13
ross,And smart!,8,13
rachel,Popular.,8,13
ross,With an aptitude for science.,8,13
phoebe,Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking  of names yet?,8,13
rachel,Oh yeah! I've come up with a bunch of ideas!,8,13
ross,Really? Me too!,8,13
phoebe,Me too!,8,13
rachel,Really?!,8,13
phoebe,"Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!",8,13
ross,"Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach,  what were you thinking?",8,13
rachel,"Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's  French.",8,13
ross,Huh. that is a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.,8,13
rachel,"Okay fine, what do you have?",8,13
ross,"Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there,  but…Darwin.",8,13
rachel,"Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.",8,13
phoebe,"Yeah, by Sandrine.",8,13
ross,you are just saying thatBecause I said no to your name!,8,13
rachel,"I'm really, really not.",8,13
phoebe,How-how about you each get five vetoes?,8,13
ross,All right.,8,13
rachel,All right.,8,13
ross,That sounds fair.,8,13
rachel,"Yeah! I don't think you are going to need it though. Okay, check  this out. If it's a girl, Rain.",8,13
ross,Veto.,8,13
rachel,Why?,8,13
ross,"Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out  of wheat.",8,13
phoebe,I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!,8,13
ross,"Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?",8,13
rachel,"Ross, why do you hate our child?",8,13
ross,"Fine, you go.",8,13
rachel,"Okay, James.",8,13
ross,Huh.,8,13
rachel,But only if it's a girl.,8,13
ross,"Oh, veto. How about—Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?",8,13
rachel,Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?,8,13
ross,Veto. Stewart?,8,13
rachel,Veto. Sawyer?,8,13
ross,Veto. Helen?,8,13
rachel,Veto.,8,13
phoebe,"Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?",8,13
chandler,Hey.,8,13
monica,"Boy, do I have a surprise for you!",8,13
chandler,Sex on the balcony?,8,13
monica,"No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?",8,13
chandler,What is it?,8,13
monica,I drew you a bath!,8,13
chandler,"Honey, I don't like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having  sex on the balcony?",8,13
monica,"Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff!  I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got  you this little plastic Navy ship. So it's a boy bath!",8,13
chandler,"Well, this does butch it up a bit.",8,13
monica,"I swear, if you try it, you will love it!",8,13
chandler,"All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?",8,13
monica,Absolutely.,8,13
monica,Bet I know how that discussion's going to go.,8,13
chandler,"All right, this isn't so bad. I like the flower  smell! Which is okay, because I've got my boat.",8,13
monica,So?,8,13
chandler,Oh my God.,8,13
monica,"I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you  a facial!",8,13
chandler,I'm going to need a bigger boat.,8,13
ross,"I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on,  little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?",8,13
rachel,"Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!",8,13
dr. long,"Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing  the sex of the baby?",8,13
ross,"Uh, no. No, we're not.",8,13
rachel,But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether  it's a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?,8,13
dr. long,that is right. But if you don't want to know,8,13
ross,"No, no, we want to wait, right?",8,13
rachel,Right. Right.,8,13
dr. long,"Oh, I'll be right back. And, uh, I know  it's really not my place, but please don't name your child Phoebo.",8,13
rachel,"So, which of these  babies do you think is the ugliest?",8,13
ross,"What? Rach! Come on, that is terrible!  They're…uh…they're babies. They're-they're all beautiful.",8,13
rachel,Third one from the left?,8,13
ross,"Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I'm talking about it.   Don't-don't you—Wh—Wha—Hey!!",8,13
rachel,What?!,8,13
ross,you are looking!,8,13
rachel,I didn't!,8,13
ross,I saw you!,8,13
rachel,"Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear.",8,13
ross,Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!,8,13
rachel,"Okay, but Ross just listen to me",8,13
ross,"No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!",8,13
rachel,"But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I  swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary  lapse.",8,13
ross,Momentary lapse. Don't-don't you have any self-control?,8,13
rachel,"Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.",8,13
monica,Hello?,8,13
chandler,"I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's  something wrong.",8,13
monica,You know what? I-I think I'll wait out here.,8,13
chandler,I'm in the bathtub.,8,13
monica,Oh.  What's wrong?,8,13
chandler,"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water's tepid. The salt  didn't dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don't  compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!",8,13
monica,What?,8,13
chandler,The bath salts! They're starting to effervesce! It's different.   It's interesting.,8,13
monica,"Okay, let's talk about something else.",8,13
chandler,"Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!",8,13
monica,"Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking  about rules and right and wrong and",8,13
chandler,I had the exact same conversation.,8,13
monica,You did? What was he talking about?,8,13
chandler,I don't know! Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out  words since we saw him in Macbeth!,8,13
monica,That was a long night.,8,13
chandler,"All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?",8,13
monica,"Okay, he was talking about rules.",8,13
chandler,Uh-huh.,8,13
monica,"Umm, and looking at people differently.",8,13
chandler,He didn't say anything about that to me.,8,13
monica,What did he tell you?,8,13
chandler,"He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of  course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.",8,13
monica,"Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants  to do what you and I did in London with someone.",8,13
chandler,But what did he mean by rules?,8,13
monica,Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!,8,13
chandler,Because he was looking at her differently.,8,13
monica,"And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!",8,13
chandler,My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!,8,13
phoebe,You guys?,8,13
monica,Just a minute!  that is Mrs. Tribbiani!,8,13
chandler,You don't say anything.,8,13
monica,"Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the  greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all  start having babies?",8,13
chandler,I'm not going to let you say anything.,8,13
monica,You just stay here!,8,13
chandler,"Oh, God!",8,13
phoebe,"Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.",8,13
monica,"Oh, you had that?",8,13
phoebe,Uh-huh.,8,13
monica,"I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.",8,13
phoebe,"Oh, just as well, I broke this one.",8,13
phoebe,What?,8,13
monica,Nothing.,8,13
phoebe,Okay.,8,13
monica,"I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say. I mean, I'm really not  supposed to.",8,13
phoebe,Fine.,8,13
monica,It's a humdinger!,8,13
phoebe,Then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.,8,13
monica,Somebody likes you!,8,13
phoebe,Is it Chandler?,8,13
monica,No!,8,13
phoebe,"Well, then tell him to stop staring!",8,13
monica,It's Joey!,8,13
phoebe,Really?! Joey?! You don't say.,8,13
monica,Is it something you'd be interested in?,8,13
phoebe,"I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. You know, I mean,  on the one hand, Mother may I? But you know on the other hand… No. No, I  can't. We're friends. No, oh, no. I don't want to risk what we have.",8,13
monica,"I guess that makes sense. So, you think you are going to talk to him?",8,13
phoebe,"Sure, yeah. I mean, it's Joey. I don't want him to get hurt.  Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!",8,13
monica,"Not Chandler, just Joey.",8,13
phoebe,Sure.,8,13
rachel,Hey.,8,13
ross,Hey.,8,13
rachel,You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming  around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.,8,13
ross,"Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me! OH… Wait a  minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind?  Unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You  know it's a boy!",8,13
rachel,I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.,8,13
ross,"I don't think so! you are just giving me Ruth so you'll get to  name it when it's a boy, and that is when you'll swoop in and name him Heath  or Blaine or Sequoia.",8,13
rachel,I would—Sequoia?,8,13
ross,Veto.,8,13
rachel,Fine.,8,13
ross,"Unless…  You anticipated that I would figure all  this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named  Ruth! Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!",8,13
rachel,"But Ross, you want the name Ruth!",8,13
ross,Not like this!,8,13
phoebe,Hey.,8,13
joey,"Hey. Well, what's up?",8,13
phoebe,"Umm, Joey, I know.",8,13
joey,What?,8,13
phoebe,I know.,8,13
joey,What?,8,13
phoebe,I know about your feelings.,8,13
joey,Oh my God. You do?,8,13
phoebe,"Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and  Monica, but that is very rare.",8,13
joey,"I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those  guys. I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes.",8,13
phoebe,"For God sakes, it's Rachel!",8,13
joey,I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant  friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!,8,13
phoebe,Yeah that is Rachel.  Beat me over the head with it.,8,13
joey,"What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of  these feelings, you know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I  don't like about her. You want to hear it?",8,13
phoebe,Yeah.,8,13
joey,"She made me switch to light Mayo. that is it! that is all I got! And,  you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!",8,13
phoebe,"Joey, I just think you are getting worked up over nothing. This is  probably just a crush.",8,13
joey,You think?,8,13
phoebe,"Absolutely! You know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes  away.",8,13
joey,"Yeah, just a crush! that is all this is! It's a crush! I'm  Joey; I don't get deep feelings.",8,13
phoebe,"that is right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know  I've had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I'm sure  you've had them for us.",8,13
joey,Not really.,8,13
phoebe,Mm-hmm.  Throw me a bone here.,8,13
ross,"So, I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.",8,13
rachel,What?,8,13
ross,that is right. The student has become the master.,8,13
rachel,"Ross, I swear, I don't know.",8,13
ross,"Oh, come on, you know it's a girl!",8,13
rachel,A what?!,8,13
ross,You really didn't know?,8,13
rachel,We're having a girl?,8,13
ross,No.,8,13
rachel,that is what you just said!,8,13
ross,No.,8,13
rachel,You said girl!,8,13
ross,Yes. I'm… I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.,8,13
rachel,I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe  it's with you—But still! We're having a girl!,8,13
ross,I know! I know. You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table!,8,13
rachel,"Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth",8,13
ross,Permission to veto.,8,13
rachel,"Yes, please.",8,13
monica,Hey.,8,13
chandler,Do I smell essential oils?,8,13
monica,"Yeah, I'm going to take a bath. I'm just going to get a magazine.",8,13
chandler,Okay.,8,13
monica,What do you think you are doing?,8,13
chandler,L-leaving my troubles behind?,8,13
monica,"I know that you are new at this, but this is completely unacceptable  bath decorum.",8,13
chandler,"Oh, it's so hard to care when you are this relaxed.",8,13
monica,"Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you are  just a girl in a tub!",8,13
chandler,Hey!,8,13
phoebe,"Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know  how it went with Joey.",8,13
chandler,You told her?!,8,13
monica,She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard!  How'd it go?,8,13
phoebe,"Well, you were wrong, he doesn't like me!",8,13
monica,What?,8,13
phoebe,"Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house and  told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn't  like you? How would you feel?",8,13
monica,I don't think I'd care.,8,13
phoebe,Really? Lee Majors is hot!,8,13
joey,Hello?,8,13
phoebe,We're in the bathroom!,8,13
joey,Why?,8,13
chandler,Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!,8,13
joey,What are you guys doing in here?,8,13
monica,"Oh my God! A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong.  It's Rachel!",8,13
chandler,You like Rachel?!,8,13
joey,"It's no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It's just a  crush! It's going to go away!  Dude, you got to rearrange your bubbles!  Oh!",8,13
phoebe,Mazel tov.,8,13
rachel,"Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in  here?  Oh, my!",8,13
monica,"Honey, cover it up with the boat!",8,13
ross,Hello?,8,13
chandler,Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to  join us!,8,13
ross,"Well hey! What's going on? Ooh, cool boat——Oh, no.    Hey, did you, did you tell them?",8,13
rachel,"No, I was waiting for you!",8,13
phoebe,Tell us what?,8,13
rachel,We're having a girl.,8,13
all,"Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!",8,13
chandler,I'll…I'll get you later!,8,13
joey,"All right. It's a new day, and it's just a  crush, that is all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing,  that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, ""it  was cuckoo!"" Everything's going to be fine. It's just a crush.",8,13
rachel,"Hi, sweetie.",8,13
joey,I love you.,8,13
monica,"It sure is nice to do this together, isn't it?",8,13
chandler,Yeah. And what you are doing feels so good.,8,13
monica,I'm not touching you.,8,13
chandler,you are not?,8,13
monica,It's the salts.,8,13
chandler,"Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!",8,13
monica,"Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!",8,13
monica,"Hey, what's up?",8,14
phoebe,"Well, I left my guitar here again.",8,14
monica,"Oh, okay. No problem.",8,14
phoebe,Okay.,8,14

phoebe,Oh are you and Chandler-,8,14
monica,Yes! Exactly.,8,14
phoebe,Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?,8,14
monica,No.,8,14
chandler,"Hey Pheebs, what's up?",8,14
phoebe,You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.,8,14
phoebe,Oh my God! you are getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!,8,14
monica,"Phoebe, I can explain!",8,14
phoebe,You told me you hate massages!,8,14
chandler,"Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning-Don't let Phoebe in.",8,14
phoebe,I can't believe this! How long as this been going on?,8,14
monica,"Well umm, Alexandra has been-",8,14
phoebe,"Oh, it has a name?",8,14
monica,"Phoebe, don't get upset!",8,14
phoebe,Okay-Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on Chandler let's go!,8,14

joey,"Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we're almost there! We're almost there!",8,14
rachel,"Oh Joey, I'm so happy things worked out for us that we're having this baby together. I love you so much.",8,14
joey,"Oh, I love you too.",8,14

chandler,Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?,8,14
monica,"No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?",8,14
chandler,How about to the street say from the balcony?,8,14
monica,Why don't we just find a place for it?,8,14
chandler,Okay. How about in that cabinet?,8,14
monica,No! that is where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?,8,14
chandler,How about the closet by the bathroom?,8,14
monica,"Oh, okay. Here, why don't you let me do it?",8,14
chandler,"Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.  It's locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?",8,14
monica,No reason. I-I keep private things in there.,8,14
chandler,"OH you know, I've been living here a while and I've never seen what's inside that closet. What is, what is in there?",8,14
monica,Feminine stuff.,8,14
chandler,Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!,8,14
monica,"Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you'll let it go.",8,14
chandler,Fine.,8,14
monica,Thank you!,8,14
chandler,Love you.,8,14
phoebe,"Hello Chandler, lovely day huh?  You!",8,14
chandler,"Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.  If! I said, ""If it helps!""",8,14
phoebe,Why won't you let me massage you?,8,14
monica,Well it's-I mean I'd just-I'd be self-conscious. you are my friend; I'd be naked.,8,14
phoebe,Monica! We lived together for years! I've seen you naked!,8,14
monica,"that is different, we were roommates! And when?!",8,14
phoebe,I'm curious about the human body.,8,14
monica,"Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.",8,14
phoebe,"But I'm a professional! And I'm really good! Look, if you are uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?",8,14
monica,"Okay, if it means that much to you-",8,14
phoebe,It does! How would you feel if you couldn't share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn't teach us about dragons.,8,14
monica,Dinosaurs.,8,14
phoebe,"Potato, potaato.",8,14
ross,Hey!,8,14
joey,Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!,8,14
ross,What?! It is?!,8,14
rachel,It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.,8,14
ross,"Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?",8,14
rachel,Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping-,8,14
joey,A dreamless sleep.,8,14
ross,"My God, the baby's kicking. that is great. Although I-kind of wish I-I would've been there to feel the kicking for the first time you know.",8,14
joey,Well I got stuff going on in here  if you want to feel.,8,14
ross,"Look, I-I don't want to miss anymore baby stuff. So-Here. Here's my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I'll be there! Okay? I don't care if it's three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.",8,14
joey,Wow! Can I get a copy of that?,8,14
phoebe,Are you under the sheet?,8,14
monica,Yes.,8,14
phoebe,"Great, let's begin.  How's the pressure?",8,14
monica,Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!,8,14

chandler,I wasn't trying to open your closet! I wasn't trying to open your closet! I swear!,8,14
joey,"Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?",8,14
chandler,Monica has a secret closet and she won't let me see what's in it.,8,14
joey,Why not?,8,14
chandler,I don't know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!,8,14
joey,"I don't know. Ooh, I bet it's Richard.",8,14
chandler,Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?,8,14
joey,"Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she's having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!",8,14
chandler,And here we go-,8,14
joey,"I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. You know it wouldn't kill you to respect your wife's privacy!  Stupid closet full of bugs!",8,14
rachel,"Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don't-Whoa!!",8,14
joey,"Oh hey whoa-whoa, don't worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.",8,14
rachel,Really?,8,14
joey,"Absolutely. But, we're going to stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I'll page Ross on the way. Come on.",8,14
rachel,Okay. Oh God-Ow!-Oo!,8,14
joey,"Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything's going to be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go.  Oww crushing bones!",8,14
joey,Hey! So?,8,14
dr. long,"She's fine. She's experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.",8,14
rachel,"Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?",8,14
joey,So but everything is normal.,8,14
dr. long,Absolutely.,8,14
joey,And-and there's no danger to her and the baby?,8,14
dr. long,"No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you don't know what they are, but she's fine.",8,14
rachel,Thank you doctor.   Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.,8,14
joey,Calm?! I wasn't calm! I've never been more scared in all my life!,8,14
rachel,But wait you said everything was going to be okay.,8,14
joey,Well what do I know?! I'm not a doctor!,8,14
rachel,But I-But everything is okay. I'm fine!,8,14
joey,You sure?!,8,14
rachel,"Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus though. Mild discomfort, what's he talking about?",8,14
joey,Oh hey-hey!,8,14
ross,Is everything okay?,8,14
rachel,"Yeah, everything's fine!",8,14
ross,"Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?",8,14
joey,Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.,8,14
ross,"Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don't even feel them.",8,14
rachel,"Okay, no uterus, no opinion.",8,14
joey,"Hey uh, what's with the candy?",8,14
ross,Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theatre.,8,14
rachel,Oh you went to the movies by yourself?,8,14
ross,No I-Mona!,8,14
rachel,"Oh, I got to go back in there.",8,14
ross,What? Why? What's wrong?,8,14
rachel,"No, everything's fine. I just got to go back-",8,14
ross,"No really, you tell me what's up.",8,14
rachel,I-I forgot my underwear.,8,14
ross,"So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.",8,14
joey,"Oh hey, don't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal.",8,14
ross,"Yeah but still, I mean it should've been me. I'm the dad.",8,14
dr. long,"Uh, if you have any questions, here's some information on Braxton-Hicks.  Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in. you are going to make a wonderful father.",8,14
joey,"Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy!  He brought Twizlers!",8,14
chandler,There has got to be a way!,8,14
joey,"Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?",8,14
chandler,"Yeah.  Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl.",8,14
joey,Then why do you throw like one?,8,14
chandler,Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.,8,14
joey,"Sure. ""Monica.""",8,14
chandler,"So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?",8,14
joey,"Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now.  Wow, you sure found that quick.  I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, you know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think-I think Ross feels left out. You know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God- You should've seen the look on Ross's face.  By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?",8,14
chandler,that is a good idea.,8,14
joey,Yeah.,8,14
chandler,"Okay.  So uh, Ross is kind of bummed huh?",8,14
joey,"Oh, I just-I feel terrible.",8,14
chandler,"Well, it's not your fault. What are you going to do? Not take her to the hospital? You know? you are doing nothing wrong.  Except for harbouring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby.  Richard? If-if you are in there, could you pass me my credit card?",8,14
monica,Hey.,8,14
phoebe,Hey.,8,14
monica,"I got to tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!",8,14
phoebe,"No-no, I got that.",8,14
monica,"So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?",8,14
phoebe,"Okay. Okay but you should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.",8,14
monica,Okay.,8,14
phoebe,I mean $500.,8,14
monica,What?,8,14
phoebe,600,8,14
monica,What's going on?,8,14
phoebe,"Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!",8,14
monica,What?,8,14
phoebe,"Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.",8,14
monica,What?! you are crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!,8,14
phoebe,Really? There's nothing sexual about this?  Ooh. Oo God! OH. oh. OH.   What are you looking at?!  I mean hi.,8,14
monica,"Oh my-This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I'm never going to get massaged again!",8,14
phoebe,"No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",8,14
monica,Really?!,8,14
phoebe,"Well not clients, lovers. But let's just you know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll work through it.",8,14
monica,Are you sure?,8,14
phoebe,Yes.,8,14
monica,I guess.,8,14
phoebe,"Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?",8,14
rachel,Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!,8,14
ross,"Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.",8,14
rachel,OH! that is so sweet of you! Oh yum!  Did you put pickles on this?,8,14
ross,Well yeah!,8,14
rachel,Oh Ross!!,8,14
ross,What?! What?! Rach what?!,8,14
joey,What's going on?,8,14
ross,"I made her favourite, tuna salad with pickles.",8,14
joey,Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.,8,14
ross,"I-I'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you going to be okay?",8,14
rachel,"Yeah, I'll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?",8,14
joey,I'm on it!,8,14
ross,I can't believe this! I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!,8,14
joey,Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.,8,14
ross,"Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don't know any of it and I'm the father. I wish I'd be more involved you know.",8,14
rachel,"Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.",8,14
joey,"Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?",8,14
ross,Yeah.,8,14
rachel,What's up?,8,14
joey,"Uh, sit down. I want to talk about our situation.",8,14
rachel,Are you breaking up with us?,8,14
joey,"The thing is-because I live with Rachel I'm here for a lot of the stuff, okay?  And Ross-Ross is missing everything. So-",8,14
rachel,Yeah?,8,14
joey,Maybe you two should live together.,8,14
rachel,Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?,8,14
joey,"Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that-if you are going to have a roommate, you know it might as well be the father.",8,14
rachel,"But Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean--Or he does.",8,14
ross,No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.,8,14
rachel,"But Ross, its you and me!",8,14
ross,So? Sure! But it-it wouldn't be anything romantic. And I'm-I'm dating Mona-Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!,8,14
joey,"All right now, so? What do you think?",8,14
rachel,I don't know. Is it crazy?,8,14
ross,"No! No it's not. Joey, this is a smart idea.",8,14
joey,"Well, I was due.",8,14
rachel,"Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.",8,14
ross,Really?,8,14
rachel,Yeah.,8,14
ross,Oh Rach that is great. that is great.,8,14
chandler,"Not to shabby, I got this all off myself-using my wife's tools.  Oh my God!",8,14
monica,How did you get in there?!,8,14
chandler,you are messy.,8,14
monica,Oh no! You weren't supposed to see this!,8,14
chandler,I married Fred Sanford!,8,14
monica,"No Chandler, you don't understand!  Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I'm you know-I'm sick.",8,14
chandler,"No, honey you are not sick! Look, I don't love you because you are organized, I love you in spite of that.",8,14
monica,Really? You promise you won't tell anyone?,8,14
chandler,"Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.",8,14
monica,Well-it's just umm-I'm afraid you might mess it up.,8,14
chandler,Hey.,8,14
joey,Hey.,8,14
chandler,So Rachel's all moved out huh? How are you taking it?,8,14
joey,"Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it's a couple weeks past it's expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick.",8,14
chandler,Are you okay?,8,14
joey,"Are you kidding me? I'm great! Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great. I am good. And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before. You know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. You know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. you know? I like being on my own, I'm uh, better off this way. I'm uh, a lone wolf. You know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What's a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!",8,14
monica,oh.,8,14
phoebe,that is it. Just relax.,8,14
monica,OH. Oh! OH!,8,14
phoebe,Come on more!,8,14
monica,Oh God!,8,14
phoebe,"Yeah, you like that don't you?",8,14
monica,Oh yeah right there!,8,14
phoebe,You want it there? You take it there baby!,8,14

phoebe,Okay.,8,15
joey,Bye.,8,15
joey,There's one lucky to-go cup of coffee.,8,15

joey,Thanks. But maybe later.,8,15
phoebe,"Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?",8,15
gunther,You want anything?,8,15
joey,You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that is never going to happen!,8,15
gunther,We have red bagels.,8,15
joey,"Oh, okay.",8,15
phoebe,"So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?",8,15
ross,"Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents, but she'll be cool. I mean, she's been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, 'Fossils are my friends.'",8,15
phoebe,"Ugh. Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass.",8,15
ross,"Uh, I'm going to take off.",8,15
phoebe,"All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!",8,15

ross,You don't want my opinion?,8,15
monica,Not really.,8,15
ross,"Come on, I'm your older brother, ask me!",8,15

ross,The red one.,8,15

phoebe,He-hee!,8,15
joey,"Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.",8,15

joey,Did I just throw this?,8,15
rachel,Hi.,8,15
joey,Hi.,8,15

monica,"Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe's. Why were you even watching it?",8,15
chandler,I thought-maybe-you got me porn for Valentine's Day.,8,15
monica,"Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine's Day-  you were right! Apparently, it's about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts!  Oh, wait a minute. Those aren't stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?",8,15
chandler,"Well, I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.",8,15

ross,Yeah?,8,15
mona,I brought you back a present.,8,15
ross,"Wha-? Oh, come on. You didn't have to-saltwater taffy?!  Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it's actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. that is not interesting.",8,15
mona,I think it's interesting.,8,15
ross,I do too! I missed you!,8,15
mona,"I missed you, too! So, how was your week?",8,15
ross,"Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!",8,15

mona,Oh no.,8,15
ross,"Yeah, I'm missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.",8,15
mona,Yeah right!,8,15
ross,What?,8,15
mona,"Joey cracks me up! It's like, 'Yeah, why don't you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn't be awkward at all!'",8,15
ross,Huh-uh-huh.,8,15
mona,"Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant!",8,15
mona,"So, what'd you tell him?",8,15
ross,Just a second!,8,15
phoebe,How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?,8,15
ross,"I don't know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!",8,15
phoebe,"Taffy, really? I've never had any.",8,15
ross,Ever?!,8,15
phoebe,"Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.  Thank you! So what, you are just never going to tell her?",8,15
ross,"Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world, then I'm going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.",8,15
phoebe,If I haven't said it before,8,15
joey,"So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.",8,15
phoebe,Hey!,8,15
joey,Hey.,8,15
phoebe,"Hey, buddy. How's my favourite dog, huh? How's my favourite dog?  you are subdued.  Did you give him a beer?",8,15
joey,No.,8,15
phoebe,"Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.",8,15
joey,"Yeah, sure. Go ahead.  Oh, me, right!",8,15
phoebe,He's miserable! What happened to him?,8,15
joey,Nothing. We just talked about stuff.,8,15
phoebe,What stuff?,8,15
joey,Rachel stuff.,8,15
phoebe,"Oh-Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!",8,15
joey,He's breathing!,8,15
phoebe,"Okay, I'm going to take him back to Wendy's.",8,15
joey,"No, no, no, no! He's fine! Look, look, look!  Here's your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball!  Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!",8,15
ross,"Well, I'm, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?",8,15
rachel,"Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans! I've got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!",8,15
ross,"You know, it's interesting! Most people think that is made with seawater, when in fact-",8,15
rachel,"Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.",8,15
rachel,Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!,8,15
ross,"Mona? What are-hi! What are you doing here? I'm, um, supposed to pick you up!",8,15
mona,"Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine's dinner! Surprise!",8,15
ross,Ayyyayyyy!,8,15
rachel,"Oh, hey, Mona!",8,15
mona,"Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel!  What's she doing here?",8,15
ross,I have no idea!,8,15
rachel,I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.,8,15
mona,"Seriously, what is she doing?",8,15
ross,"Uh-lately, she just likes hanging out here.",8,15
mona,Why?,8,15
ross,I think she's lonely.,8,15
mona,"Okay, but it's Valentine's Day!",8,15
ross,I know.,8,15
mona,Can't we just ask her to go?,8,15
ross,"No, no. She's way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.",8,15
rachel,I'm not here! that is just my Chinese food!,8,15
mona,"Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?",8,15
ross,"Mm-hmm. She's-she's emotional, but, but ballsy.",8,15
rachel,"You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!",8,15
ross,"And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don't you, uh, open the champagne, and I'll be right back. I've got a surprise for you.",8,15
mona,You got another ex-wife back there?,8,15
ross,Please start drinking!,8,15
rachel,I'm just going to grab the phone.,8,15
mona,"Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but, but, um- what are you doing?",8,15
rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry! Do you need the phone?",8,15
mona,"No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we got to have some boundaries, so why don't you go back to your place and give us some privacy?",8,15
rachel,"But, but, Mona, I live here.",8,15
ross,Happy Valentine's Day! -Or something to remember me by.,8,15
monica,How long has it been this time?,8,15
chandler,90 seconds.,8,15
monica,that is better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it-except all I did was think about it.,8,15
chandler,"You know, it haunts me? Up 'til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!",8,15
monica,"Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?",8,15
chandler,I can do that.,8,15
monica,Okay.,8,15
chandler,Okay. Now all we've got to do is get rid of this chair.,8,15
monica,"Oh, thank God!",8,15
chandler,"Oh, I know!",8,15
monica,Come in!,8,15
rachel,"Hi! I'm so sorry to barge in on your Valentine's, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.",8,15
monica,"Oh, my God.",8,15
chandler,Poor Ross.,8,15
chandler,"Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!",8,15
monica,"Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It's here.",8,15
chandler,"Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it",8,15
rachel,Why? You saw it? Is it scary?,8,15
chandler,"Well, let's just say it's ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.",8,15
rachel,"Well, now, wait. Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.",8,15
monica,"No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!",8,15
rachel,"C'mon, seriously, you guys, you are not going to make me watch this alone!",8,15
monica,"She's right-of course not. Honey, get the tape.",8,15
chandler,"This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.  Okay, here we go.",8,15
rachel,"Okay.  Ooh, my!  Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!",8,15
chandler,Why have I seen this thing three times?!,8,15
monica,It's-still beautiful.,8,15
rachel,Uh! It's horrible!,8,15
monica,"I know! I know, I'm so sorry for you!",8,15
rachel,"Oh, my God!",8,15
chandler,"Wait, you guys, look!",8,15
rachel,What? Did her ass explode?!,8,15
chandler,"No, the baby's out! Look, look!",8,15
monica,"Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!",8,15
chandler,And look how happy the mom is now!,8,15
monica,Oh-Rach!,8,15
rachel,"Oh, screw you guys, you don't have to do it!",8,15
ross,"Hey, hey, man!",8,15
joey,"Hey, what's up?",8,15
ross,Uh-Mona just dumped me.,8,15
joey,"Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?",8,15
ross,"Well, with everything that is been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?",8,15
joey,"Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day.",8,15
ross,"Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day? What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?",8,15
joey,Sort of.,8,15
ross,Really?!,8,15
joey,You don't have to seem so happy about it.,8,15
ross,"Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.",8,15
joey,"Oh, I-I d-",8,15
ross,"Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. you know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex.",8,15
ross,"Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?",8,15
joey,Forget about it. It's no big deal.,8,15
ross,C'mon! Joey! What is it?,8,15
joey,It's nothing.,8,15
ross,"Hey, hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?",8,15
joey,"Okay, uh-sit down.  Um- there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh-it can't happen.",8,15
ross,She's not a Tribbiani?,8,15
joey,No!,8,15
ross,"I knew it. So, is she someone from work?",8,15
joey,Yes.,8,15
ross,"Well, uh, does she like you?",8,15
joey,"Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.",8,15
ross,Why not?,8,15
joey,"Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends.",8,15
ross,"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh- is he still in love with her?",8,15
joey,No. I don't think so.,8,15
ross,Okay. Um- is he a good guy?,8,15
joey,"Yeah, he's the best.",8,15
ross,Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.,8,15
joey,"Oh, I don't know.",8,15
ross,"Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.",8,15
joey,"I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-",8,15
ross,"Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.",8,15
gunther,Here's your warm milk.,8,15
ross,"I'm going to-uh-I'm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.",8,15
joey,"Oh, yeah.",8,15
ross,"Anyway- seriously, uh-just-just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.",8,15
joey,It's Rachel.,8,15
rachel,"you are going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, you are going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!",8,15
woman on tv,I came to the big city to become a star! I'll do-anything to make that happen!,8,15
man on tv,Anything?,8,15
rachel,Hmm-maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.,8,15
lisa kudrow,Previously on Friends,8,16
joey,"There's this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, you know? 'Cause we're really good friends.",8,16
ross,"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh- is he a good guy?",8,16
joey,"Yeah, he's the best.",8,16
ross,Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.,8,16
joey,"Oh, I don't know.",8,16
ross,"Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.",8,16
joey,"I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-",8,16
ross,"Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.",8,16
joey,It's Rachel.,8,16
ross,"Did you um-I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?",8,16
joey,Yes.,8,16
ross,"Um, you-you like Rachel?",8,16
joey,Yes. I like Rachel.,8,16
ross,Rachel?!,8,16
joey,"Yeah, okay but look, buy uh-Hey-hey, you know, you know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross.",8,16
ross,But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!,8,16
joey,"Yeah, but it's not a big deal.",8,16
ross,"It's not a big deal? Oh, I'm sorry I just-um, I-what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like-you-you can't stop thinking about her. Like how you can't sleep?",8,16
joey,"I'm an actor, you know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.",8,16
ross,Rachel who's carrying my baby? Rachel?,8,16
joey,"Look no, I-I know it's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever going to happen. You know? These-these are just feelings, they're going to go away.",8,16
ross,You know what? I-I got to go.,8,16
joey,Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't-,8,16
ross,I just-You know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!,8,16
gunther,Rachel?!!,8,16
rachel,"Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!",8,16
chandler,Oh!  She's growing inside you.,8,16
rachel,Whoa!!,8,16
chandler,Oh!,8,16
rachel,Wow that was a big one.,8,16
chandler,I think that is the youngest girl ever to reject me.,8,16
phoebe,Oh hey you guys!,8,16
chandler,Oh hey!,8,16
rachel,Hi!,8,16
phoebe,"Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?",8,16
rachel,Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. that is why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He'll find me.,8,16
phoebe,"Uh-huh,  and you?",8,16
chandler,"No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist.",8,16
phoebe,"Okay, good.",8,16
chandler,Why?,8,16
phoebe,"Well last night, I met Monica's.",8,16
chandler,What?,8,16
phoebe,"Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.",8,16
chandler,"Come on, don't be crazy.  You don't think there's someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do you?",8,16
rachel,"Well, what's he like?!",8,16
phoebe,Well he's tall.,8,16
rachel,Uh-huh.,8,16
phoebe,He has brown hair.,8,16
rachel,"Of course, of course.",8,16
chandler,"A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!",8,16
phoebe,He works with food!,8,16
rachel,Oh sure. Older?,8,16
phoebe,"Obviously, and he's British.",8,16
rachel,"Oh, I was just going to ask!",8,16
phoebe,"Yeah? And, he's-he's so cantered and mature and confident.",8,16
rachel,"Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.",8,16
chandler,"Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you are talking about.",8,16
phoebe,"Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, and maybe I'm wrong! I but-You know I'm going to go out with him again, I'll find out more.",8,16
chandler,You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you are still going to date him?,8,16
phoebe,"Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's got to eat.",8,16
monica,Hey.,8,16
ross,Hey.,8,16
monica,"I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were.",8,16
ross,"OH you know, I still-I can't believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it's- It's like you and me going out, only weirder!",8,16
monica,"All right, I know you are hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again.",8,16
ross,"Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he'd be the stepfather of my child.",8,16
monica,"Honey, I don't think that is something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never going to tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react.",8,16
ross,"Sure, because women never like Joey. You know, I think he's a virgin.",8,16
monica,Joey-he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!,8,16
ross,He's not?,8,16
monica,"No! All he's thinking about is how you are taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont.",8,16
ross,Why?,8,16
monica,He says he wants to leave the country.  He thinks you hate him.,8,16
ross,"Hate him? I- No, I don't hate him.  It's just it's Rachel, you know?",8,16
monica,"Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you are still his friend.",8,16
ross,"Okay. Okay, I'll talk to him.",8,16
monica,"All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.",8,16
phoebe,Oh! Hi!,8,16
monica,Hi!,8,16
phoebe,"Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.",8,16
don,"Oh, hello.  Hello.",8,16
phoebe,Soul mate.,8,16
chandler,What?,8,16
phoebe,Soul mate.,8,16
monica,"So, what have you guys been doing?",8,16
don,"Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?",8,16
monica,"I know! What is this, 1985?!",8,16
don,"that is exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn't that strange.",8,16
monica,Not really.,8,16
chandler,What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  On a barbecue chicken pizza?  No?,8,16
monica,"So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?",8,16
don,"Well, Octavio, 27 7-Oh! And there's this great little place, Alessandro's.",8,16
monica,"Oh my God! that is my restaurant, I'm the chef there.",8,16
don,you are kidding me!,8,16
monica,No!,8,16
don,"Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?",8,16
monica,"Oh, I'd like a latte. OH you know what? If you are going to talk about me, I'm going to go with you.",8,16
chandler,What are you doing?!,8,16
phoebe,Nothing! I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates. So-,8,16
chandler,"I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!",8,16
phoebe,"They're just talking, and you know what? Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's going to happen.",8,16
monica,"Phoebe, good work.",8,16
phoebe,Yeah?,8,16
monica,"Yeah! Oh he's great, I love him.",8,16
phoebe,"Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.",8,16
joey,Hey.,8,16
ross,Hey.,8,16
joey,"Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.",8,16
ross,"No, I don't want to hit you.",8,16
joey,Oh what then? Kick me?,8,16
ross,No.,8,16
joey,Bite me?,8,16
ross,"No, no I don't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and-and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.",8,16
joey,Oh now-Hey Ross-Ross! Do you want to-want to come in for a beer or something?,8,16
ross,Uh-yeah sure.,8,16
joey,"Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don't-",8,16
ross,Okay.,8,16
joey,"Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh-I am never going to act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.",8,16
ross,Thank you.,8,16
joey,"Anyway, it uh-look it'll just-take me a while to get over her, that is all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so-",8,16
ross,What?! you are in love with her.,8,16
joey,"Yeah, I thought you knew that.",8,16
ross,"Umm, no.",8,16
joey,"Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, ""Ah, I'll get over this. ""you know? I just-It just keeps getting' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. You know? What do I do?",8,16
ross,I think you need to tell her how you feel.,8,16
joey,Okay that is the green stuff talking'.,8,16
ross,"No, I'm serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this.",8,16
joey,But what if uh-and I'm not saying she will be-But-,8,16
ross,If she is where you are then uh-then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.,8,16
joey,Are you sure?,8,16
ross,"Yeah. Look if-if she's going to end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So-",8,16
joey,Hey thanks.,8,16
ross,So when do you think you are going to talk to her?,8,16
joey,Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven't even thought about what I will say. What should I say?,8,16
ross,"I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.",8,16
joey,"I'm sorry, you are right. What am I going to say?  Oh!",8,16
ross,"Yeah, tell me about it.",8,16
don,-so I've been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.,8,16
chandler,"Cheese you say? that is some pretty smelly work, huh Don?",8,16
don,Excuse me?,8,16
chandler,"Cheese, it's smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.",8,16
don,"Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I'm one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.",8,16
monica,"Me too! Yeah, Chandler can't stand it. He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.",8,16
don,And you are still married to him?,8,16
monica,"You know what I'd love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese-Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries-  And pate. Oh, I'm really not high, it's just I used to be fat.",8,16
don,"Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I've got a great little villa you can stay at.",8,16
chandler,Is it made of cheese?,8,16
don,"No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?!",8,16
monica,I'd move in tomorrow!,8,16
chandler,Oh come on!  Are you listening to this?,8,16
phoebe,I'm so sorry.,8,16
chandler,What do we do?,8,16
phoebe,"I don't know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don't know how you fight that.",8,16
joey,"Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight.  Take a couple deep breaths.  Look confident.",8,16
rachel,Joey? What's up?,8,16
joey,"I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.",8,16
rachel,Okay what's up?,8,16
joey,Here? In the hall? What are we animals?,8,16
rachel,"Well honey, I'm late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?",8,16
joey,"Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I-want to have dinner with you tonight. that is all.",8,16
rachel,Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?,8,16
joey,"Okay. that is good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you are going to say. Good. Yeah.  Don't you people ever knock?!",8,16
monica,I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?,8,16
chandler,"Sure, why don't you set it up. I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals.",8,16
monica,Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.,8,16
chandler,"Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.",8,16
monica,Jeez! What is with you?,8,16
chandler,"I'm sorry, did you say cheese?",8,16
monica,"All right, what's going on?",8,16
chandler,"Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.",8,16
monica,"Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?",8,16
chandler,No. But I'm sure  ‘tomatoes' does.,8,16
monica,I don't believe in soul mates either.,8,16
chandler,You don't?,8,16
monica,No. I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.,8,16
chandler,So you-you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?,8,16
monica,"No, I've had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?",8,16
chandler,I love you.,8,16
monica,I know.,8,16
chandler,You know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers .  No? Really? They taste so good.,8,16

rachel,Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?,8,16
joey,Yeah. Sure.,8,16
rachel,"Huh. Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much.",8,16

joey,Does it really matter?,8,16
rachel,"Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.",8,16
joey,"Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don't have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need.  Okay, you got to say something!",8,16
rachel,"Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I-",8,16
joey,But.,8,16

rachel,"No! Joey please! Please don't! Please don't leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!",8,16
joey,"Don't start doing that. You can't do that Rach, because then you are going to make me do that.  Oh, here we go!",8,16
rachel,Can I?,8,16

waiter,I know! I haven't even read them the specials yet!,8,16
waiter no. 2,What's the matter with them?,8,16

rachel,Joey? Are you in there?,8,17
joey,Oh God! that is Rachel!,8,17
monica,"Joey, you have to talk to her!",8,17

rachel,"Well, at least you make each other laugh.",8,17
monica,What's up?,8,17
rachel,"Well, I haven't seen him since that night that he told me how heyou know-; I don't know, I think he's avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?",8,17
monica,We were playing a game.,8,17
rachel,"Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?",8,17
monica,Sure.,8,17
chandler,What?! No! No!,8,17
rachel,"All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh-;tell him I miss him.",8,17
monica,"Okay, did you hear that?",8,17
joey,"Yeah, a naked bagel game?   Dude, I don't know. that is a pretty small hole.",8,17
monica,"Honey, you got to talk to her.",8,17
joey,I can't!you know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.,8,17
chandler,"I don't know what that is like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, ""I love you,"" was, ""Oh crap!""",8,17
monica,"Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.",8,17
joey,"All right so, so what do I do?",8,17
monica,"This is Rachel. I mean, what are you going to do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it's weird, it's awkward, but you got to at least try.",8,17
joey,Yeah. Okay.  Whoa!  I almost forgot this was on your-;,8,17
chandler,We didn't play it!!,8,17
phoebe,"Okay, so when you are done with your tea I'll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.",8,17
chandler,I didn't know you read tea leaves.,8,17
phoebe,"Oh yeah, I've done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate.you know, and-and you know, one of the great joys of life is it's-it's wondrous unpredictability.you know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.",8,17
monica,"Okay, I'm done. Read mine.",8,17
phoebe,"Okay.  Ooh, I see a ladder.  Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.",8,17
monica,I-I'm the head chef. I-I can't get promoted.,8,17
phoebe,"Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who's next?",8,17
rachel,"Okay, I'm done. Do mine.",8,17
phoebe,"Okay.  Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.",8,17
rachel,Ah.,8,17
phoebe,Oh!  Which can either mean you are having a baby or you are going to make a scientific discovery!,8,17
rachel,"Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.",8,17
chandler,What does yours say Pheebs?,8,17
phoebe,"Umm-; Wow, all right.  Wow! Yay! Ooh, I'm going to meet a guy! And really soon! And he's going to be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.",8,17
ross,"Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It's a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?",8,17
monica,You mean your pink shirt?,8,17
ross,Faded salmon color.,8,17
monica,"No, I-I haven't seen your pink shirt.",8,17
ross,Great! Great. Then I must've left it at Mona's. I knew it!,8,17
chandler,"Well, I'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor's.",8,17
ross,that is my favourite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!,8,17
rachel,Well just ask Mona to give it back!,8,17
ross,"I don't know. I mean I-I guess I could. It's just that we didn't really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.",8,17
phoebe,"Oh wait a second you guys-;for the last couple weeks I've been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy.",8,17
chandler,"Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!  Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?",8,17
rachel,Hi!,8,17
joey,Hey.,8,17
rachel,Hi.,8,17
joey,Hi.,8,17
monica,Tea gives Phoebe the trots.,8,17
rachel,"So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it's not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.",8,17
chandler,"I know it's tough now, but things will get better.",8,17
rachel,"How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can't even be in the same room with each other?!",8,17
chandler,"I'm not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?",8,17
monica,"Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?",8,17
chandler,Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.,8,17
monica,"Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?",8,17
chandler,In the James Taylor case.,8,17
monica,Where is the James Taylor CD?,8,17
chandler,"Honey, I'm going to save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.",8,17
monica,"Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we're just going to have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.",8,17
chandler,"Well, if we're going to do that we should come up with some kind of order. You know alphabetically or by genre?",8,17
monica,"Hmm, I don't know. We really have to talk this through.",8,17
rachel,Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!,8,17
monica,"Okay, I-I'm sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.",8,17
rachel,Oh yeah. That makes sense.,8,17
monica,"Yeah, like I don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.",8,17
rachel,"Ooh, I can do that.",8,17
monica,"Good.  Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?",8,17
chandler,They were just giving those away at the store  in exchange for money.,8,17
joey,Hey!,8,17
rachel,Hi.,8,17
monica,"Uh I really don't know what to tell you Rach, I really don't. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.",8,17
rachel,What?,8,17
monica,"Yeah Joey she's-;Rachel's got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! you know what, if we're going to make dinner we're going to have to leave. Yeah.",8,17

rachel,"I know I told you, it's a really big problem.",8,17
joey,What he wants to buy your baby?!,8,17
rachel,Can you believe that?!,8,17
joey,that is crazy!,8,17
rachel,that is what I told him!,8,17
joey,"Okay, how did this even happen?",8,17
rachel,"Well I'll tell you!  See uh my-my boss and his wife-They-they can't have children. So umm, and that-we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, ""Rachel, I want to buy your baby.""",8,17
joey,Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.,8,17
rachel,OH! Yeah!  Yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.,8,17
phoebe,Oh hello.,8,17
guy,"Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere. I'm Jim, Jim Nelson.",8,17
phoebe,"Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I'm Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.",8,17
jim,"We have. Maybe we'll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o'clock?",8,17
phoebe,"Well, maybe we will.  Oh!",8,17

date,"Oh umm, I-I don't know if I want to wear a woman's shirt.",8,17
mona,No-no that is a man's shirt.,8,17
date,It's awfully pink.,8,17
chandler,"Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.",8,17
monica,"Honey, both yours.",8,17
rachel,Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!,8,17
monica,Yeah? The work problem?,8,17
rachel,Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.,8,17
chandler,What problem did you tell him you had?,8,17
rachel,"Oh that is not important. The point is, I really-I think everything's going to be okay.",8,17
mr. zelner,May I help you?,8,17
joey,Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!,8,17
phoebe,Isn't it funny how we kept running into each other? It's as if someone really wants us to be together.,8,17
jim,Someone does. Me.,8,17
phoebe,"Oh, witty banter. Well done.",8,17

phoebe,Oh stop it.,8,17
jim,And your breasts! Hmm!!!,8,17
phoebe,"Okay. Umm look, you are coming on a little strong. But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don't we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.",8,17
jim,All right.,8,17
phoebe,Okay.,8,17
jim,"I write erotic novels, for children.",8,17

joey,"Don't worry! Don't worry. I just told him, very nicely, ""You don't go buying people's babies, so back off!!""",8,17
rachel,What?!,8,17
chandler and monica,What?!,8,17
rachel,"No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn't want to buy my baby! I made that up!",8,17
joey,What?! Why?!,8,17
rachel,So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn't be awkward!,8,17
joey,And you couldn't think of anything else?!,8,17
monica,You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!,8,17
rachel,I can't believe that you yelled at my boss! I'm-I'm going to lose my job! What am I going to do?!,8,17
chandler,You can always sell your baby.,8,17
rachel,"Oh Joey, I can't believe you brought my boss into this! I'm going to get fired!",8,17
joey,You lied to me!,8,17

rachel,Oh God.,8,17
mr. zelner,"If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby-;I am sorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not mean that I felt that I was due your baby. Yeah, I want to be very clear that I understand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.",8,17
rachel,"Well, as long as we are clear about that.",8,17
phoebe,Oh there it is.,8,17
monica,that is not your regular dry cleaners.,8,17
phoebe,"I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store-;",8,17
monica,What?!,8,17
phoebe,A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that is what they gave me?  When I get up there I'm going to kick some ass.,8,17
monica,"Don't worry Phoebe, you are going to meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.",8,17
phoebe,"Yeah, we both can. And we both will.",8,17
phoebe,"Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.",8,17
monica,Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I'm-I'm going to be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.,8,17
phoebe,Okay.,8,17
guy,"Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s-; Wow!",8,17
phoebe,What?,8,17
guy,"I'm sorry, it's just that you are so incredibly beautiful.",8,17
phoebe,"Oh yeah well, I'm sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?",8,17
guy,"I hope you don't think I'm crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?",8,17
phoebe,A little.   Now you are talking.,8,17
guy,Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?,8,17
phoebe,I-I-I'd love to. Let me just tell my friend.,8,17
monica,"Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?",8,17
phoebe,She must've left.,8,17
rachel,Hi.,8,17
joey,So? What-what-what happened?,8,17
rachel,It's all going to be okay. They're just so happy that I'm not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.,8,17
chandler,"Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they're not in the baby buying business.",8,17
rachel,"Chandler, can you give us a minute?",8,17
chandler,"Oh I'm sorry, you are kicking me out of my own living room?",8,17
rachel,Yeah.,8,17

rachel,"Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things-;",8,17
joey,I know. I know.,8,17
rachel,"It kind of worked. I mean you know, I don't know about you buy I haven't thought about our thing since all this.",8,17
joey,"Hey you are right. Yeah, it's kind of been like us again a little bit.",8,17
rachel,Yeah I know! I miss that.,8,17
joey,Me too. I mean I-;haven't thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn't feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.,8,17
rachel,My gynaecologist tried to kill me.,8,17
ross,"Item J437-A, colour",8,17
mona,"Listen Ross, you don't have to apologize. I understand why you were there.",8,17
ross,You do?,8,17
mona,"Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can't. It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just-; It just wasn't meant to be.",8,17
ross,Oh God you are right.,8,17
mona,"Ross, we-;we have to be strong. Okay, I-I'm going to go.  Can I? To remember you?",8,17
ross,No.,8,17
phoebe,"Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent's anniversary party?",8,18
monica,Yeah.,8,18
ross,Sure. Yeah.,8,18

phoebe,"Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.",8,18
chandler,"Ooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers?  Who said that?",8,18
phoebe,"Yeah, he's really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.",8,18
monica,"Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?",8,18
ross,"Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?",8,18
monica,"Yeah, I'd really like to.",8,18
ross,"Okay, hopefully this time mom won't boo you.",8,18
monica,"Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I'm going to make them cry.",8,18
chandler,And you wonder why Ross is their favourite?,8,18
monica,"No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, ""God, your brother."" Know what they'll say this year? ""God, you""",8,18
joey,"Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying.  I'm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue.",8,18
monica,Really you can do that?,8,18
joey,Are you kidding me? Watch!  Well I can't do it with you guys watching me!,8,18
chandler,What are you doing?,8,18
monica,"Oh I'm working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.",8,18

monica,You got a present for my parents. that is so sweet.,8,18
joey,"Yeah, yeah, in honour of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.",8,18
ross,Aww that is so cool.,8,18
joey,And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.,8,18
rachel,"Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?",8,18
chandler,"Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt,  and I think my testacles may be in here too.",8,18
ross,"Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! You know Monica couldn't get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.",8,18
monica,What?!,8,18
ross,You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!,8,18
phoebe,Hey!,8,18
all,Hi!,8,18
phoebe,"Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is-",8,18

ross,"Ah, actually, I'm sorry we-we probably should get going.",8,18
parker,"Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I?",8,18
rachel,"I, uh, think you already are.",8,18
parker,"Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this world more miraculous than-Oh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?",8,18
monica,that is my old dog. He passed away years ago.,8,18
parker,"Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend, bow-wow. So where's the party?",8,18
monica,It's out on the island. It's in Massapequa.,8,18
parker,"Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is it steep in Native American history? {Transcriber's Note",8,18
ross,"Well, there is an Arby's in the shape of a tee-pee.",8,18
monica,"Okay, I got my note cards.  Do you got the presents?",8,18
chandler,Yeah.,8,18
monica,And I've got the car keys.,8,18
parker,We're driving!?,8,18
monica,Yeah.,8,18
parker,Aces!,8,18
ross,"So uh, he seems like a nice guy.",8,18
rachel,"Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.",8,18
ross,You want to hang back and take our own cab?,8,18
rachel,"Yeah, otherwise I'm not going.",8,18
mr. and mrs. geller,Hi,8,18
ross,Hi!  Hey mom.,8,18
rachel,"This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?",8,18
mrs. geller,Jack?,8,18
mr. geller,Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?,8,18
ross,"that is a good question, dad. that is a good question-",8,18
rachel,Hmmm-.,8,18
woman,Congratulations you two!,8,18
rachel,Thank you-we're so excited,8,18
woman,"And also, congratulations on your wedding.",8,18
ross,Wha-What?,8,18
mrs. geller,"Can we talk to you for just you know- It's just a little thing. Well we think it's absolutely marvellous that you are having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we've told them all that you are married.",8,18
ross and rachel,What?!,8,18
mrs. geller,Thanks for going along with this.,8,18
ross,Dad so what we have to pretend that we're married?,8,18
mr. geller,"Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.",8,18
ross,Can you believe that?,8,18
rachel,"Yeah, if you are going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nasal area.",8,18
ross,"No, us having to lie about being married.",8,18
rachel,"No, I know I don't either, but you know what, it's their party, and it's just one night. And we don't even have to lie; we just won't say anything. If it comes up again, we'll just-smile. We'll nod along.",8,18
woman,Ross!,8,18
man,Rachel!,8,18
ross,"Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan",8,18
aunt lisa,"Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding",8,18
ross and rachel,Hmm-.,8,18
uncle dan,Here's a little something to get you started.,8,18
rachel,Oh-,8,18
aunt lisa,"So, how's married life treating you?",8,18
rachel,Unbelievable!,8,18
ross,We love marriage!,8,18
aunt lisa,Great!,8,18
ross,Hey,8,18
phoebe,Hey!,8,18
parker,"What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room C-I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I don't want to forget this moment! It's like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click!",8,18
chandler,I don't think the flash went off.,8,18
parker,"Dahaaa!  I'm going to find the men's room, be right back.",8,18
phoebe,I'll go with you,8,18
parker,Come on!,8,18
chandler,Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.,8,18
joey,"I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing.",8,18
ross,I'm so we weren't in the car! Did he ever let up?,8,18
monica,He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.,8,18
ross,This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture!  Ooh sorry-,8,18
phoebe,Were you guys making fun of Parker?,8,18
ross,"That depends, how much did you hear?",8,18
phoebe,"So, he a little enthusiastic, what's wrong with that?",8,18
monica,"It's just that, it's so much.",8,18
phoebe,"Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you've dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don't do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? Because in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who's who of human crap.",8,18
monica,I feel terrible.,8,18
joey,I know,8,18
ross,What was wrong with Mona?,8,18
rachel,Open it! Open it! Open it!,8,18
ross,Yeah baby!,8,18
man,So we never got to hear about your wedding!,8,18
woman,We were surprise that we weren't invited.,8,18
ross,"No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.",8,18
rachel,"But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.",8,18
man,Where did you have it?,8,18
rachel,"On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn't She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.",8,18
woman,Really?,8,18
rachel,"Yeah, Stevie's an old family friend.",8,18
woman,Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.,8,18
rachel,So would I. You wouldn't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.,8,18
ross,Would you excuse us for a second?  Umm-. what are you doing?,8,18
rachel,What? I'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.,8,18
ross,"Okay, okay. Ooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.",8,18
rachel,"Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.",8,18
parker,Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.,8,18
phoebe,"No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.",8,18
parker,And I'm with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this plate-bouncy thing.  What an inspired solution to man's plate dispensing problems.,8,18
phoebe,"Hm huh, yeah.",8,18
parker,Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.,8,18
phoebe,"No, that is not necessary.",8,18
parker,Please.,8,18
phoebe,"No, actually I don't eat-",8,18
parker,I won't quit until you try.,8,18
phoebe,"Okay, fine! Fine!  Mmm-hmm-.",8,18
parker,What are they like? I've never had one.,8,18
phoebe,Why don't you just try one?,8,18
parker,"No, they look too weird.",8,18
chandler,What are you doin'?,8,18
monica,Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit them. I can't wait. They're going to be crying so hard. They're going to be fighting for breath.,8,18
chandler,"You know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .",8,18
rachel,"And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.",8,18
woman,Blind?,8,18
rachel,"Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.",8,18
aunt lisa,I'll bet you looked beautiful-,8,18
rachel,"Well, I don't know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.",8,18
woman,"So, how did you propose?",8,18
rachel,Oh yeah. that is a great story.,8,18
ross,"Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. that is-that is where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favourite flower-",8,18
aunt lisa,Oh that is so sweet!,8,18
rachel,Shh! I want to hear the rest!,8,18
ross,"Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words ""Will you marry me?""",8,18
rachel,"And the ring, was the size of my fist !",8,18
joey,"Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him.",8,18
phoebe,Then you better do it now.,8,18
joey,Why?,8,18
phoebe,Because I'm going to kill him,8,18
joey,What-what?,8,18
phoebe,"You guys were right. He's just too excited about-everything. I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary. Okay? Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks.",8,18
joey,"I know I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!",8,18
phoebe,Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?,8,18
joey,"I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. you know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there.",8,18
phoebe,He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him.,8,18
joey,"Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy.",8,18
phoebe,You think?,8,18
joey,Yeah. You know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.,8,18
phoebe,"you are right. you are right, he's just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person.",8,18
joey,"Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.",8,18
phoebe,What's that now?,8,18
joey,Nothing-,8,18
phoebe,Oh look it's Parker!,8,18
parker,Look! It's the bunny hop!,8,18
phoebe,Ooh I love it!,8,18
parker,You do?!,8,18
phoebe,Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!,8,18
monica,"Okay it's time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it.",8,18
monica,"No, no it's going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don't say it enough, but I love you.  When I look around this room, I'm-I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can't because she's dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. . Was.  Do me a favour and pass this to my parents. Remember she's dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment?  Didn't see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love.  You people are made of stone! Here's to mom and dad! Whatever!",8,18
mrs. geller,"Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn't it interesting, Jack?",8,18
mr. geller,Why don't I remember this dog?,8,18
mrs. geller,"Ross, why don't you give us your toast now?",8,18
ross,"Oh, no, Mom, it's just Monica this year.",8,18
mrs. geller,you are not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary,8,18
ross,"No, of course, Um- Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say-on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if-if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.",8,18
mrs. geller,Oh Ross-,8,18
mr. geller,I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross's toast.,8,18
parker,My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!,8,18
phoebe,Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?,8,18
parker,"I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words-",8,18
phoebe,Oh thank God.,8,18
parker,It's a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst-,8,18
phoebe,"Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!",8,18
parker,That sounds great.  My God this is the most comfortable couch I've ever sat on in my entire life.,8,18
phoebe,"Let's try something else, let's play a game.",8,18
parker,I love games!,8,18
phoebe,Shocking! Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.,8,18
parker,Or-Jenga.,8,18
phoebe,"But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!",8,18
parker,"I lose, now Jenga.",8,18
phoebe,Oh my God! Oh my God!,8,18
parker,Is something wrong?,8,18
phoebe,"Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!",8,18
parker,"Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!",8,18
phoebe,You don't have to put a good spin on everything.,8,18
parker,I'm sorry that is who I am. I'm a positive person.,8,18
phoebe,"No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!",8,18
parker,"So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?",8,18
phoebe,Much less happy!,8,18
parker,"Fine! Well then to quote Ross, ""I'd better be going.""",8,18
phoebe,So long! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!,8,18
parker,Isn't this the most incredible fight you've ever had in your entire life?,8,18
phoebe,Uh huh.,8,18
ross,"-and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!",8,18
rachel,"Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.",8,18
ross,But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?,8,18
rachel,It was really fun being married to you tonight.,8,18
ross,"Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.",8,18
rachel,"Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?",8,18
ross,Yeah.,8,18
rachel,"That proposal, at the planetarium-",8,18
ross,"I know, I know it was stupid.",8,18
rachel,"Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was-really wonderful! Did you just make that up?",8,18
ross,"No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.",8,18
rachel,"Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.",8,18
ross,"It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night",8,18
rachel,Goodnight,8,18
ross,Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?,8,18
rachel,I will think about it.,8,18
ross,that is all I'm asking',8,18
monica,"Okay that is it. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you are the one giving the speech.",8,18
ross,You know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.,8,18
monica,"Oh, come on.",8,18
ross,"Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. OH, yeah she really would've wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.",8,18
monica,"Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?",8,18
rachel,Hi!,8,19
ross,Hey!,8,19
monica,Hey!,8,19
rachel,"So, I'm in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down.",8,19
joey,"Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. that is me!! I'm blank!!",8,19
monica,How cool is this?! We know three down! I'm touching three down!,8,19
joey,Yeah you are baby.,8,19
monica,"Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?",8,19
rachel,So did they call you to tell you your name's going to be in this?,8,19
joey,"No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.",8,19
ross,Why'd you say no?,8,19
joey,"Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.",8,19
chandler,If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.,8,19
rachel,"Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plusyou know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green?",8,19
chandler,Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?,8,19
rachel,"Okay, don't listen to him. Please?",8,19
joey,"Fine! All right, I'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I you know, start to say something stupid.",8,19
ross,"Just then or-or all the time, Because we-we have jobs you know.",8,19
rachel,"Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green.  Ha-ha! I'm going to be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle.  Seriously, proud of you.",8,19
joey,Yeah.,8,19
the interviewer,I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.,8,19
joey,"Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.",8,19
monica,You think we're being obvious?,8,19
chandler,"No, we're just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.",8,19
the interviewer,You know I think its great you wanted to meet here. you know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.,8,19
joey,"Actually, I didn't know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn't have mattered, I'm doing this for the fans, not for the free food.",8,19
gunther,Can I get you anything?,8,19
the interviewer,"Umm, I'll have a cup of coffee.",8,19
joey,And I'll have all the muffins.,8,19
phoebe,Hey!,8,19
ross,Shh! We're not talking.,8,19
phoebe,Oh. Finally! Oh.,8,19
the interviewer,"So, according to your bio, you've done quite a bit of work before Days of Our Lives. Anything you are particularly proud of?",8,19
joey,,8,19
host,"Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flinging'-flanging' hard to open.",8,19
joey,"Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!",8,19
mike,And there is Kevin.,8,19
mike,"This is the first time he's ever used this product, he's never used this product before, you are going to see how easy this is to do.  Go ahead.  This works with any milk carton.",8,19
joey,"Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.",8,19
lauren,So this is it? Victor?,8,19
joey,"Yeah, I guess it is. And so- I'm going to get on this spaceship,  and I'm going to go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all.  So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne- baby-I'm going to want to meet her.",8,19
joey,"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm coming' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinking' what do I do, what do I do-so I just watch them have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line,  you know that is bad for the paper tray.",8,19
chandler,Nice work my friend.,8,19
joey,"Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am-",8,19
joey,"Well, there are so many things, it's hard to pick just one.",8,19

rachel,That is the Coast Guard.,8,19
joey,What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.,8,19
chandler,Hey!,8,19
phoebe,Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!,8,19
joey,Dude! What are you-you trying to kill me?!,8,19
chandler,"Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?",8,19
ross,"Come on, it's fun!",8,19
chandler,All right!  Isn't this a woman's hat?,8,19
joey,"Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!",8,19
chandler,"You know what, we have to turn off the porn.",8,19

the interviewer,A mento-,8,19
joey,Right.,8,19
the interviewer,Like the candy?,8,19
joey,"Matter of fact, I do.",8,19
the interviewer,"Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?",8,19
joey,"Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.",8,19
joey,"Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?",8,19
ross,Are you serious?!,8,19
joey,Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything Because I didn't want to jinx it.,8,19
ross,Wow! We are pretty good at this!,8,19

joey,"Oh, I-I, I think that is the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",8,19
chandler,What's wrong with you?,8,19
joey,"Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.",8,19
chandler,This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you-Go to the doctor!,8,19
joey,"No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's going to be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!  Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!",8,19
rachel,"It's a trifle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",8,19
ross,It tastes like feet!,8,19
joey,I like it.,8,19
ross,Are you kidding?,8,19
joey,What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Good.,8,19

rachel,"What?! You mean they're not coming to a social event where there's no men and there's no booze?! that is shocking! I don't care, as long as my mom's here.",8,20
monica,"Oh my God, your mother!",8,20
rachel,What?! My mom's not going to be here?!,8,20
monica,"Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.",8,20
rachel,My God!,8,20
monica,"Well it wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!",8,20
phoebe,"Well I don't, I don't have a mother so often I forget that other people-",8,20

phoebe,"I know. I know, what's her number?",8,20
rachel,I don't know.,8,20
monica,"Go! I have it in my book. Go!   Wait a minute! If you are in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her-Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica Geller.",8,20
mrs. green,"Oh, hello Monica.",8,20
monica,"Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we've decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.",8,20
mrs. green,"I know, my daughter's told me about it when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.",8,20
monica,"Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.",8,20
mrs. green,For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?,8,20
monica,"Oh my God, my ass is sweating!  Please! Please! Can you come? It's today at four.",8,20
mrs. green,Well all right. I'll see you at four.,8,20

joey,"Yeah, isn't that a cool name?",8,20
ross,Yeah!,8,20
chandler,No!,8,20
joey,"All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don't you tell us a little something about you Ross?",8,20
ross,"Well uh, I-I'm a palaeontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben!  And uh-",8,20
joey,"I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?",8,20
chandler,"Well Joey, I'm a head-hunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!",8,20
joey,"Excellent! Let's play Bamboozled! Chandler, you'll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?",8,20
chandler,Bogota.,8,20
joey,"It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.",8,20
chandler,What does a Wicked Wango card do?,8,20
joey,"I should know that. Let's see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.",8,20
chandler,Higher or lower than what?,8,20
joey,This is embarrassing.,8,20
chandler,Can you believe how lame this is?,8,20
ross,"I'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.",8,20
phoebe,"Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. that is good right?",8,20
monica,You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!,8,20
phoebe,What? He's going to be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!,8,20
monica,Hi!,8,20
phoebe,I'm so glad you could make it.,8,20

mrs. green,Try. There's my little girl.,8,20
monica,She's still mad.,8,20
phoebe,Yeah I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.,8,20
monica,"Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?",8,20
phoebe,"No look, we've apologized twice! I can't do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.",8,20
monica,Okay. I can do that.  I got to go powder my ass.,8,20
mrs. green,"Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didn't know better I'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, let's get some tea.",8,20
rachel,Okay.,8,20
mrs. green,"Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? Now I don't want you to use your housekeeper Because it would just split her focus.",8,20
rachel,"Oh well actually going to use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.",8,20
mrs. green,"It's like you are a cave person. Rachel, you must get a nanny. You don't know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.",8,20
rachel,"Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca.",8,20
mrs. green,Such a sweet woman.,8,20
rachel,"Well, however great she was I just can't afford that.",8,20
mrs. green,Oh Rachel!,8,20
rachel,What?,8,20
mrs. green,I just had the greatest idea! I'm going to come live with you!,8,20
rachel,Wh-wh-what? What?,8,20
mrs. green,"Oh, I'm so happy I'm going to do this for my little girl. Aw, look at you. You have tears in your eyes.",8,20
rachel,Yes. Yes I do.,8,20
joey,"All right Ross you are in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?",8,20
ross,"The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I'll take another question.",8,20
joey,"Okay, this is going to be tough. Hold your breath.",8,20
ross,"It's okay, I'm ready.",8,20
joey,"No dude, you got to hold your breath until you are ready to answer the question.",8,20
chandler,"This is ridiculous, he's not going to hold his breath-",8,20
joey,"Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris-Holy cow, that is a big word. Trisc- Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?",8,20
chandler,Let me see that.,8,20
joey,This one right here.,8,20
chandler,Triscadecaphobia.,8,20
ross,The fear of Triscuts!,8,20
joey,"No! No, fear of the number 13.",8,20
chandler,Fear of Triscuts?,8,20
ross,"It's possible, they have really sharp edges.",8,20
joey,"All right Chandler, you are up.",8,20
ross,"Wait a minute, I-I believe I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?",8,20
chandler,This game makes no sense!,8,20
ross,You know what? you are just upset because you are losing.,8,20
chandler,"Oh come on Ross, I think we're all losers here.",8,20
joey,"All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.",8,20
chandler,Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I don't care.,8,20
joey,You-you must choose Mr. Bing.,8,20
chandler,"Either, it makes no difference.",8,20
joey,"Choose, you jackass!",8,20
chandler,I'll take a card.,8,20
joey,"Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross's points!",8,20
ross,What?!,8,20
chandler,This game is kind of fun.,8,20
ross,You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just Because you-,8,20
chandler,I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.,8,20
rachel,Why did you invite my mother?!,8,20
monica,What?,8,20
rachel,She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.,8,20
phoebe,For how long?,8,20
rachel,"Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.",8,20
monica,I personally would be honoured if she wanted to live with me.,8,20
phoebe,She can't hear you.,8,20
rachel,"What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?",8,20
phoebe,"Well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.",8,20
rachel,"you are right. you are right. I mean I'm about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don't want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She's going to want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!",8,20
monica,"that is right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don't want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!",8,20
rachel,Okay.,8,20
monica,This is great! Now she's going to be mad at Rachel! You know what? And I'm just going to swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.,8,20
phoebe,I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It's time to open the presents!,8,20
monica,"Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you are the most important person in this room. And in the world!",8,20
mrs. green,"Well uh, I don't have a gift because I wasn't invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone's attention.",8,20
phoebe,"How about you less important people, let's open your presents!",8,20
rachel,Mom that is okay that you didn't get you a gift!,8,20
mrs. green,"Well, I kind of did. Me. Eight weeks of me.",8,20
rachel,"Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.",8,20
mrs. green,"Sweetheart I know you are going to be terrific mom, I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.",8,20
rachel,"But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.",8,20
mrs. green,Really? Remember Twinkles?,8,20
rachel,He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!,8,20
phoebe,"Okay, come on Rach it's present time! You know you are the glue that is holding this whole party together. It's kind of falling apart here.",8,20
mrs. green,Oh look.,8,20
rachel,Wow!,8,20
phoebe,"Okay, this is from your friend at work.",8,20
rachel,"Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is!  Wait a minute. That can't be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?",8,20
mrs. green,"Darling, that is a breast pump!",8,20
rachel,"Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What's this?",8,20
woman,It's a diaper genie.,8,20
rachel,"Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!",8,20
woman,No! It's where you put the dirty ones!,8,20
rachel,"Well that is gross, why don't you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?",8,20
mrs. green,Oh you are going to do that ten times a day?,8,20
rachel,What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!,8,20
mrs. green,"No dear, that is what babies do.",8,20
monica,"Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.",8,20
mrs. green,"Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you are trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?",8,20
rachel,"I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table?  What?! What'd I do? What'd I do?!",8,20
mrs. green,You can't leave a baby alone!,8,20
rachel,"Oh come--Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would-she wouldn't be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. You know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I'm just going to maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.",8,20
woman,It's actually a bassinet.,8,20
rachel,"Okay mommy, don't ever leave me.",8,20
joey,"In what John Houston film would you hear this line, ""Badges? We don't need no stinking' badges!""",8,20

ross,"What-you are not serious. I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She'll drive us totally crazy.",8,20
mrs. green,Hi Ross!,8,20
ross,Hi roomie!,8,20
man,"Hey Joey, hi! I'm Ray; I'm the producer of the show.",8,20
joey,It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.,8,20
ray,"And this is Duncan  and Erin, they're going to help us out with the audition. So uh, let's get the camera rolling.",8,20
joey,Rightie-O Ray!,8,20
ray,Whenever you are ready.,8,20
joey,"Hello, I'm Joey Tribbiani! Let's play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?",8,20
erin,Wayne Gretzky.,8,20
joey,"Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?",8,20
ray,"Uh Joey, didn't your agents give you the revised rules? We've eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.",8,20
joey,What-Why?!,8,20
ray,"Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn't follow it.",8,20
joey,Well what's complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! you are in Paradise Pond!,8,20
ray,Yeah all that is gone. It's basically just a simple question and answer game now.,8,20
joey,Well what's fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that is just people standing around answering questions?,8,20
ray,"Well, there'll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.",8,20
joey,Let's play Bamboozled!,8,20
mrs. green,#NAME?,8,20
ross,Well we-we don't have a garage.,8,20
mrs. green,Did I say garage? I meant garbage.,8,20
ross,"You know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it's not absolutely vital that you live with us.",8,20
mrs. green,Well Rachel needs help with the baby.,8,20
rachel,I do. I really do. I don't know anything.,8,20
ross,I'm-I'm sure that is not true.,8,20
rachel,Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?,8,20
phoebe,"No, not a thing.",8,20
monica,It's frightening.,8,20
ross,"Well uh, you know what? Even if she doesn't know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn't live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.",8,20
mrs. green,that is true. You do have another child.,8,20
ross,Yeah.,8,20
mrs. green,With another woman. Have you no control Ross?,8,20
ross,"that is a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to-to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.",8,20
mrs. green,Well then you really don't need me to live with you.,8,20
ross,"Yes! Yes, you are going to be so missed.",8,20
mrs. green,you are going to be a great father.,8,20
ross,Well you are going to be a wonderful grandma.,8,20
rachel,Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!,8,20
ross,"Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You'll-you are going to pick it up.  Hey! You will! Uh look, you know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?",8,20
rachel,I hope you are going somewhere with this.,8,20
ross,Look at you! What-you are-you are this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you are going to be an incredible mother.,8,20
rachel,Really?,8,20
ross,I'm telling you.,8,20
rachel,Thank you.,8,20
mrs. green,"All right you two, I'm going to get going.",8,20
ross,Oh.,8,20
mrs. green,"Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I'll let myself out. It's like I'm not here, which I almost wasn't.",8,20
monica,you are still so funny. you are so funny.  What do I do?,8,20
phoebe,"Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it.",8,20
monica,You know what? you are-you are right.,8,20
phoebe,"Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I'd tell her off.",8,20
monica,Really?,8,20
phoebe,Uh-huh!,8,20
monica,"Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green!  It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose! But what you are during to me now is just plain spiteful!",8,20
mrs. green,Spiteful?!,8,20
monica,that is right! Maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady-old lady-lady!,8,20
phoebe,"Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up-",8,20
monica,"So whenever you are ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day!  I can't feel my legs!",8,20
phoebe,You were fantastic! I'm so proud of you!,8,20
monica,Yeah? I'm proud of me too.,8,20
phoebe,You should be!,8,20
monica,Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?,8,20
phoebe,You got it!,8,20
monica,"Okay.  Mrs. Green! Okay I'm really sorry!! I'm apologizing for the-  Okay, I bit my tongue, but I'm still really sorry!",8,20
rachel,Okay! I'm ready.,8,20
ross,You sure?,8,20
rachel,"Yes, I've done my studying and I really know my stuff.",8,20
ross,All right then.  Rachel Green! Let's play Bamboozled!  How do you test the temperature of the baby's bath water?,8,20
rachel,"Uh, put your elbow in it.",8,20
ross,Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?,8,20
rachel,"Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.",8,20
ross,"that is correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?",8,20
rachel,"Check if it's wet, check if it's hungry, burp it!",8,20
ross,"Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?",8,20
rachel,A card! A card! I pick a card!,8,20
ross,"Oh, I'm sorry you've been Bamboozled! you are going to be a terrible mother!  I've lost sight of why we're doing this!",8,20
ross,Hey you guys I got some bad news.,8,21
phoebe,"Well that is no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, ""Extra! Extra! Read all about it!""",8,21
ross,"No, Monica's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.  I didn't want her to see it, so I ran around the neighbourhood and bought all the copies I could find.",8,21
joey,"Man, this is bad! And I've had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though.  ""Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal.""",8,21
monica,Hey!,8,21
chandler,Hey.,8,21
monica,Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!,8,21
ross,Umm-,8,21
monica,Oh dear God!,8,21
ross,"But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.",8,21
monica,What about the rest of Manhattan?!,8,21
ross,"Yeah, they all know.",8,21
monica,"Oh my God, this is horrible!",8,21
chandler,I'm so sorry.,8,21
monica,I'm so humiliated!,8,21
rachel,"Yeah but you know what they say Mon, ""There's no such thing as bad press.""",8,21
monica,"You don't think that umm,  ""The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful,"" is bad press?",8,21
rachel,I didn't write it.,8,21
monica,Is he right? Am I really-Am I awful?,8,21

rachel,"No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!",8,21
ross,It's funny you should mention diapers.,8,21
rachel,I'm serious.,8,21
ross,"Okay look, there's nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There's a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?",8,21
rachel,Okay. Thank you. that is great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this really cute shoe store that has like this little-,8,21

rachel,"Oh, wait Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing!",8,21
ross,Yeah!,8,21
rachel,"Umm, our situation. You know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we're having this baby together, and we live together. Isn't that, isn't that weird?",8,21
ross,Well uh-,8,21
rachel,I'm just kidding! You can go pee!,8,21
joey,"Hey uh Monica, I can't remember. Did we say we were going to meet here or at the movies?",8,21

joey,"Okay, I'll see you there.",8,21
monica,Joey!  Now that you are here-,8,21
joey,"Sure, I can hang out 'til I have to meet you.  What uh-How come you are not going?",8,21
chandler,I have a job interview I have to get ready for.,8,21
joey,I thought you already have a job.,8,21
chandler,"And people say you don't pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.",8,21
joey,Wow! How do you know how to do that?!,8,21
chandler,that is what I do now.,8,21
monica,"Hey Joey, come taste this.",8,21
joey,What is it?,8,21
monica,Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well-  I'm getting my revenge!,8,21
joey,You cooked him?,8,21
monica,"No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I want to go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! ""Restaurant reviewer admits",8,21
chandler,"The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't you?",8,21

rachel,Oh.,8,21
ross,Oh.,8,21
rachel,"No-no-no! No, no, no, we're not married.",8,21
ross,"We are having a baby together, but we're not involved.  I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night.  Or, yes stranger, we'd like this delivered please.",8,21
cashier,Why don't you fill out this address card.,8,21
ross,"Oh, okay.",8,21
cashier,I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.,8,21
rachel,"Oh yeah! Actually, that is one of the reasons why we're not a couple.",8,21
ross,"I chose those, I'm a palaeontologist.",8,21
cashier,Really?! That is so cool!,8,21
rachel,"Oh. Oh yeah, don't get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not.",8,21
cashier,"Oh no-no, I'm fascinated by palaeontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?",8,21
ross,Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.,8,21
rachel,"Oh my God! I'm standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I'm bored.",8,21
cashier,"Oh, I love your neighbourhood. There's a great gym right around the corner from your building.",8,21
ross,that is my gym.,8,21
cashier,"I can tell you work out.  A palaeontologist who works out, you are like Indiana Jones.",8,21
ross,I am like Indiana Jones.,8,21
rachel,Hi Pheebs!,8,21
phoebe,"Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?",8,21
rachel,"Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasn't on the list. A whore.",8,21
phoebe,What?!,8,21
rachel,"Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.",8,21
phoebe,Well did she know you two weren't married?,8,21
rachel,Yeah.,8,21
phoebe,"Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!",8,21
rachel,You don't understand! You didn't see how brazen she was.,8,21
phoebe,Sounds like you are a little jealous.,8,21
rachel,No! I'm not! I-I-I just think it's wrong! It's-it's that I'm-Here I am about to pop and he's out picking up some shop girl at Sluts 'R' Us!,8,21
phoebe,Is that a real place?  Are they hiring?,8,21
chandler,Hey Phoebe!  Fatty!,8,21
phoebe,"Hey Chandler, why so fancy?",8,21
chandler,"Well, I got a job interview. It's kind of a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.",8,21
phoebe,"Wait, I think I know someone who does that.",8,21
chandler,"Me! I do that. So- Seriously, do I look okay? I'm little nervous.",8,21
rachel,Oh yeah! You really-You look great.,8,21
phoebe,"Yeah, just don't get your hopes up.",8,21
chandler,Why not?,8,21
phoebe,"Well, the interview-",8,21

phoebe,You know! You don't make a very good first impression.,8,21
chandler,What?!,8,21
phoebe,Oh you don't know.,8,21
chandler,Are you serious?!,8,21
phoebe,"Yes, when I first met you, you were like, ""Blah, blah, blah."" I was like, shh!",8,21
chandler,What is it that I do?,8,21
phoebe,"Well it's just like you are trying too hard. Always making jokes, you know, you just-You come off a little needy.",8,21
chandler,Did you like me when we first met?,8,21
rachel,"Chandler, I'm not going to lie to you, but I am going to run away from you.",8,21
monica,"Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.",8,21
the food critic,Still?,8,21
monica,"I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.",8,21
the food critic,I don't see any reason why I would do that to myself again.,8,21
joey,"Either eat it, or be in it.",8,21
monica,"Spoon?  So, what do you think?",8,21
the food critic,"I'm torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.",8,21
joey,Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there's a new class coming' in.,8,21
the cooking teacher,"Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?",8,21
monica,I can.,8,21
the cooking teacher,"Okay, go ahead.",8,21
monica,"Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.",8,21
the cooking teacher,"that is very good, what's your name?",8,21
monica,Monica.,8,21
the cooking teacher,"Monica, you go to the head of the class.",8,21

ross,"My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here?",8,21
katie,"Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.",8,21
ross,"Ah, must've been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.",8,21
katie,"Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.",8,21
ross,Oh.,8,21
katie,Oh uh-I actually came here to ask you out.,8,21
ross,"Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I'm just going to put this  back in my pocket, pretend that didn't happen. Uh yeah, actually I'm free now. Do you want to grab some coffee or-",8,21

phoebe,"Oh! It's okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.",8,21
chandler,"Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is going to last a couple of weeks.",8,21
phoebe,"All right, don't freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?",8,21
chandler,An hour.,8,21
phoebe,I can't help you.,8,21
chandler,Phoebe!,8,21
phoebe,"All right, all right, we'll just do our best. Okay? So let's say I'm the interviewer and I'm meeting you for the first time. Okay. ""Hi! Come on in, I'm uh, Regina Phalange.""",8,21
chandler,Chandler Bing.,8,21
phoebe,"Bing, what an unusual name.",8,21
chandler,"Well you should meet my uncle, Bada.  I'll let myself out.",8,21
joey,Hi.,8,21
the cooking teacher,"Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?",8,21
joey,"When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?",8,21
the cooking teacher,And the cream?,8,21
joey,Cheese makes me thirsty.,8,21
the cooking teacher,Okay. Let's move on.,8,21

the cooking teacher,Oh! Something smells good over at Monica's station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You've never made this before?,8,21
monica,"Oh no! I don't know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.",8,21
the cooking teacher,"Well, hats off to the chef.",8,21
monica,"I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?",8,21
the cooking teacher,The chef!,8,21
monica,that is right.,8,21
chandler,"-I think you'll find if I come to work here, I don't micro-manage. I don't shy away from delegating.",8,21
phoebe,"Um-hmm, that is good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do.",8,21
chandler,"What I do do-is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.",8,21
phoebe,I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.,8,21
chandler,Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.,8,21
phoebe,You got to go!,8,21
chandler,Oh!,8,21
phoebe,"Okay, don't worry. you are ready.",8,21

chandler,Okay.,8,21
the cooking teacher,"Ah Monica, my star student.",8,21

the cooking teacher,I think you should give him your star.,8,21
monica,Excuse me? He doesn't even know what he's doing!,8,21
the cooking teacher,We're all beginners here. Nobody knows what they're doing.,8,21
monica,I do! I'm a professional chef!  Oh relax! It's not a courtroom drama!,8,21
the cooking teacher,"If you are a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?",8,21

joey,"Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go.",8,21
chandler,-also I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.,8,21
the interviewer,You must've had your hands full.,8,21
chandler,That I did. That I did.,8,21
the interviewer,So let's talk a little bit about your duties.,8,21
chandler,My duties?  All right.,8,21
the interviewer,"Now you'll be heading a whole division, so you'll have a lot of duties.",8,21
chandler,I see.,8,21
the interviewer,But there'll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.,8,21
chandler,Good to know.,8,21
the interviewer,We can go into detail-,8,21
chandler,No don't I beg of you!,8,21
the interviewer,"All right then, we'll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here.",8,21
chandler,Really?!,8,21
the interviewer,Absolutely.  You can relax; you did great.,8,21
chandler,"Yeah I got to say thank you, I was really nervous. You know I've been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing.  Duties.  Duties!  Poo.",8,21
the interviewer,Poo?,8,21
chandler,"Oh my God this doesn't count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!",8,21
the interviewer,Poo?!,8,21

ross,Hey.,8,21
rachel,Hi! you are back from your date!,8,21
ross,How are you?,8,21
rachel,"I'm fine, but that is not important. What's important is how was she?",8,21
ross,"Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.",8,21
rachel,"Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.",8,21
ross,"What's uh, what's going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?",8,21
rachel,"No! No, she's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't?",8,21
ross,I liked her.,8,21
rachel,"Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!",8,21
ross,Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!,8,21
rachel,"No! It's just that, Kate bothered me.",8,21
ross,Why? What was wrong with her?,8,21
rachel,There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!,8,21
ross,"Okay, so what's the matter?",8,21
rachel,I don't want you to date her!,8,21
ross,"Why? What, what are you jealous?",8,21
rachel,"Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don't want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.",8,21

rachel,"Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you.",8,21

rachel,Right!,8,21
joey,"Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that is the first A I've gotten since seventh grade, and I didn't have to sleep with the teacher this time.",8,21
monica,"Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?",8,21
joey,What the hell!,8,21
monica,Okay.,8,21
the acting teacher,"All right, let's start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?",8,21
joey,"Yeah, this was a stupid idea.",8,21
ross,Hey! What are you guys looking at?,8,22
joey,"Oh, it's a poster for that World War I movie that I'm in, check it out.",8,22
ross,Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!,8,22
joey,Uh-huh! I know. I'm coming soon to a theatre near you! I'm in THX! I'm unsuitable for children!,8,22
ross,Now I cannot wait to see this.,8,22
joey,"Yeah, yeah, it's already generating Oscar buzz.",8,22
phoebe,I started that!,8,22
joey,I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you are all invited!,8,22
monica,Are we going to take a limo?,8,22
joey,Sure! Why not?!,8,22
monica,Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!,8,22
rachel,"Well obviously I won't be able to come, for those of you who haven't checked their calendars today is my due date. Well you know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you've been during this time. I really couldn't have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really going to miss being pregnant.",8,22
rachel,"that is right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!",8,22
ross,"Uh sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?",8,22
rachel,You. Like you haven't done enough.,8,22
ross,"Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse.  Because with seahorses it's the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea.",8,22
rachel,God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!,8,22
phoebe,"Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end-",8,22
rachel,"Oh Phoebe, that is a great story. Can you tell it to me when you are getting me some iced tea?   Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!",8,22
chandler,Let's.,8,22
chandler,Hey! Did you have the baby yet?,8,22
rachel,Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? Because I'll do it.,8,22
monica,What are you doing here so early?,8,22
rachel,"They sent me home from work. They were like, ""Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby."" Well you know what? Screw them! If they don't want me there, I'll just hang out with you guys.",8,22
phoebe,Or you can do volunteer work.,8,22
joey,Hello?,8,22
estelle,"Joey! It's Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.",8,22
joey,One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!,8,22
estelle,"Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.",8,22
joey,Oh my God. So that is it?! I only get to bring one guest?,8,22
estelle,"Yeah, what time do you want to pick me up?  Hello?",8,22
joey,Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.,8,22
rachel,What-what about me?,8,22
joey,You said you didn't want to go.,8,22
rachel,I don't. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I'm pregnant you think I'm invisible.,8,22
joey,Definitely not invisible.,8,22
monica,"Well, well Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out. You snooze you lose.",8,22
chandler,"He's not snoozing, he's teaching a class.",8,22
monica,"Well then somebody's snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.",8,22
chandler,I haven't seen this dress.,8,22
monica,Star in a movie.,8,22
phoebe,"Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you?  Phoebe, Phoebe.",8,22
joey,Well uh-I think I want to take Chandler.,8,22
phoebe,Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Burrrrr!,8,22
chandler,You really want to take me?,8,22
joey,"Yeah! Yeah! I mean I'm sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but you know Chandler always supported my career. He's paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.",8,22
chandler,So you are never actually going to pay me back?,8,22
monica,"Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you are going to take him? Joey, I don't think you are comprehending just how slutty this dress is!",8,22
joey,"It's not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it's-it's everything. You know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn't believe in myself.",8,22
chandler,I always knew you were going to make it. I'm so proud of you.,8,22
joey,Thanks. That means a lot to me.,8,22
phoebe,"Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.",8,22
joey,I'm going to go shave.,8,22
chandler,"Yeah well, I'm going to go spit.",8,22
rachel,"Oh, I have to pee. If I don't come out in five minutes it's because I've choked to death on the potpourri stink.",8,22
phoebe,"When she comes out, you hold her nose, I'll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just  right out of her.",8,22
monica,"She's over a week late! She got to have it today, right?",8,22
phoebe,I don't know. I-I think it's still going to be a while.,8,22
monica,"Hmm, care to make it interesting? I'll bet you that she'll have it by this time tomorrow.",8,22
phoebe,you are on!,8,22
monica,"Okay, how much?",8,22
phoebe,One hundred thousand dollars!,8,22
monica,How about fifty bucks?,8,22
phoebe,Fine! I'll call Zurich and move some money around.,8,22
rachel,"All right, who's turn is it to help me get up!",8,22
phoebe,No one's here!  Oh damnit!,8,22
chandler,This is so exciting! It's so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?,8,22
joey,A little tall.,8,22
chandler,What?,8,22
joey,"Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller?  There you go.",8,22
chandler,It's just so glamorous.,8,22
phoebe,"Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! OH, you are still pregnant. Oh, I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. You know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.",8,22
rachel,"Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.",8,22
monica,Damnit! Damnit!! Here's your fifty bucks!,8,22
phoebe,"It's interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?",8,22
monica,Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!,8,22
phoebe,Fine! you are on!,8,22
monica,Okay.,8,22
phoebe,"Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp  right there.",8,22
ross,Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor's appointment.,8,22
monica,She's in the bathroom.,8,22
ross,"Rach, we got to go.",8,22
rachel,In a minute!!!,8,22
ross,"People ask me why we're not together, I just don't know what to tell them.",8,22
rachel,"All right, all right. Let's go!",8,22
ross,"Uh, do you want to go change first? The doctor's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry-",8,22
rachel,"No, I'm fine.",8,22
ross,Really? You don't think that is a little inappropriate.,8,22
phoebe,Good God man don't anger it.,8,22
rachel,"Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.",8,22
ross,Fine! Fine! You know what? Whatever you want. Okay? you are the mommy.,8,22
rachel,Oh uh-uh pal! Don't call me mommy! It's bad enough you call your own mother that.,8,22
monica,I'm actually with her on this one.,8,22
joey,"""I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along.""",8,22
joey,"Okay, this is it. It's my big fight scene coming up.",8,22
rachel,Ross.,8,22
ross,Yeah?,8,22
rachel,Can I ask you something?,8,22
ross,Uh-huh.,8,22
rachel,When Carol was pregnant with Ben-,8,22
ross,Mmm?,8,22
rachel,#NAME?,8,22
ross,Wow!,8,22
rachel,Excuse me?!,8,22
ross,"Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you've been a little short with me lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.",8,22
rachel,Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.,8,22
ross,"You know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then.",8,22
rachel,"Okay.  Seriously, breathe louder Ross! that is great!",8,22
ross,You know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that is half human and half pure evil!,8,22
rachel,"Hi Dr. Long, how are you?",8,22
ross,"Oh, you are nice to her.",8,22
rachel,She has the drugs!,8,22
dr. long,We'll do a quick check.,8,22
rachel,Okay.,8,22
dr. long,"So, eight days late huh?",8,22
rachel,Yeah.,8,22
dr. long,You must be a little uncomfortable.,8,22
rachel,"Eh, just a tad.",8,22
dr. long,"you are about 80 percent effaced, so you are on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you are anxious there are a few ways to help things along.",8,22
ross,Do them!!,8,22
dr. long,"Actually, they're things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I've found that some of them are quite effective.",8,22
rachel,"Well, we are ready to try anything.",8,22
dr. long,"Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink.",8,22
rachel,Okay.,8,22
dr. long,"You can take some caster oil, there's eating spicy foods-",8,22
rachel,Great! We will do all of those.,8,22
dr. long,"-taking a long walk, and then there's the one that is proved most effective",8,22
ross,You've got to be kidding me!,8,22
chandler,Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!,8,22
joey,You liked it? You really liked it?,8,22
chandler,"Oh-ho-ho, yeah!",8,22
joey,Which part exactly?,8,22
chandler,The whole thing! Can we go?,8,22
joey,"Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.",8,22
chandler,"I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!",8,22
joey,"Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?",8,22
chandler,I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.,8,22
joey,You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn't take any of my suggestions! that is for coming buddy. I'll see you later.,8,22
chandler,"Don't go! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!  Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!  Or, call an ambulance.",8,22
monica,Hey!,8,22
ross,Hey.,8,22
rachel,Hi!,8,22
monica,What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?,8,22
rachel,No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labour.,8,22
ross,"Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.",8,22
rachel,"Well, there is one thing that we haven't tried, but someone thinks that,  ""That will open up a can of worms.""",8,22
monica,"Well what is it? What is it? If it's going to help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.",8,22
ross,It's sex.,8,22
monica,Do it!,8,22
ross,Monica!,8,22
monica,"I'm just saying it's been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!",8,22
phoebe,"Oh I-I don't know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.",8,22
monica,"All right, let's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good!",8,22
ross,"Monica, what is the matter with you?",8,22
monica,Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.,8,22
rachel,Why? Why today?,8,22
monica,Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you are going to have the baby and I don't want to lose again!,8,22
ross,"What?! While she's been going through this hell, you've been making money?! you are betting on your friend staying in this misery?!",8,22
rachel,I'll take that bet.,8,22
ross,What?!,8,22
rachel,"Well, I'm miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!",8,22
ross,Can I get some of that action?,8,22
monica,Wait a minute! Now I'm betting against all three of you?,8,22
rachel,"Oh honey, don't worry. I really do feel like tomorrow's the day.",8,22
monica,"Oh, okay!",8,22
joey,Hey! Sleeping beauty!,8,22
chandler,Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!,8,22
joey,"Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?",8,22
chandler,I'm so sorry.,8,22
joey,"Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You've done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?",8,22
chandler,What?!,8,22
joey,"Give me a number, I don't want to owe you anything!",8,22
chandler,"You don't owe me anything, I don't want you money-",8,22
joey,"Ah-ah-ah! We're doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?",8,22
chandler,"I don't know, five hundred dollars?",8,22
joey,"Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?",8,22
chandler,"Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.",8,22
joey,"Okay, so that is another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that is-",8,22
chandler,Do you want a calculator?,8,22
joey,Please!,8,22
chandler,Here!,8,22
joey,"All right, what else?",8,22
chandler,"Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes-",8,22
joey,Which we're still keeping under our hats!,8,22
chandler,Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.,8,22
joey,"What the hell are you talking about,  ""The south will rise again man.""",8,22
chandler,"Yes, money well spent!",8,22
joey,"Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!",8,22
chandler,"Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food-",8,22
joey,"Okay. Okay, so I'm writing you a check for-So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?",8,22
ross,"Come on, finish your enchilada.",8,22
rachel,Ross I-We tried all the spicy food. It's not working.,8,22
ross,"Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha- Oh God! So-so hot!  Oh my- By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.",8,22
rachel,"I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.",8,22
ross,Stop it.,8,22
rachel,"Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what's going to work! It's doctor recommended!",8,22
ross,"I'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I'm dying.",8,22
rachel,"Oh come on Ross, we've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.",8,22
ross,"This is insane, I'm not going to make love to you just so that you'll go into labour.",8,22
rachel,Make love? What are you a girl?,8,22
ross,Always a great way to get in a man's pants.,8,22
rachel,"But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, you know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.",8,22
ross,I love when you talk dirty to me.,8,22
rachel,"Oh, I know it. you are right. that is not sexy. Oh-Oh!  Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it.  Oh God!",8,22
ross,"Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.",8,22
rachel,"Come on Ross! I'm miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.",8,22
ross,You know what?,8,22
rachel,What?!,8,22
ross,Forget it.,8,22
rachel,"Oh wow! What now Ross you are not going to talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know.  I mean you'd think the damn jalapeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!! that is not enough-  What are you doing?!",8,22
ross,I'm getting that baby out of you!,8,22
rachel,Oh God!,8,22

ross,Not so much.,8,22
rachel,Okay.,8,22
monica,Two hundred.,8,22

monica,"that is it. I'm done. I don't care when the baby comes, no more betting.",8,22
phoebe,Okay.,8,22
monica,Hello?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  I guess we can bet one more time.,8,22
phoebe,Is Rachel having the baby?,8,22
monica,How did you know that?!  Joey! Chandler!! It's time!,8,22
phoebe,They're at the coffeehouse.,8,22
monica,"You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds.  I bet you it has hair.  I bet you it's a girl.",8,22
phoebe,We know it's a girl!,8,22
monica,I'll give you really good odds.,8,22
ross,All right!  Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!,8,23
rachel,"Yes, the hard part is truly over.",8,23

phoebe,Oh you made it!,8,23

rachel,"They're not!! Ross, they're just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!",8,23
ross,"Well then we'd be in a lot of trouble, you don't know where any countries are.  Okay.  Uh, say would you umm- Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?",8,23
nurse,This is a hospital.,8,23

joey,God. He's crazy! Why doesn't he want to be with Rachel?,8,23
phoebe,I know!,8,23

chandler,I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.,8,23

phoebe,Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.,8,23
man,Oh yeah? How'd yours happen?,8,23

phoebe,Oh.,8,23
man,"Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn't paying attention?",8,23

rachel,Yeah it was.,8,23
woman,"Mine haven't been so bad. Oh! Here comes one now.  Oh, that was a big one!",8,23

monica,"Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.",8,23
monica,Okay. Let's hurry-Oh wait! Do we have a condom?  Oh right!,8,23

phoebe,"Ooh, this is it!  Oh, that is him! that is him!",8,23
joey,Great! Go get him.,8,23
phoebe,"Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.",8,23
joey,He's not really my type.,8,23
phoebe,"No not you, Dr. Drake Ramoray. You can ask him questions and see what's he like. People tell doctors everything.",8,23
joey,But you said he was this great guy!,8,23
phoebe,"But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.",8,23
joey,You do attract some stinkers.,8,23
rachel,"Dr. Long, I've been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you got to give me some good news! How many centimetres am I dilated? Eight? Nine?",8,23

cliff,Yeah.,8,23
joey,Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?,8,23

joey,"Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff you know, sexually?",8,23
cliff,No!,8,23
joey,"Ooh, wrong answer.",8,23
nurse,This room's available.,8,23
rachel,"Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that is four, one higher than the number of centimetres that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I'm next! It's my turn! It's only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I'm going to sue you! Not this hospital, I'm going to sue you! And my husband  he's a lawyer!",8,23
ross,Uh Rach-,8,23
rachel,Go get back on that case honey!,8,23

ross,Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears!,8,23
man,Hi sweetie!,8,23
janice,"Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office. Thank God for adult acne huh?",8,23
sid,I still can't believe it! I'm the luckiest guy in the world!,8,23
ross,Really?,8,23
sid,What'd he say?,8,23
janice,"OH you know what? You have to speak very loudly when you are talking to Sid, because he's almost completely deaf.",8,23
rachel,Oh!,8,23
ross,Oh there you go!,8,23
rachel,I get it!,8,23
janice,"So? Congratulations you two, I didn't even know you got married.",8,23
rachel,Oh we-we didn't.,8,23
ross,No-no. We-,8,23

ross,"Uh well umm-we're just not in that place, you know? But we're very excited about this.",8,23
janice,Oh. Well then shut me up.,8,23
rachel,Just tell me how.,8,23
janice,"Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.",8,23
ross,Sid you lucky deaf bastard.,8,23
phoebe,What else? What else?,8,23
joey,"Uh, well he's 33.",8,23
phoebe,Oh. Ah-uh.,8,23
joey,A widower.,8,23
phoebe,Oh.,8,23
joey,"He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he's not into anything weird sexually.",8,23
phoebe,Enter Pheebs.,8,23
chandler,Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?,8,23
monica,"We could, or we can have sex in it.",8,23
chandler,"Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!",8,23
monica,Okay mister! Fertilize me!,8,23
monica,Does that sound like Janice?,8,23
chandler,"If it's not, then there's two of them. And that would mean it's the end of the world!",8,23
monica,Hey!,8,23
ross,Hey!,8,23
chandler,Hi.,8,23
rachel,Oh hi.,8,23
monica,I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?,8,23
rachel,Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you are trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?,8,23
chandler,Weirdest thing. Did I hear--Mother of God it's true!,8,23
janice,Chandler Bing!,8,23
chandler,Jan-Janice!,8,23
ross,"Not just Janice, Janice in labour, contracting and everything.",8,23
janice,"Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.",8,23
chandler,Janice I didn't even know you were pregnant! Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?,8,23
janice,It's you. This is yours.,8,23
chandler,What?!,8,23
janice,Look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years!,8,23
chandler,that is funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labour hurt?,8,23
phoebe,"Okay I've got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?",8,23
cliff,"I'd have to say-the talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that you are making me eat him.",8,23
phoebe,Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? I'm sorry.,8,23
cliff,"No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.",8,23
phoebe,"Oh, I'll get it.",8,23
cliff,Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.,8,23
phoebe,"Relax, it's not like we're forking.",8,23
rachel,Oh that is five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn't she want to come out?,8,23
ross,You know what I think it is? I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.,8,23
rachel,Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!,8,23
dr. long,"Twenty-one hours, you are a hero.",8,23
rachel,Doctor you got to do something! I think you got to give me drugs or you got to light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.,8,23
dr. long,"Actually, I think you are ready to go to the delivery room.",8,23
rachel,What?,8,23
dr. long,"Ten centimetres, you are about to become a mom.",8,23
rachel,My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat you! Sucker!,8,23
cliff,Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?,8,23
phoebe,You know what? This one is.,8,23
cliff,Oh my God! that is the doctor who was in my room before!,8,23
phoebe,"Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.",8,23
cliff,"I'm telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!",8,23
phoebe,"Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?",8,23
joey,"Rachel's having her baby!!  Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist.",8,23
cliff,That-that is him! You know him?,8,23
phoebe,"Okay. Okay. I-Okay umm-this-I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm you know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I'm coming off right now.",8,23
cliff,I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?,8,23
joey,Fake? Excuse me? Hello?,8,23
cliff,And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.,8,23
phoebe,"you are right, that was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?",8,23
cliff,I don't think so.,8,23
joey,"Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!",8,23
phoebe,"Uh Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.",8,23
joey,Right!,8,23
phoebe,"Umm, look we don't, we don't really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot.",8,23
cliff,It doesn't happen to me either.,8,23
joey,Me neither.,8,23
dr. long,Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5-4-,8,23
rachel,3-2-1 oh!!,8,23
dr. long,"Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.",8,23
rachel,"I can't. I can't push anymore, I can't.",8,23
ross,Sweetie you are doing great.,8,23
rachel,Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!,8,23
dr. long,"Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.",8,23
ross,What? You do? You do?  Oh my God!,8,23
rachel,"Don't say, ""Oh my God!"" Oh my God what?",8,23
ross,What is that?,8,23
dr. long,"It's the baby's buttock, she's breech.",8,23
ross,"Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.",8,23
rachel,Oh God. Is she going to be okay?,8,23
dr. long,"She's going to be fine. Okay, she's in a more difficult position so you are going to have to push even harder now. Go! Push!",8,23
ross,Go!,8,23
dr. long,"Rachel you are going to have to push even harder, nothing's happening!",8,23
rachel,"I'm sorry, I can't!",8,23
ross,Yes you can!,8,23
rachel,I can't!,8,23
ross,Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let's go!,8,23
rachel,"I can't. Please, you do it for me.",8,23
ross,No! Come on let's-One more time! One final push! Ready? 1-2-3!,8,23
dr. long,Good!,8,23

rachel,Are you okay?,8,23
ross,You have no idea how much this hurts.  Keep going! Keep going!,8,23
dr. long,Here we go!,8,23
ross,Oh! Oh! She's upside down but she's coming! She's coming!,8,23
rachel,Oh God!,8,23
ross,Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she's here.,8,23
ross,Oh she's-she's perfect.,8,23
rachel,"Oh, she's so tiny.  Where'd she go?",8,23
ross,Oh it's okay. They're just-they're just wrapping her up.,8,23
rachel,"Okay. Well be careful with her, she's really tiny.",8,23
dr. long,Here she is!,8,23
rachel,"Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me.  I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she's looking at me. Hi! I know you.",8,23
dr. long,Do we have a name yet?,8,23
rachel,"No, not yet.",8,23

rachel,"Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.",8,23
rachel,Hello baby girl.,8,23

joey,She looks so real! you know what I mean! She's this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and-uh-oh.,8,23
rachel,What?,8,23
joey,"Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we're good.",8,23
phoebe,"Okay, my turn. My turn.  Oh! you are so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head!  I won't.",8,23
monica,What's the matter?,8,23
rachel,"Oh nothing I- Sorry, I just can't stop crying.",8,23
ross,"The doctor says it's completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you are sleep deprived.",8,23
rachel,So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God.,8,23
joey,What's the matter now?,8,23
rachel,I was reliving it.,8,23
phoebe,oh.,8,23
chandler,"So, do you know what you are going to call her yet?",8,23
phoebe,"Oh, wait a minute it's not going to be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!",8,23
ross,"Uh actually, we-we've narrowed it down to two names.",8,23
rachel,"Yeah, and you know what? I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it.",8,23
ross,"Wow! Umm, okay uh-everyone-this-is Isabella.  What?",8,23
rachel,"that is not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.",8,23
chandler,So then I guess Ferdinad is out.,8,23
joey,What was the other one Ross?,8,23
ross,"Umm, Delilah.",8,23
rachel,Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.,8,23
ross,"So I guess we're back to uh, Baby Girl.",8,23
phoebe,Yay!,8,23
rachel,Well what are we going to do?,8,23
monica,"It's okay honey, you'll find a name.",8,23
ross,"Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.",8,23
chandler,You do?,8,23
monica,"Yeah, I've had them picked out since I was fourteen.",8,23
chandler,"Oh no, it's going to be named after some snack or baked good isn't it?",8,23
rachel,Well tell us! What are they?,8,23
monica,"Umm, okay. If it's a boy it's Daniel.",8,23
rachel,And if it's a girl?,8,23
monica,I don't want to say.,8,23
rachel,"Oh, just tell us! We're not going to want it!",8,23
monica,Okay. It's Emma.,8,23
rachel,Emma!  See? I don't want it.,8,23
monica,Take it.,8,23
rachel,What?,8,23
monica,It's clearly an Emma.,8,23
rachel,"Oh honey, but you love that name.",8,23
monica,"Yeah, but I love you more. Besides you know, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed. I mean-  Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that is you. you are our little Em. Oh what's that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin?  You want a cousin right now?!",8,23
chandler,That was amazing.,8,23
monica,"I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.",8,23
chandler,"And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.",8,23
janice,Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.,8,23
rachel,oh!  Wow! He kind of takes your breath away doesn't he?,8,23
janice,He's a keeper. How are you feeling?,8,23
rachel,"Oh, I'm fine.",8,23
janice,"Can I just say, I really admire what you are doing. Just raising her all alone.",8,23
rachel,"Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.",8,23
janice,"Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?",8,23
rachel,"Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!",8,23
janice,"I'm telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they're going to be there until they start their real family.",8,23
rachel,Well I-that is never going to happen with Ross.,8,23
janice,"Oh well that is what I thought about my first husband, now I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.",8,23
rachel,Really?,8,23
janice,"I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two  are on your own.",8,23
rachel,"Well- that is-You know-that is-We've been alone for the last twenty minutes we're doing okay. Besides you know what? I-I-Maybe we won't be alone, Because lately I-I-things have been happening between me and Ross, you know? Right before I went into labour, we-we had this kiss. You know? So it might be the-the beginning of something.",8,23
ross,Hey Janice!,8,23
janice,Oh hi!,8,23
ross,Who's this little guy?,8,23
janice,"Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.",8,23
ross,No-no. No.,8,23
janice,I'm going to leave the three of you alone.,8,23
ross,Okay.,8,23
janice,Bye.,8,23
ross,Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?,8,23
rachel,"Uh-huh. you know what I was, I was thinking about?",8,23
ross,Huh?,8,23
rachel,Umm-that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?,8,23
ross,"Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we-we got to be careful. We-we can't let that happen again, you know?",8,23
rachel,Right.,8,23
ross,I mean we don't want to go down that road do we?,8,23
rachel,"No! No, of course not. No. that is why I brought it up.  They didn't have any sodas?",8,23
ross,"Oh my God! I'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.",8,23
rachel,that is all right.  And so it begins.,8,23
phoebe,Is she in there?,8,23
ross,"Yeah. She's putting her down now, that is her.",8,23
phoebe,Oh!,8,23
ross,Look at Emma!,8,23
phoebe,"I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?",8,23
ross,"Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.",8,23
phoebe,"I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again?  No, I know. I know, because you are not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.",8,23
ross,It's-it's complicated okay?,8,23
phoebe,"Yeah that is true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.",8,23
ross,"Look, we've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.  It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out-I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything- Oh that is-now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.",8,23
phoebe,"I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.",8,23
ross,"Yeah, exactly.",8,23
phoebe,Right.  Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.,8,23
joey,Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.  What's the matter?,8,23
rachel,Nothing.,8,23
joey,What is it? Hey!,8,23
rachel,Really it's nothing. I'm just-,8,23
joey,"Rach come on, what?",8,23
rachel,I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are going to be all alone.,8,23
joey,What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?,8,23
rachel,"Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.",8,23
joey,"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",8,23
rachel,"I'm just saying that you know, someday Ross is going to meet somebody and-he's going to have his own life. Right?",8,23
joey,"Yeah, I guess so.",8,23
rachel,I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,8,23
joey,"Hey, listen to me, listen to me-you are never ever going to be alone. Okay? I promise that is not going to happen.",8,23
rachel,Joey. Honey what would I do without you?,8,23
joey,You don't have to worry about that okay?,8,23
rachel,"Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They're right on that chair under Ross's coat.",8,23
joey,Sure.,8,23
rachel,Okay.,8,23
joey,My God.,8,23
rachel,Joey.,8,23
rachel,Oh my God.  Okay.,8,23
rachel,Joey.,9,1
rachel,Oh my God.  Okay.,9,1
rachel,So uh…I guess we should…make it official huh?,9,1
joey,Uh… Look Rach… Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It’s my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.,9,1
ross,Hey Joey.  Hey you.,9,1
rachel,Hey you.,9,1
joey,"Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I’m really more of a candy guy.",9,1
ross,"You’re weird today.   Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.",9,1
rachel,"Uh yeah, actually I kind of need to talk to you too.",9,1
ross,"Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?",9,1
joey,No.,9,1
ross,What?,9,1
joey,"Oh, I’m sorry. I meant no.",9,1
monica,Hi! Hey look who’s here!,9,1
mr. geller,Where’s my granddaughter? I’ve been practicing my magic tricks.,9,1
chandler,He pulled a quarter out of my ear!,9,1
ross,"Hey, where’s uh, where’s mom?",9,1
mr. geller,She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.,9,1
monica,"Oh, Aunt Liddy’s coming? That means we get five dollars each!",9,1
mr. geller,So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this?,9,1
chandler,Okay. Wow.,9,1
ross,"Uh Dad, Emma’s in the nursery. I’ll take you now. If you want, but  I really want to talk to you.",9,1
rachel,"I know, I still need to talk to you.",9,1
joey,"Oh hey but, before you guys do that  I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.",9,1
phoebe,Oh and I need to talk to you.,9,1
monica,About what?,9,1
phoebe,To see if know what these guys are talking about.,9,1
monica,Isn’t she beautiful?,9,1
mr. geller,"Look at her, my first grandchild.",9,1
ross,What about Ben?,9,1
mr. geller,"Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter.  Wow.",9,1
phoebe,"Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?",9,1
ross,"Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.",9,1
phoebe,"Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow, you could’ve done that with us there.",9,1
ross,Yeah right.,9,1
phoebe,"Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’t talk to Rachel.",9,1
ross,What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?,9,1
phoebe,"Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.",9,1
joey,"Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?",9,1
chandler,Sure.,9,1
joey,Dude I just did something terrible.,9,1
chandler,That was you?! I thought it was Jack!,9,1
joey,"No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!",9,1
chandler,What?! Why does she think that?,9,1
joey,Because it kind of looked like I did.,9,1
chandler,"Again, what?!",9,1
joey,"Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand",9,1
chandler,As we all are at some point during the day.,9,1
joey,It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!,9,1
chandler,Ross had a ring?! And he was going to propose?,9,1
joey,I guess.,9,1
chandler,And you did it first?! This is going to kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!,9,1
joey,I know! I know it’s awful.,9,1
chandler,"Well, what did she say?",9,1
joey,She said yes.,9,1
chandler,Does Ross know?,9,1
joey,"Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?",9,1
chandler,Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.,9,1
joey,"Oh, I like that. Yeah",9,1
chandler,"If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!",9,1
joey,Now let’s not get carried away.,9,1
monica,I want a baby.,9,1
chandler,"Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.",9,1
monica,"Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?",9,1
chandler,"I’m so tired.  Yeah okay, but no foreplay.",9,1
monica,Deal!,9,1
ross,Dad seriously! you know you really should see someone about that!,9,1
mr. geller,Noted.,9,1
ross,"I want to go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you going to be okay alone for a bit?",9,1
mr. geller,"Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.",9,1
ross,Actually umm,9,1
phoebe,Hey!,9,1
rachel,Hi.,9,1
phoebe,Are you all right?,9,1
rachel,Uhh… I think I just got engaged.,9,1
phoebe,Oh my God! He did it?,9,1
rachel,Well…did you know he was going to ask me?,9,1
phoebe,Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.,9,1
rachel,And you really think this is a good idea?,9,1
phoebe,"I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.",9,1
rachel,I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.,9,1
phoebe,"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.",9,1
rachel,Really?! Even Ross?,9,1
phoebe,Especially Ross!,9,1
joey,"Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh you know what? I’ll-I’ll come back later.",9,1
ross,"Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll come back.",9,1
phoebe,"There he goes, your fiance.",9,1
rachel,I guess so.,9,1
phoebe,Although he does play with himself in his sleep.,9,1
rachel,I can’t say that I’m surprised.,9,1
ross,"Dad, what are you doing?",9,1
mr. geller,I think there are people in there having sex.,9,1
joey,"It can’t be me, I’m standing right here.",9,1
mr. geller,want to peek?,9,1
ross,No!,9,1
mr. geller,Come on!,9,1
ross,you know what? I don’t like you without mom.  Come on.,9,1
joey,We’re not peeking?,9,1
mr. geller,Well I’m peeking.  Oh my God!,9,1
chandler,"Hello sir, you know Monica.",9,1
joey,"Hey uh, is it okay to come in?",9,1
rachel,"Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!",9,1
joey,"Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I got to tell you.",9,1
rachel,Hey!,9,1
nurse,Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?,9,1
rachel,"Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my breast?",9,1
nurse,"It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but don’t worry. It’ll happen.",9,1
joey,Yowsa!,9,1
rachel,"Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.",9,1
joey,Dear Lord.,9,1
rachel,"I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?",9,1
joey,"Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that",9,1
rachel,"Oh look, she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?  She looks scared. Doesn’t she look scared?",9,1
joey,"you know, I don’t really know her.",9,1
nurse,Why don’t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.,9,1
joey,Are you kidding me?!,9,1
rachel,It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!,9,1
joey,I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy!,9,1
phoebe,Oh hey! Wait up!,9,1
ross,Hi!,9,1
phoebe,Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey because I didn’t know if he knew yet.,9,1
ross,"What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.",9,1
phoebe,"No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!",9,1
ross,What?,9,1
phoebe,"Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.",9,1
ross,"Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.",9,1
phoebe,Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?,9,1
ross,I am a doctor! you know what? I’m just going to go and talk to Rachel myself.,9,1
phoebe,"All right, me too.  Should we wake her up?",9,1
ross,"No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.",9,1
phoebe,And so engaged.,9,1
ross,What?  Oh my God! She-she thinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!,9,1
phoebe,Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? you know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.,9,1
ross,I didn’t give her that ring!,9,1
phoebe,Really?,9,1
ross,No!,9,1
phoebe,So whose ring is it?,9,1
ross,It’s mine.,9,1
phoebe,Is it an engagement ring?,9,1
ross,Yes!,9,1
phoebe,But you didn’t give it to her?,9,1
ross,No!,9,1
phoebe,But you were going to propose?,9,1
ross,No!!,9,1
phoebe,"Huh, I might be losing interest in this.",9,1
ross,"Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kind of…wanted ah…start…things up again.",9,1
phoebe,"Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.",9,1
ross,"Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?",9,1
phoebe,"No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.",9,1
ross,Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose!  Unless uh…  Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do.,9,1
chandler,"Look, we can’t stay in here forever.",9,1
monica,"Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!",9,1
chandler,"This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.",9,1
monica,Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?,9,1
mr. geller,Of course. I’ll always be your dad.,9,1
chandler,"I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun.",9,1
monica,It wasn’t fun?!,9,1
chandler,"Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why…  Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.",9,1
mr. geller,"Oh, I don’t think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.",9,1
monica,"The truth is, Dad, we’re-we’re trying.",9,1
mr. geller,What?,9,1
monica,"Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant.",9,1
mr. geller,"Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there!  I’ll guard the door!",9,1
monica,"Well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later.",9,1
mr. geller,Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t think so! Aren’t you ovulating?,9,1
monica,Daddy?!,9,1
mr. geller,"Well you got to get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That’s how I got my bad hip.",9,1
chandler,"That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.",9,1
mr. geller,"This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was",9,1
monica,Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.,9,1
mr. geller,"You’re right, you’re right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.",9,1
monica,I don’t feel good right now.,9,1
mr. geller,"But pleasure is important,  and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?",9,1
chandler,"Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.",9,1
monica,Hey.,9,1
rachel,Hey. I need to tell you something.,9,1
monica,"Well, now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cut off.",9,1
rachel,Joey asked me marry him.,9,1
monica,What?,9,1
rachel,Joey proposed to me.,9,1
monica,Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!,9,1
rachel,"Well, I-I said yes.",9,1
monica,"What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross’s baby! It’s-it’s so inappropriate. No, it’s worse than that. It’s wrong. It’s… It is bigger than mine!",9,1
rachel,"I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.",9,1
monica,You can’t marry him!,9,1
rachel,Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.,9,1
monica,Well do you love him?,9,1
rachel,Sure.,9,1
monica,Sure?,9,1
rachel,"Yeah, I mean whatever.",9,1
monica,"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",9,1
rachel,"No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?",9,1
chandler,You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?,9,1
joey,"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.",9,1
chandler,"Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!",9,1
joey,I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.,9,1
chandler,Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.,9,1
joey,"Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don’t want to hurt her.",9,1
chandler,"Okay, look, just do it gently.",9,1
joey,"You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I’ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.",9,1
ross,Hey.,9,1
rachel,Hey.,9,1
ross,"Listen, I um… I heard about the engagement.",9,1
rachel,Surprised?,9,1
ross,"And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um…I didn’t propose to you.",9,1
rachel,I know.,9,1
ross,I don’t think you do.,9,1
rachel,You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.,9,1
ross,"Poor baby, you’re so tired. Rach, I didn’t propose to you, Joey didn’t propose to you, and Chandler didn’t propose to you.",9,1
rachel,"Uh… You didn’t propose to me, Chandler didn’t propose to me, but Joey did.",9,1
ross,Joey proposed to you?,9,1
joey,I can come back.,9,1
ross,"Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?",9,1
joey,No.,9,1
rachel,Yes you did!,9,1
joey,"Actually, technically, I didn’t.",9,1
rachel,Well then why did you give me a ring?,9,1
ross,"Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?",9,1
joey,"No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!",9,1
rachel,"Yes, you did!",9,1
joey,"No, I didn’t!",9,1
rachel,"Yes, you did!",9,1
joey,"No, I didn’t!",9,1
rachel,"Yes, you did! And don’t you say, ""No, I didn’t!""",9,1
joey,Ah!,9,1
rachel,He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.,9,1
ross,Whoa! You were down on one knee?,9,1
joey,"Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn’t…I didn’t propose!",9,1
ross,Then what did happen?,9,1
rachel,"Yeah, what did happen?",9,1
joey,"Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.",9,1
rachel,"Yeah, but you said, ""Will you marry me?""",9,1
joey,"No, I didn’t!",9,1
rachel,"Yes, you did!",9,1
joey,"No, I didn’t!",9,1
rachel,"Yes, you did—Oh my God you didn’t!  Well then why didn’t you tell me that before?!",9,1
joey,"Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!",9,1
ross,"Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!",9,1
joey,I’ll tell you about it later. Be cool.,9,1
rachel,"Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!",9,1
joey,"It wasn’t my ring! It’s Ross’s ring! That’s why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.",9,1
ross,What?!,9,1
rachel,You were going to propose to me?,9,1
ross,Uhh… No.,9,1
joey,"Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}",9,1
ross,"But I-I was going to see if you know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that—I mean that-that was all, Rach.",9,1
joey,"Dude, step up! I proposed.",9,1
ross,"No, you didn’t!",9,1
joey,Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.,9,1
nurse,"Hey, she just woke up! She’s hungry. Why don’t we give this another try?",9,1

rachel,"Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What   are we going to do? We have to find a paediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that   when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?",9,3
ross,"Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that is a   good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.",9,3
rachel,Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!,9,3
ross,"Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another   doctor, but I got to get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.",9,3
rachel,"What? What, do you mean you are not feeling well?   What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had   that shot.",9,3
ross,"You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!",9,3
rachel,"Wiener, Wiener  Wiener, Wiener!!!",9,3
ross,Rachel!!!,9,3
rachel,Great! Now he's going to know it was me!,9,3
phoebe,Hey!,9,3
joey,Hey!,9,3
phoebe,So how is this for our big double date tonight?,9,3
joey,Oh my God!,9,3
phoebe,"Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.",9,3
joey,"Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?",9,3
phoebe,"Of course not! And you are going to love Mary Ellen.   She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this,   but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.",9,3
joey,No.,9,3
phoebe,"Come on, give me something. What's his name?",9,3
joey,Mike.,9,3
phoebe,Mike? Okay! What's his last name?,9,3
joey,Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?,9,3
phoebe,"All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant   in a couple hours.",9,3
joey and phoebe,,9,3
joey,Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why   couldn't I have said...  There's no guy in   there!,9,3
rachel,"It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how   do you know the good ones from the ones who are going to push their penis against   your knee?",9,3
monica,Excuse me?,9,3
chandler,I know what she's talking about.,9,3
rachel,"We've got to find a new paediatrician. Ross was getting   sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.",9,3
monica,Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?,9,3
rachel,Ross said he died.,9,3
monica,"He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said   he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.",9,3
rachel,"Oh, great! Well, then I'm going to take Emma to see   him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.",9,3
monica,"Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood   therapist.",9,3
chandler,He saw a therapist?,9,3
monica,"Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just   really freaked him out.",9,3
rachel,Why? What was it?,9,3
monica,That I was going to eat him.,9,3
joey,MIKE!!!,9,3
mike,Yeah?,9,3
joey,Okay!,9,3
mike,"I got to tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with   you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I   should be open and taking some risks.",9,3
joey,"Everything is going to be fine. Just follow my lead, okay?   All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.",9,3
mike,I am Mike.,9,3
joey,Atta boy!,9,3
joey,"Okay, look...",9,3
everyone,,9,3
phoebe,"Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do   you and Joey know each other anyway?",9,3
mike,"How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a   nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.",9,3
joey,From school.,9,3
mike,"Yeah, we met in college.  I mean,   high school.",9,3
phoebe,"Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up   to these days?",9,3
mike,"Well, I'm a lawyer.",9,3
joey,"Mike, 'attorney at law'!",9,3
mike,"Actually, I just gave up my practice.",9,3
joey,What? that is the kind of thing you usually run by me.,9,3
mike,"I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I   figured if I don't do this now, I never will.",9,3
phoebe,"Wow, that is great! I liked that better than the law   thing, so...",9,3
joey,Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to   Mike.,9,3
mary ellen,I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.,9,3
joey,"No, no, that is not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.",9,3
monica,Hey!,9,3
chandler,Hey!,9,3
monica,What are you doing?,9,3
chandler,Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.,9,3
monica,that is so sweet. Find anything?,9,3
chandler,Slim Pickings.,9,3
monica,"Nothing, huh?",9,3
chandler,"No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant.   They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're   looking for someone to shovel mesquite.",9,3
monica,'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.,9,3
chandler,'So Cheesy' also has an opening.,9,3
monica,"Honey, that is okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy,   who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.",9,3
chandler,Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming   with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'.   'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.,9,3
monica,"Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm   good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been   relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo    is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this   is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo    'I'll take it!'",9,3
rachel,"Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment   for Emma.",9,3
receptionist,"Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient,   he should be out shortly.",9,3
dr. gettleman,"I think you just have a cold,   it's definitely not Strep.",9,3
ross,Thanks doctor.,9,3
dr. gettleman,Would you like a lollypop?,9,3
ross,You even have to ask?!    He is alive!,9,3
phoebe,"You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have   known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.",9,3
joey,"Yeah, that is because we had a bit of a falling out.   Mike hit my mom with a car.",9,3
mike,"No, I didn't.",9,3
joey,"that is okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're   friends again everything's great!",9,3
joey,"Please, we're trying to have a conversation.",9,3
mary ellen,"Wow, you are a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.",9,3
mike,Days of Our Lives'! that is why you look so familiar!,9,3
phoebe,What?!,9,3
mike,What?!,9,3
joey,What?!,9,3
phoebe,Do you not know each other?,9,3
joey,"Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that   we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other.   We played all kinds of games.  Hey, remember the one where I punch   you in the face for not being cool?!",9,3
phoebe,"Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters   does Joey have?",9,3
mike,Six!,9,3
joey,What are you doing? I said seven!     Argh!!!,9,3
phoebe,"Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?",9,3
joey,"Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.",9,3
mike,"I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his   mother with a car.",9,3
phoebe,"You are unbelievable! I spent so much time   finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and   cute and loose.",9,3
mary ellen,Hey!,9,3
phoebe,Who are you kidding?  You just find some   guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!,9,3
joey,"Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like   this guy I can find you a better one.  Mike!! Mike!!",9,3
phoebe,I'm out of here,9,3
mike,It was nice meeting you!,9,3
joey,you are leaving too?,9,3
mary ellen,I'll stay if you can tell me my name.,9,3
joey,Good night!,9,3
chandler,"Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got   a lot of packing to do.",9,3
monica,you are right.  Maybe I shouldn't go.,9,3
chandler,What?,9,3
monica,"So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,   Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.",9,3
chandler,How far outside?,9,3
monica,Manhattan.,9,3
chandler,"And you are thinking of taking it?  So before   you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now   it's old job,  me,  new job.",9,3
monica,"I'm going to miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot   to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.",9,3
chandler,What happened to 'you can't live without me four   days a week'?,9,3
monica,"Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days   is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see   you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really   if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make   it one day, we've got real problems my friend.",9,3
chandler,I think you should take the job.,9,3
monica,Really?,9,3
chandler,Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you   start chattering like a monkey.,9,3
monica,that is the nicest anyone has ever said to me!,9,3
ross,Hey!,9,3
monica,How was the paediatrician?,9,3
rachel,"Oh, I really liked him.  Yeah, it   was really, really, really good.",9,3
ross,You promised you wouldn't say anything.,9,3
rachel,I know.  Ross still sees his paediatrician!!!    I don't care!,9,3
monica,Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?,9,3
ross,He's a brilliant diagnostician!,9,3
chandler,Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?,9,3
rachel,"Ross, seriously! You've got to go to an appropriate   doctor.",9,3
ross,"Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's   a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,   he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favourite patient!'",9,3
chandler,Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer   in your touchy?,9,3
ross,"Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security   blanket to college!",9,3
chandler,That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!,9,3
ross,It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!,9,3
mike,"Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can   we talk?",9,3
phoebe,Sure.,9,3
mike,"I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm   a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny   guy.",9,3
phoebe,Why did you go along with that?,9,3
mike,"Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't.   And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.",9,3
phoebe,"that is true.  Well, is anything you told me   about yourself true?",9,3
mike,"My name in Mike, and I do play piano.",9,3
phoebe,Prove it.,9,3
mike,There isn't a piano here.,9,3
phoebe,That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.,9,3
mike,,9,3
phoebe,You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.,9,3
mike,Really?,9,3
phoebe,Uh uh.,9,3
mike,that is great. What kind of music do you play?,9,3
phoebe,"Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right   now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.",9,3
mike,"Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...",9,3
phoebe,"It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.",9,3
mike,Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you   out?,9,3
joey,,9,3
phoebe,"Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah,   that would be nice.",9,3
joey,Look at this. My two best friends!,9,3

ross,I am a single parent.,9,3
sally,"It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social   life. I mean, where are you going to meet someone?",9,3
ross,"Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the   paediatrician's office.",9,3

ross,"Hmm, yeah.  Come   on Ross jr. It's time to go in.",9,3

rachel,Ubb.,9,5
ross,"A pigeon, a pigeon.  No, no  wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby,  seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle,  however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon.  Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays   are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the  apartment.",9,5
rachel,"Boy, are you going to be sorry if that is true.",9,5

ross,Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.,9,5
chandler,Uhh. You are welcome.,9,5

chandler,What?,9,5

rachel,"N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got  to do.",9,5
phoebe,And that is Judy over there at the bar with Emma?,9,5
rachel,"Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted,  worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with  you and, oh, she spit up!",9,5

waiter,I'll give you another minute.,9,5
joey,"Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!",9,5
ross,"Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. you are turning into an obsessive  mother. Okay, you need to stop.",9,5

rachel,Could you please get her attention?,9,5
ross,W-oa - Mommy!,9,5
phoebe,"Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick  up the sock! Pick up the sock!  I'm sorry, was that rude?  Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt  the hideousness  that is this  evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was  have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you  didn't even have the courtesy to call.  Well, it's too late  now.",9,5
ross,"Well, ??? think that is us?",9,5
phoebe,"well, this is, this is, this is not over!   Hello?",9,5
joey,"Well, what is going on with you  two?",9,5
monica,"Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.",9,5

rachel,"Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma  home?",9,5

joey,"Aaahhh, look    at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious?  Have you not talked about it yet?     Am I making you uncomfortable?  If you were bigger you'd hit me,    huh...? Ahh",9,6
phoebe,I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early    for us to be... having that conversation.,9,6
mike,Is it?,9,6
phoebe,"Maybe not, is it?",9,6
mike,"Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this    way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet    someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have    this...  No, not... that is gum.  Ooh, five bucks...    I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...",9,6
phoebe,"I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?",9,6
mike,"Oh, sorry.",9,6
phoebe,"Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the    five dollars.",9,6
mike,It's to my apartment.,9,6
phoebe,"Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for    Phoebe and Mike.",9,6
mike,"Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have    to give me your key just because...",9,6
phoebe,"Oh no, I want to.",9,6
mike,"Oh, thank God.",9,6
phoebe,"Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never    meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go.",9,6
mike,"Is this cool, huh?",9,6
phoebe,It really is.,9,6
joey,"Oh, I know it... It    is amazing these little things open doors... huh!",9,6
rachel,"So I don't go back to work for another four weeks,    but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance    to know her.",9,6
prospective nanny,"I think that is    really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better.",9,6
rachel,"that is great, great. So do you have any questions    for us?",9,6
prospective nanny,Not really.,9,6
rachel,All right. Well thank you so much for coming...,9,6
ross,Thank you.,9,6
rachel,Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.,9,6
prospective nanny,"Oh, you know, wait. I do have    one question.  Do you guys do random drug    testing?",9,6
ross,"Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.",9,6
prospective nanny,"that is cool. But... but if you do, I'm    going to need three days notice.",9,6
rachel,Okidoki!  Wow! We're never going to find a nanny.,9,6
ross,"Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews     And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider    the uhm... the first one we met with.",9,6
rachel,"What, the blonde with no bra?",9,6
ross,"She was blonde?  Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree    in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three    years.",9,6
rachel,Okay...,9,6
sandy,Hi... I'm Sandy.,9,6
ross,And she's a little mannish...,9,6
phoebe,Oh my God! David!,9,6
david,Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?,9,6
phoebe,"No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW,    hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?",9,6
david,"Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to    explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that    we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.",9,6
phoebe,"Who cares, it got you here.",9,6
david,"Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got    on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your    address I... I... I didn't even think about it.",9,6
phoebe,Wow. Where is your luggage?,9,6
david,Damn it!,9,6
phoebe,"A-All right, well... I'll call the cab company.",9,6
david,"Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you    just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression,    uhm... it goes",9,6
phoebe,"Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually,    no, I look pretty good.",9,6
david,"Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see    someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and    you start thinking about",9,6
phoebe,No...,9,6
phoebe,I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How    can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?,9,6
monica,Maybe he didn't give you a chance.,9,6
phoebe,He said,9,6
monica,"Oh, well... That had been your window.",9,6
phoebe,"Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking,    I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking",9,6
monica,Really? The scientist guy?,9,6
phoebe,Really? Chandler?,9,6
monica,Continue...,9,6
phoebe,"OH. Okay, then it gets worse, Because then I told him    that I would see him tomorrow night.",9,6
monica,Phoebe!,9,6
phoebe,"I know!  Evil! And... and... and...    I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!",9,6
monica,"Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the    same day that you and Mike exchange keys?",9,6
phoebe,"Uh uh... Yeah...!, you know. And given    my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.",9,6
monica,What are you going to do?,9,6
phoebe,"I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that    nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated    moral situation, no right, no wrong...",9,6
monica,You have to tell David!,9,6
phoebe,"Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation    with Joey.",9,6
chandler,"Funniest guy she's ever met!     I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you are a door... You just like knock-knock    jokes...  Save it for    inside!",9,6
monica,Hey!,9,6
chandler,Hey!,9,6
phoebe,Hey!,9,6
chandler,"So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they    call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.  And what's with Oklahoma    having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from    the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.",9,6
monica,Was your cabin    pressurised?,9,6
chandler,And don't get    me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.,9,6
phoebe,Okay.,9,6
chandler,"What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two    words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so,    I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried    chicken? Could be fricken. Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the freaking?  See, that is... that is funny with the freaking, right?",9,6
monica,"No, it just remind me of something this guy did today    at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?",9,6
chandler,"Yeah, he came up...",9,6
monica,"Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there,    but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.",9,6
chandler,Were you there?,9,6
phoebe,"No, but it sounds like it was freaking funny...",9,6
sandy,"I really do understand how hard it's got to be to leave    your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your    heart...",9,6
rachel,"Sandy, that is exactly what it is...",9,6
ross,Are you gay?,9,6
rachel,Ross!,9,6
sandy,It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I    am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.,9,6
rachel,Oh!,9,6
sandy,Her name is Deliah.,9,6
rachel,"Oh, that is pretty.",9,6
ross,So you are just like a... guy who's a nanny?,9,6
sandy,"I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people,    but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is    take care of a child.",9,6
ross,Okay.,9,6
sandy,"Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three    weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person...    When I left, I said",9,6
ross,"Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.",9,6
rachel,"Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.",9,6
sandy,"Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...",9,6
rachel,"Oh, that would be great!  I love him, I love him, I love him...",9,6
ross,"Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!",9,6
rachel,"So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good    reason we shouldn't try him out.",9,6
ross,"Because, it's weird!",9,6
rachel,Why?,9,6
ross,What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's    like if a woman wanted to be...,9,6
rachel,Yes?,9,6
ross,King?,9,6
sandy,I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made    lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that    rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young...,9,6
rachel,Please?  YES! Sandy you are hired.,9,6
sandy,that is great!  I'm    sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you are welcomed into a new    family...,9,6
rachel,Oooh... come here.,9,6
ross,You got to be at least bi...,9,6
chandler,"Hey!  I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica    is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.",9,6
joey,Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering    lines.,9,6
chandler,"Well, thank God your    livelihood doesn't depend on it.",9,6
joey,"I know, right?     Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?",9,6
chandler,Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy    she's ever met.,9,6
joey,Seriously? She actually said that?,9,6
chandler,Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?,9,6
joey,No! Being funny is your thing!,9,6
chandler,Yeah!,9,6
joey,"Without that, you just got ""lame with women"".",9,6
chandler,Ye....,9,6
monica,Hi! There you are.,9,6
joey,Fire trucks!,9,6
david,"Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.",9,6
phoebe,Oof...,9,6
david,"In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now.",9,6
phoebe,"Oh, wait, wait!",9,6
david,"Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that.    I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...",9,6
phoebe,"No, no, it's not that.     Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well,    uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.",9,6
david,Oh... oh...,9,6
phoebe,"Yeah, I should have told you.",9,6
david,"No... well, yeah.",9,6
phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",9,6
david,"Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well,    are you happy with this guy?",9,6
phoebe,I am happy.,9,6
david,"Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want    you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that is not fair. Uh, who cares,    leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I    should probably uhm... go...",9,6
phoebe,"Well... but David, just... I just want you to know    that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things    I've ever had to do.",9,6
david,Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly    a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?,9,6
phoebe,"Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss    on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...",9,6
david,No... no...,9,6
phoebe,I mean...,9,6
david,In Minsk...,9,6
phoebe,Yeah?,9,6
david,...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm...    and one on the lips.,9,6
phoebe,"Well, if that is what they do in Minsk...  In New York...    it's...",9,6
rachel,Oh... Oh boy...  Hi...,9,6
ross,Is everything all right?,9,6
rachel,"Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiance and it was just so beautiful.",9,6
sandy,"Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the    poem...",9,6
rachel,I can't... I can't hear it again.,9,6
sandy,"You know, I can't tell it again...",9,6
ross,"And I'm fine never having heard it...  Rach, can I... can I see    you for a sec?",9,6
rachel,Yeah!  Excuse me...,9,6
ross,Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three    times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.,9,6
rachel,"Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive,    that is all.",9,6
ross,"Okay, okay, see... that... that    is the problem. He is too sensitive.",9,6
rachel,What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?,9,6
ross,"Yeah, I mean, all things    that guy...  These are amazing!",9,6
rachel,Sandy made Madeleines.,9,6
ross,"This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What    kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even...    butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.",9,6
rachel,"Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say...    I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men.    You know, Because I got to tell you Ross, it not like you just came in    from branding cattle.",9,6
ross,Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.,9,6
rachel,"Okay, what? What is too sensitive?",9,6
phoebe,"Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.",9,6
david,"But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and    good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.",9,6
phoebe,"No, no. No.",9,6
david,But... ergo...,9,6
phoebe,"Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah,    we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with    Mike and I really care about him...",9,6
david,Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul...    ui...,9,6
mike,"Well... hey, the key works...!",9,6
phoebe,And you thanks for the    face massage. Thank you.,9,6
ross,Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?,9,6
monica,Yeah! I think that is great!,9,6
ross,"Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites    poetry and bakes Madeleines?",9,6
monica,Oh... How are they?,9,6
ross,Lighter than air...  But that is not the point.,9,6
joey,Hey!,9,6
ross,Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.,9,6
joey,Really...? Guys do that...? that is...    weird...,9,6
ross,Thank you!,9,6
joey,that is like a woman wanting to be a...,9,6
ross,...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?,9,6
monica,Yes... What is the end of that sentence?,9,6
joey,"Uhm... A penis model.  Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler    that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?",9,6
monica,"Yeah, so?",9,6
ross,Wow!,9,6
joey,Really? Do you not know Chandler?,9,6
monica,"Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...?    Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...",9,6
joey,"So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing...    You know, like Ross's thing is...",9,6
ross,Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?,9,6
joey,...No...,9,6
monica,I can't believe he's that upset about this...,9,6
joey,"Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay.   Because he's feeling like...",9,6
chandler,Hey!,9,6
joey,Hey! Hey!,9,6
chandler,What are you guys talking about?,9,6
ross,Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.,9,6
chandler,You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?,9,6
chandler,"You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do    draw the line at a male wetnurse.",9,6
monica,"oh, ooh... you are on a roll, mister!",9,6
chandler,"If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would    have brought more pizza.",9,6
monica,"Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!",9,6
chandler,What is so funny about that?,9,6
monica,"Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say    it... I mean, you are funny... You have that funny thing. you are a funny guy!",9,6
chandler,Did you tell her what we talked about?,9,6
joey,Yeah....,9,6
chandler,So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?,9,6
monica,"Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with    Geoffrey.",9,6
chandler,Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?,9,6
monica,"Well, you are... you are different funny... I mean,    you are... you are more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions...    and... and limericks...",9,6
chandler,"I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named    Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.",9,6
monica,"Honey, you know I think you are hilarious! Come on,    you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the    girl with the lazy eye...?  That slayed me.",9,6
ross,Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!,9,6
joey,Not knowing when to shut up...,9,6
ross,Yep! that is my thing...,9,6
mike,So... how many guys have your key?,9,6
phoebe,"No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... it's    not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.",9,6
mike,Your lipstick's on his mouth.,9,6
david,"Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.",9,6
phoebe,"No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years    ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.",9,6
mike,Did you uhm...,9,6
phoebe,"No, no...",9,6
mike,...kiss him?,9,6
phoebe,"Oh, well, yeah...",9,6
david,"Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes    you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella.",9,6
mike,Don't point your finger at me.,9,6
david,Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?,9,6
mike,Well... I'll... just show you what I'm going to do about    it...,9,6
phoebe,"Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt!     Here David, you    should just go.",9,6
david,"All right... But... if I ever do come back    from Minsk...  well, you just better watch out.",9,6
mike,"Well, if I ever go to Minsk, you'd    better watch out.",9,6
david,"Oh, you are going to Minsk?",9,6
mike,"Well, I might.",9,6
david,"Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just    lovely there.",9,6
phoebe,"Okay, well... guys?",9,6
david,Right... Goodbye Phoebe.,9,6
mike,"Hey, what are you kidding me?",9,6
david,"Right-o, right-o...  Take good care of her.",9,6
phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your    key back, I totally understand.",9,6
mike,It's never going to happen again right?,9,6
phoebe,Right! Never! Never! I swear!,9,6
david,"I-I... Oh I...I just want to say uhm... if you do ever    come to Minsk, that is my number  We'll uhm... we'll    party up Vladnik style.",9,6
joey,"Yeah! All right! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught    me Hot-cross Buns.",9,6
ross,Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.,9,6
joey,No... Three Blind Mice goes like this...,9,6
ross,I swear to    God...!,9,6
sandy,Who's up for puppets?,9,6
joey,Me! I'm up for puppets!,9,6
sandy,"Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants    to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's going to be the Grumpus?",9,6
ross,"Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed    to appreciate puppets?",9,6
sandy,Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours    help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us.,9,6
joey,I want to be mr. Wigglemunch.,9,6
ross,Oh my God!,9,6
sandy,"Well, I guess we know who's going to be the Grumpus...",9,6
rachel,That was kind of rude!,9,6
ross,"Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps    for me.",9,6
rachel,"You know, he was just doing his job...",9,6
ross,"Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one    who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I    can't go through with this.",9,6
rachel,"Oh, come on Ross...",9,6
ross,"No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force    you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...",9,6
rachel,Oh... that is true.,9,6
ross,Thank you!,9,6
rachel,"Well, you are the one who wants to fire him, so you are    going to have to do it.",9,6
sandy,"So you see Wigglemunch, that is    why it's important to share...",9,6
joey,I am learning so much from you.,9,6
chandler,"Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend    has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.",9,6
monica,"Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey    told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.",9,6
chandler,Really...? See... that is the thing,9,6
monica,"Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.",9,6
chandler,I love you too.  And... I like you as a friend.,9,6
joey,All right. See you later!,9,6
chandler,See ya!,9,6
joey,Did that guy really make that joke?,9,6
monica,"Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing    so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.",9,6
ross,Here goes...,9,6
rachel,I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.,9,6
ross,"Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kind of need to talk. I'm afraid    it's not working out.",9,6
sandy,Oh...,9,6
ross,"Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great...    with Emma... uhm... We just feel...",9,6
rachel,YOU! You feel!,9,6
ross,I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right.    I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...,9,6
sandy,"Oh, no, no, no... that is okay. I got a lot of offers    from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.",9,6
rachel,"Oh, damn you Geller!",9,6
ross,"Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.",9,6
sandy,"No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever    is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem?    Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.",9,6
ross,"No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's    uhm... my issue.",9,6
sandy,What is it...?  Please...?,9,6
ross,"You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with    a guy who's as sensitive as you.",9,6
sandy,"that is fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think    that is?",9,6
ross,Why... I... I don't know.     Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?,9,6
sandy,hmmm...,9,6
ross,"I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was    kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.",9,6
rachel,Huh ha ha!,9,6
ross,"I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get    the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.",9,6
sandy,That must have been hard.,9,6
ross,"It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom...    playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father    walks in and says... he says... ""What are you doing with those things?    What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like    a... like a real boy?",9,6
sandy,But you are a real boy!,9,6
ross,"I know I am!  ...And when it's    summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?",9,6
sandy,It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos    out.,9,6
ross,Here come some more...,9,6
sandy/grumpus,"And what's the one kind of boat that can never,    ever sink?",9,6
joey,What kind?,9,6
sandy/grumpus,A friend-ship...,9,6
joey,Wow! You blow my mind...,9,6
sandy,"Oh, I got to go.",9,6
joey,Aaahh... How much do I owe you?,9,6

joey,Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?,9,7
chandler,How come?,9,7
joey,"Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and    I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.",9,7
monica,What do you do with your money now?,9,7
joey,"Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank.     I didn't say that! It's in    a bank guarded by robots!",9,7
chandler,Do you have any ideas?,9,7
joey,"Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going    in on an emu farm. That'd be kind of cool huh? Pitching' in on the weekends, helping    to plant the emus...",9,7
monica,Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.,9,7
joey,Yeah! Right!  People eat    birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you    go to a restaurant and you say,9,7
monica,"Joey, I think you should consider something a little    less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment. The    Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible.     that is right, I know some stuff!",9,7
joey,"Real estate, huh? Hmmm...",9,7
monica,"Oh, and you know who's selling a great    apartment? Richard!",9,7
chandler,"Oh, and you know whose knowledge    of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!",9,7
monica,My dad told me. They play golf together.,9,7

rachel,"Oh yeah, she can't be herself.",9,7
phoebe,"Okay, so... all right... Which dress?  You can say ""neither"".",9,7
rachel and monica,"Oh God, neither!",9,7
monica,"I'm sorry honey, but we're going to take you shopping.    It's going to be fine.",9,7
rachel,"Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm    so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a    little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like",9,7

rachel,"Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?",9,7
ross,"I uhm... Well, I sang...  well actually    I rapped... Baby Got Back...",9,7
rachel,You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song    about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?,9,7
ross,"But you know what, if you think about it, it actually    promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm...    juicy doubles.",9,7
rachel,owwwww...,9,7
ross,Please don't take her away from me!,9,7

joey,"Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not    good enough for you?",9,7
chandler,"We're not going to have this conversation again...    Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this    huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about    losing Monica to a real man!  You don't think he's here, do you?",9,7
joey,"You know what it is? It's a nice place but I got to see    I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see...  Yeah,    I could see it.",9,7
chandler,"Look at these videos. You know, I mean,    who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my    God!",9,7

bitsy,"Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself...    So where are you from?",9,7
phoebe,"Uhm... Okay, well, alight, uhm... Originally    I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went    to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a    burned out Buick LeSabre for a while...  which was okay,    that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, Because this pimp spit    in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm...    a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money    but at least I don't pay taxes, huh...  So...    where does everyone summer?",9,7
phoebe,God! God! This is not going well.,9,7

phoebe,So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets    his good looks from...,9,7
theodore,Oh... Well...,9,7

theodore,"No, I'll be fine... I just should check the stitches...",9,7
phoebe,"I really, really am sorry.",9,7
theodore,How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in    the stomach?,9,7

mike,"Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of    internal bleeding.",9,7
phoebe,"Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted    to thank you again for having me here tonight.",9,7
bitsy,"Well, not at all...",9,7
phoebe,Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful    man your son is.,9,7
bitsy,"Thank you, I think so too.",9,7
phoebe,"Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how    he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.",9,7
bitsy,Is he really?,9,7
phoebe,Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings    and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle    lover.,9,7
bitsy,E-e-excuse me?,9,7
phoebe,"Oh no,    no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No,    no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...",9,7
bitsy,that is... my boy.,9,7
mike,Awesome!,9,7
chandler,"I'm not going to watch it... I don't NEED to watch    it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching?  Well, we    know I'm going to watch it.",9,7
joey,"Hey dude, what's up?",9,7
chandler,"Don't judge me, I'm only human!",9,7
joey,Did you take that tape?,9,7
chandler,"I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and    you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need    to know what was on it?",9,7
joey,I don't know. Whom I'm married to?,9,7
chandler,Some girl...!?,9,7
joey,She hot?,9,7
chandler,Yeah...!?,9,7
joey,How did she get me to settle down?,9,7
chandler,"All right, I'm going to watch it... I mean look, it's    probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly    be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head...  Can it?",9,7
joey,Guess I don't know. My experience,9,7
chandler,Then you are going to have to watch it for me.,9,7
joey,What? Whoo... What?,9,7
chandler,"Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is...    Please?",9,7
joey,"All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only    yourself to blame...",9,7
chandler,Why am I hearing cheering?,9,7
joey,"Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.",9,7
chandler,Football? Just football?,9,7
joey,"Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.",9,7
chandler,It's football... It's just football... This is great!    This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to    get a beer...     What the...     What are you doing?,9,7
joey,You don't want to see what I just saw!,9,7
monica,"What are you guys doing?  Oh my God, is that Richard?",9,7
rachel,"Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please?    Please laugh for mommy...  Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty    rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? Because mommy can rap...  My    name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't    rap... All right sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I    know that you are not going to tell anybody...  I    like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when    a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face...  Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhh! Oh!  I like big butts and    I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you are laughing!    Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little    weirdo...",9,7
ross,Hey!,9,7
rachel,"Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing.    It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...",9,7
ross,"Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her    to laugh?",9,7
rachel,"Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ...    I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...",9,7
ross,You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?,9,7
rachel,Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...,9,7
phoebe,"...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly    cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that is the end of the song...    I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen    minutes.",9,7
mike,Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that    one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?,9,7
phoebe,"Oh, Pervert Parade?",9,7
mike,No...,9,7
phoebe,"Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?",9,7
mike,Stop!,9,7
phoebe,Oh God! Is that veal?,9,7
mike,"Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian.",9,7
bitsy,Oh!,9,7
phoebe,"Oh no, no, no, no... that is okay, that is okay... I    mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...",9,7
mike,Phoebe you don't have to eat...,9,7
phoebe,"No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals",9,7
mike,So...? What do you think?,9,7
monica,So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?,9,7
chandler,Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn    star!,9,7
monica,That tape was never meant to be seen by...     Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.,9,7
joey,"Monica, look... I don't think you and I have    any secrets anymore...  Not ready to joke about    it yet, okay, I see you later.",9,7
monica,Why in the world would you take this tape and and    why would you watch it?,9,7
chandler,"Because that is who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature    man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just would    be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and    moustaches.",9,7
monica,Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?,9,7
chandler,This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not    over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.,9,7
monica,"Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that    is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.",9,7
chandler,"Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a    moustache!",9,7
monica,"Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each    other. that is all that matters.",9,7
chandler,"Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling    around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...",9,7
monica,Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole    life!,9,7
chandler,"Oh, good, good. Play more, Because I want to see how    it ends.",9,7
monica,that is NOT ME!,9,7
chandler,What...? that is not you! Life is good again! Ride    them cowgirl!,9,7
monica,That bastard taped over me!,9,7
chandler,Is that a problem?,9,7
monica,"I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank    tape, Doctor!",9,7
theodore,I can't imagine what he sees in her.,9,7
bitsy,"She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife    of his.  Oh, hello dear...",9,7
mike,"Hey, what's going on?",9,7
bitsy,We were just chit-chatting. How's your friend?,9,7
mike,A little better.,9,7
bitsy,"By the way, do you know who's moving back into town?    Tom and Sue's daughter Jen.",9,7
theodore,"You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well    behaved and... single.",9,7
mike,I'm not interested.,9,7
bitsy,"Oh, please darling, let's be honest. You can have all    the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real...",9,7
mike,"All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight    is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time,    but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are...",9,7
bitsy,"Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth!",9,7
mike,"So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't    bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept    the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love...",9,7
bitsy,The woman you what?,9,7
phoebe,Yeah... The woman you what?,9,7
mike,The woman I love...  I love you...    Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my    parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've    ever met in my life...,9,7
phoebe,I love you too...,9,7
mike,You do?,9,7
phoebe,YEAH...! How great is this...?,9,7
mike,want to get out of here?,9,7
phoebe,Okay.,9,7
mike,"Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.",9,7
phoebe,I had a great time.  It was really top drawer.    And here's something rich,9,7
ross,"She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.",9,7
rachel,So fellas,9,7

ross,Baby got back,9,7
rachel,"One more time from the top... I like big butts    and I cannot lie, you other br...",9,7
ross,Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!,9,7
monica,"Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?",9,8
chandler,"Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our   wedding china today?",9,8
monica,"No, I think we should save our china for something   really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.",9,8
chandler,"Honey, she keeps cancelling on us, take the hint.",9,8
monica,"What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.",9,8
chandler,What is the point of having them if we never use   them?,9,8
monica,"Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen   comes over..",9,8
chandler,I will explain it to her.,9,8
monica,"Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you   talk to the queen.",9,8
joey,"wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those   horses can crap.",9,8
tv announcer,"Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.",9,8
chandler,Muskogee! that is like four hours from Tulsa. Woo   hoo!   TV announcer,9,8
joey,Oh my God!,9,8
chandler,Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime   soap Days of Our Lives?,9,8
joey,Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I   can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.,9,8
chandler,What are you going to do?,9,8
joey,"I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really   good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me.   They sat us all down yesterday and said ""Everyone has to be there at 6",9,8
chandler,Well you proved them wrong.,9,8
joey,Yeah.,9,8
rachel,Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What   are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.,9,8

phoebe,"Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.",9,8

joey,"Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a   raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said ""Hey don't eat that-that is Phoebe's"" and he said.. He said.. ""Joey you stink at lying."" What am I going to do?",9,8

rachel,God she is unbelievable.,9,8
ross,"I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.",9,8
rachel,"Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a   restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.",9,8
amy,Stupid Thanksgiving.,9,8
rachel,What? What happened?,9,8
amy,"My boyfriend cancelled on me. I mean.. I I finally find   a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then   his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married   guys.",9,8
ross,Don't say that.,9,8
amy,Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to   be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi.,9,8
rachel,"Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk   to you in private?",9,8
ross,"Sure, you want to go upstairs?",9,8
rachel,Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I   would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.,9,8
ross,"You know, I think that's a great idea. It'll be like   the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.",9,8
rachel,"Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has   no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I   would like them to bond.",9,8
ross,"Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I   don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.",9,8
rachel,"Ross, you know what? She may need one. We're just   going to have to make our peace with that!",9,8
rachel,Hi.,9,8
everyone there says,"Hi, hey.",9,8
rachel,"Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.  This is   Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.",9,8
everyone,Hi.,9,8
amy,Oh my god. you are on Days of Our Lives.,9,8
joey,Yeah.,9,8
amy,wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.,9,8
joey,Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.,9,8
ross,Hi.,9,8
monica,Hi.,9,8
monica,Hey you.,9,8
monica,So. Welcome. Is this your first time you are   seeing Emma?,9,8
amy,Yeah I.. I think so. It's nice to meet you Emma.,9,8
phoebe,Phoe-Be.,9,8
amy,Oh. that is a funny noise.,9,8
joey,"Pheebs, I still need some help here",9,8
phoebe,"Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell.   but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when   you are talking, people know you are lying.",9,8
joey,Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know..   I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrific actor.,9,8
phoebe,You are a terrific actor.,9,8
amy,Hey. Hey where's the baby?,9,8
rachel,Oh we just put her down for a nap.,9,8
amy,Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible?   If you guys died.,9,8
ross,Thank you   Amy.,9,8
amy,"no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it   would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her,   then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then   I'd get married.",9,8
phoebe,that is a great movie.,9,8
amy,"Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything because you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.",9,8
ross,Emma.,9,8
amy,"Emma, Ross wants you.",9,8
phoebe,PHOE-BE.,9,8
amy,Why does she keep making that   noise?,9,8
rachel,"Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um,   if something were to happen to Ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby.",9,8
amy,Well who would?,9,8
ross,"Well we haven't officially asked them yet, but we would   want Monica and Chandler.",9,8
chandler,I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.,9,8
monica,"yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.",9,8
amy,"I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die   and I don't get your baby?",9,8
rachel,"See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.   We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected   to the baby.",9,8
amy,Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's  a lump.,9,8
chandler,"You know, guys I got to say. This means so much   to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica   and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts   about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two....",9,8
amy,This guy? Seriously?,9,8
monica,Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.,9,8
ross,Woah. Woah... Woah.,9,8
monica,"Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will   not be well received.",9,8
joey,Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's?   Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?,9,8
monica,"No, honey, its. that's a special plate.  See   its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.",9,8
joey,I can't believe I won.,9,8
amy,Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you   would give your baby to these strangers over me.,9,8
rachel,Monica is Ross' sister.,9,8
amy,"No, Ross' sister was really fat.",9,8
monica,That was me.,9,8
amy,"No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that   used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.",9,8
rachel,Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.,9,8
monica,"Okay, listen I know you are having a little   bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I   mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.",9,8
monica,"Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets   face it you have fun.",9,8
amy,"Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate   lady dies, then do I get the baby?",9,8
chandler,"No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?",9,8
rachel,Well actually...,9,8
chandler,Actually what?,9,8
ross,"well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma   would go to my parents.",9,8
chandler,What?,9,8
amy,"Hurts, doesn't it?",9,8
joey,Uh.. who has to die for me to get her?,9,8
chandler,"So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough   to raise Emma?",9,8
ross,"No,  that that is not what we're saying.",9,8
joey,Yeah he's lying. He looked down.,9,8
chandler,Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incompetent?   Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!,9,8
rachel,"Honey, you are taking this the wrong way. We think   you are going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you are more the fun parent.",9,8
ross,Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like   Monica who is more uh. uh disciplinarian.. someone who can be firm and strict.,9,8
monica,"That's not how you see me, is it?",9,8
phoebe,No you are all about the fun.,9,8
chandler,"Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do   you really think I'm not capable?",9,8
ross,"No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you are   strongest when.. when you are together.",9,8
chandler,Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.,9,8
ross,"Sure, Monica would have to give her up.",9,8
joey,"I lie better then that, right?",9,8
chandler,"So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends   die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left   in my life gets taken away from me?",9,8
phoebe,There's your movie!,9,8
monica,Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.,9,8
chandler,Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise   poorly?,9,8
monica,Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about.   I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of   Merlot and a five year old condom.,9,8
chandler,"Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong   father figure and I never will be.",9,8
monica,No you learn these things. You grow into it.,9,8
chandler,"Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said   was exactly why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody   knows it.",9,8
monica,I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because   I think you are going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard   parts.,9,8
chandler,"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""Go   to your room! you are grounded""?",9,8
monica,"Can you hear me say ""you are grounded""?",9,8
chandler,You said that to me last week.,9,8
monica,How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.,9,8
joey,The producer from Days left a message   on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed   off at me.. And they all got to meet Santa!,9,8
phoebe,It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's   easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the   parade because you had a family emergency.,9,8
joey,"Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because   I had a family emergency.",9,8
phoebe,"Ooh, what happened?",9,8
joey,Oh.. My sister's   raccoon.,9,8
phoebe,No! Nothing with a raccoon.,9,8
joey,"Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it.",9,8
monica,Oh wait.. What are you doing?,9,8
joey,Setting the table.,9,8
phoebe,Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy   china for dessert too.,9,8
monica,Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses   on my wedding dress.,9,8
ross,"Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.",9,8
chandler,"Oh no that's okay, you are totally right. I don't   know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I   want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.",9,8
amy,"Ucch. Uchh. In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.",9,8
rachel,UCHH!,9,8
amy,You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.,9,8
rachel,Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when   I died and didn't give you my baby?,9,8
amy,"This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I   mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my career.",9,8
rachel,What? What career?,9,8
amy,Um.. I'm a decorator.,9,8
rachel,Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you are a   decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.,9,8
amy,Why can't you ever be supportive?,9,8
rachel,Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even   come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.,9,8
amy,Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in   the hospital when I was getting my lips done.,9,8
rachel,I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving   Emily to you.,9,8
ross,Emma.,9,8
rachel,Oh whose side are you on? I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responsibility of a child.,9,8
amy,How hard could it be? You do it.,9,8
joey,ooh ooh..,9,8
amy,Do you want to know why you don't want  me to have   the baby?,9,8
rachel,uh huh.,9,8
amy,Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have   always been jealous of me.,9,8
rachel,"Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsibility? You,   your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?",9,8
amy,"Uh.. To name a few.  You know.. You know.. You've   just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't   have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do   you even realize how much that hurt me?",9,8
rachel,Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!,9,8
amy,"Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.",9,8
rachel,"I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here   today.",9,8
amy,"Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called   sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.",9,8
rachel,ah ha ha. ah ha ha. It's forty five.,9,8
amy,"You bitch. You just think you are so perfect. With your   new baby and your, your small apartment. Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute.",9,8
ross,"Too far, Amy. Too far.",9,8
rachel,You take that back.,9,8
amy,No.,9,8
rachel,Take it back!,9,8
amy,No! What are you going to do? Make me?,9,8
rachel,"Hey man, I work out.",9,8
amy,So do I.,9,8
rachel,I do pilates.,9,8
amy,I do yoga.,9,8
rachel,Bring it on!,9,8
monica,Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the   boxes!,9,8
rachel,Did you just push me?,9,8
amy,"Uh, yeah I think I did.",9,8
rachel,Alright. that is it!,9,8
monica,Forget the bubble wrap! There isn't time!,9,8
rachel,Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!,9,8
phoebe,Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?,9,8
joey,What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello   on them.,9,8
rachel,Ew! Gross.,9,8
chandler,"Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and   you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't   be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones   I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize   to her right now.",9,8
amy,I'm sorry.,9,8
rachel,"Mon, I'm so sorry.",9,8
chandler,Okay. That's better. Now I want you to both apologize   to each other and mean it.,9,8
amy,Sorry.,9,8
chandler,"By the way, that fight was totally arousing.",9,8
ross,"Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel   dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.",9,8
chandler,Oh yeah? Well thanks.,9,8
ross,"So, so now do I get Joey?",9,8
chandler,"Okay, but you should know he eats five times a   day and shoves pennies up his nose.",9,8
rachel,Are you okay Mon?,9,8
monica,uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a   plate. Its not like somebody died.,9,8
phoebe,It's all right. You can mourn.,9,8
monica,Thank you. It was so beautiful. I'm going to go to Joey's and get the pies.,9,8
joey,"Actually its not pies, its just pie.",9,8
monica,I don't care. Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.,9,8
rachel,"Look Amy, it got a little of control.. Um.. and I'm   sorry. you are my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..",9,8
amy,So you are going to give me the baby?,9,8
rachel,Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren   discount.,9,8
amy,You are not going to regret this.,9,8
rachel,She needs changing.,9,8
chandler,"Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-competent   and totally responsible and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there   Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.",9,8
phoebe,"Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?",9,8
chandler,Nope...,9,8
phoebe,"Broke them all, huh?",9,8
chandler,Yep...,9,8
phoebe,You going to tell her?,9,8
chandler,"Nope...  Hey... so I'm going to...   put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should   use these plates again for a long time.",9,8
monica,Like only if the queen comes?,9,8
chandler,Maybe not even then.,9,8
joey,"Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had   a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie   Pheebs.",9,8
phoebe,No problem! Next week,9,8
monica,Bye plates!,9,8
joey,"Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?",9,8
monica,What? Something happened with the plates?,9,8
joey,Uhm...  Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came   in...,9,8
jo lynn,"This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy    in the cat condo is Jinkies.",9,9
chandler,Yep.  that is a lot of cats Jo Lynn.  Single are ya?,9,9
chandler,Chandler Bing.,9,9
joey,Hey.  How come you are answering your own phone?  Where's your crazy assistant?,9,9
chandler,What's up Joe?,9,9
joey,"Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?",9,9
chandler,Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?,9,9
joey,"No, no, no.  When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to    be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .  courtside!",9,9
chandler,Courtside?  Oh my God.,9,9
joey,Yeah.  Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with    his knee.,9,9
chandler,that is so cool.  I'll let Monica know.,9,9
monica,Hello?,9,9
chandler,Joey just called.  He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and    me tomorrow night.,9,9
monica,"Really?  But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.     If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.",9,9
chandler,"But hey, it's courtside.  The cheerleaders are going to be right    in fr. . .   that is not the way to convince you.",9,9
monica,"Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, ""You    can't go to the game.  You have to spend time with me.""  So, if you could just    realize it on your own . . .",9,9
chandler,"I know.  you are right.  I want to see you too.  I've just got to    figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?  He's really looking forward to this.",9,9
monica,Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.  Tell him    that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.  Tell him that    what little time we have is precious.,9,9
chandler,"Yeah, ah, ah . . .  I'll think of something.",9,9
ross,"Wow!    Wow, You look . . . uh . . .   It's just, ah . . .   That    dress . . . uh . . .",9,9
rachel,"Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.",9,9
ross,"Well, well, they're good.  It's been a while since I've seen you like    this.  You, you clean up good.",9,9
rachel,"Oh well, well thank you.    Okay,    stop.  Stop looking at me like that.  The last time that happened,  that happened.",9,9
ross,"Oh right, right.    So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night    away from Emma?",9,9
rachel,"Yeah, yeah.  Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.  And thank    you for watching the baby, by the way.",9,9
ross,"Oh, it's fine.  Actually, I, I invited Mike over.",9,9
rachel,Phoebe's Mike?,9,9
ross,Yeah.,9,9
rachel,I didn't know you guys hung out.,9,9
ross,"We don't.  But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.  You know,    maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.",9,9
rachel,Oh that is so cute,9,9
ross,"I don't know.  But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.     He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.  He's been divorced; I have some    experience in that area.",9,9
rachel,Yeah.,9,9
phoebe,Hi,9,9
rachel,Hey.,9,9
phoebe,Ooh.  Girl's night out indeed.,9,9
rachel,"Ok.  So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night,    but if you need anything Ross . . .",9,9
ross,"Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?  You go have fun.",9,9
rachel,Okay.  You too.  And I hope you score.   Bye.,9,9
mike,Bye.,9,9
ross,So . . .  Welcome.,9,9
mike,I got beer.,9,9
ross,I got bottled breast milk.,9,9
mike,"Eh, why don't we start with the beer?",9,9
ross,"Okay.    So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.",9,9
mike,Yeah.,9,9
ross,"You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.",9,9
mike,Ah?   Do you have one here?,9,9
ross,No.,9,9
mike,Okay.,9,9
ross,"Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced.  Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe    said you . . . You've been divorced?",9,9
mike,"Yeah.   Yeah, I'm sorry.  I don't . . . I don't really like to    talk about it.",9,9
ross,that is okay.  We'll talk about  something else.,9,9
mike,"So, you are a palaeontologist, right?",9,9
ross,Yeah.,9,9
mike,My cousin's a palaeontologist.,9,9
ross,"Ah?    Well, he and I would probably have    a lot to talk about.",9,9
monica,Hi.,9,9
chandler,Hey.,9,9
monica,Welcome home.,9,9
chandler,"Oh well, look at you.",9,9
monica,Yeah.  What do you think?,9,9
chandler,"Well, it looks great.  It's just that . . . well, I'm wearing the    same thing underneath.  So . . .",9,9
monica,Oh.,9,9
chandler,See what I mean . . .,9,9
joey,Hey!  How come the door's locked?,9,9
monica,Just a second.,9,9
chandler,"No, no, no, no, no.  Joey can't know that I'm here.",9,9
monica,Why not?,9,9
chandler,"Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks    game.  So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.",9,9
monica,"So, you lied to him?",9,9
chandler,Achhh.  It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.       Except with you.,9,9
joey,Hey!  Open the door.  What's going on?,9,9
joey,What are you . ..    Why are you dressed    like that?,9,9
monica,"Oh, because, um . . .  well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple    of days.  So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.",9,9
joey,"Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.",9,9
monica,"Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.  You know,    like, ""Hi, How do I look?""   ""Really sexy.  Could I BE any more    turned on?""",9,9
joey,"Okay.       Whoa, whoa.  Why are there two glasses of wine out?",9,9
monica,Because. . .  one of them is for you.,9,9
monica,"Cheers.    Okay, buh-bye.",9,9
chandler,"You know, it's funny.  I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction    myself.    Hi ya.",9,9
monica,You might want to keep practicing.,9,9
chandler,Yah.,9,9
chandler,It's Joey.    Hey Joe.,9,9
joey,"Dude, come home!",9,9
chandler,What? Why?,9,9
joey,COME . . .  HOME.,9,9
chandler,"Look I, I can't.  What's going on?",9,9
joey,"I don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica's cheating'    on ya.  I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.",9,9
joey,"All right look.    If you can't come home and    deal with this, then I'm going to.",9,9
chandler,NO!,9,9
joey,I just heard him!,9,9
chandler,Can you . . . hear him . . . now?,9,9
joey,"No.   All right, I'm going in.",9,9
chandler,No! Wait!,9,9
joey,I heard him again!,9,9
chandler,"All right, look.  Just stay there.  I'm    coming home.",9,9
joey,Okay.  Great.  I'll see you when you get here.  I'm going to wait out in    the hall in case the dude comes out.,9,9
chandler,Is that really necessary?,9,9
joey,Absolutely.  You'd do it for me.  Not that you ever have to because I    know how to keep my women satisfied.,9,9
ross,"Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?  I mean, they said thirty minutes    or less.  Well, how long has it been?",9,9
mike,"Eleven minutes.   And now twelve.     So, do you like the beer?",9,9
ross,"I do.  I do.  Although, it's actually a lager.",9,9
mike,huh.   What's the difference between beer and lager?,9,9
ross,I don't know.  We could look it up.,9,9
mike,Things are about to get wild.,9,9
phoebe,Oh God.  Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around    talking about you and Ross?,9,9
rachel,Oh God.  It seems like forever ago.,9,9
phoebe,"I know.     So, what's going on with you and Ross?",9,9
rachel,"Well, um . . . I don't know.  I mean, for a long time nothing.  But    you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah    . . . little thing.",9,9
phoebe,Oh my God!  I love things.  What happened?,9,9
rachel,"Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked.  And, ah, then we    had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.",9,9
phoebe,Eye-contact?,9,9
rachel,Mm-hmm.,9,9
phoebe,I hope you were using protection.,9,9
waiter,"Excuse me.  Um, these are from the two    gentlemen at the end of the bar.",9,9
rachel,Oh.   Should we send them something back?,9,9
phoebe,Ooh.  Let's do.  Let's send them mashed potatoes.,9,9
rachel,"No!  Wait!  No, no.  Don't do that!  that is going to make them think    they can come over here.",9,9
phoebe,So?  What if they do?,9,9
rachel,"Well, we're not here to meet guys.  You have a boyfriend, I have a    b. . . baby and a Ross.",9,9
phoebe,"Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen.  We're just having fun.     You know, not everything had to go as far as ""eye-contact.""",9,9
monica,"Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you are not in Tulsa.",9,9
chandler,"Don't you think it's better for him to think that you are cheating    on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?    I heard it.",9,9
monica,I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.,9,9
chandler,All right.  I've got a plan.  I'll go down the fire escape.,9,9
monica,"Yes, because all good plans start with, ""I'll go down the fire escape.""",9,9
chandler,"Hear me out woman.  I'll go down the fire escape.  Then, I'll wait    for a while.  Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got    back from Tulsa.  Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy    in here.",9,9
monica,Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?       I heard it.,9,9
chandler,I'm just going to wait for a little while.,9,9
monica,Scary pigeon's back?,9,9
chandler,It's huge.,9,9
rachel,Oh my God.  I can't believe you live in that building.  My grandmother    lives in that building.  Ida Green?  No sense of personal space?  Kind of smells    like chicken?  Looks like a potato.,9,9
bill,"""Spuds"" is your grandmother?",9,9
rachel,that is my bubby!,9,9
kevin,"So, we're on our way to a couple of parties.  Um. . . maybe we can get    your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.",9,9
phoebe,"Yeah. . . I'm sorry.  We weren't really looking for anything to happen    with you guys.  I, I have a boyfriend.",9,9
rachel,"I don't know.  He was cute, and he liked me.  It was an impulse.",9,9
phoebe,What about Ross?  What about your moment?  Don't you want to talk to    Ross about it?,9,9
rachel,"No.  No, because I know exactly how the conversation's going to go.  ""Hey    Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before.""",9,9
rachel,"""Yeah.""    ""Me too.""",9,9
rachel,"""Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about    it.""",9,9
rachel,"""Yeah.""   ""Me neither.""",9,9
rachel,"""Well, should we just continue to live together and not    really tell each other how we're really feeling?""",9,9
rachel,"""Yeah.  That works for me.""",9,9
phoebe,"Yeah, I see what you mean.  By the way, nice Ross imitation.",9,9
rachel,"Oh, thanks.",9,9
phoebe,"But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.",9,9
rachel,Wha. . . hey!,9,9
phoebe,Better!,9,9
rachel,"Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments    with Ross, you know?  I should just . . . move on with my life.",9,9
phoebe,Really?  you are moving on from Ross?,9,9
rachel,I don't know.  Do I have to decide right now?,9,9
phoebe,"Well, you kind of just did.  That guy is going to call you tonight.     Ross is going to pick up the phone and that is a pretty clear message.",9,9
rachel,"Oh God, Ross.  Ross is going to pick up the phone.  Oh, I have to get    my number back.    Oh my God.     He's gone.",9,9
phoebe,"""Oh, I have to get my number back.  Oh my God.     He's gone.""   Dead on.",9,9
mike,"Ya know, I'm going to take off.",9,9
ross,So soon?,9,9
mike,"Well, yeah.",9,9
ross,"Okay.  Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.",9,9
mike,"Ah, you mean lager.",9,9
ross,Ah yeah.  Good times.,9,9
mike,Oh.,9,9
mike,Hello?,9,9
phoebe,"Hey, Mike, it's me.  Listen,    is um, is Ross near you?",9,9
mike,"Uh, no.  I just left.",9,9
phoebe,"Well, you have to go back in.",9,9
mike,"Wha . . .?  Go back?  To the ""land where time stands still""?",9,9
phoebe,"I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and,    um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.  So, you have to intercept all    his calls.",9,9
mike,I can't do that!,9,9
phoebe,He says he can't do that.,9,9
rachel,"Oh give me , , ,    Hi, Mike?  Hi.     Listen.  I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?  If you do this I .    . . Phoebe will . . . do anything you want.  Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.",9,9
phoebe,"All right.   Hello?  Hi.  I'm sorry    about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.",9,9
mike,"All right.  I'll do it.      But really, how much dirtier can it get?",9,9
phoebe,"Oh, Mike.  Bye.",9,9
mike,Hey buddy.,9,9
ross,"Uh, hi.",9,9
mike,"Um, can I come back in?",9,9
ross,Why?,9,9
mike,"I, I was just thinking about how much more we    have to talk about.",9,9
ross,But you left.,9,9
joey,"Wow!  That didn't take long.  I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three    hour flight.",9,9
chandler,"Well, you are forgetting about the time difference.",9,9
monica,Chandler!  you are home!,9,9
chandler,"that is right.  you are husband's home.  So, now the sex can stop.",9,9
monica,What are you saying?,9,9
chandler,Joey said that you are in here with another man.,9,9
monica,There's no man in here.  How dare you accuse me of that.,9,9
joey,"All right.  All right.  Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend    take a look around, huh?    Bwa-ah-ah!",9,9
chandler,What is he doing?,9,9
monica,I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.,9,9
joey,"Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.",9,9
chandler,"All right.  Well, I'll check the guest room.",9,9
joey,Why do I smell men's cologne?,9,9
monica,I think that is you.,9,9
joey,Oh yeah.  I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.,9,9
chandler,There's nobody here Joe.,9,9
joey,I guess not.,9,9
monica,I can't believe you thought I was cheating.   You    own me an apology.,9,9
joey,"Yeah, right Monica.  I'm so sorry.",9,9
monica,"Ah, it's an honest mistake.  It could    happen to anyone.  All right, see ya.",9,9
joey,"Whoa,    whoa.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  If you just got back from Tulsa, how    did your suitcase beat you here?",9,9
chandler,I climb down the fire escape and you    can't put that in the closet?,9,9
mike,"So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the    same thing.  Fascinating isn't it.",9,9
ross,"Maybe you should look up ""fascinating.""",9,9
mike,I'll get it.   Hello?  Ross's place.  Mike speaking.      It's for you.,9,9
ross,I don't understand what just happened    here.,9,9
joey,What's going on?,9,9
chandler,"I'm sorry.  I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend    the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . .  I didn't think you'd understand.",9,9
joey,"What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be    with his wife?  Huh?  Do you think I'm like, ""Duh.""",9,9
monica,Joey?,9,9
joey,Yeah?,9,9
monica,I don't know what to say.  We shouldn't have lied to you.,9,9
chandler,Yeah.  I feel so bad.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to    you?,9,9
joey,"Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know    you said you couldn't.  But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a    bump on the head.",9,9
chandler,I'm sorry.  that is the one thing I can't do.  I promised I'd be with    Monica.,9,9
joey,All right.,9,9
monica,You can go.,9,9
chandler,What?,9,9
monica,You should go to the game.  It's okay.  I want you to.,9,9
chandler,Really?  you are going to be okay?,9,9
monica,"Yeah, I'll be fine.  You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the    art of seduction.",9,9
chandler,"you are going to put on sweats and clean, aren't you?",9,9
monica,It's going to be so hot!,9,9
chandler,"Okay, bye.",9,9
monica,Have fun.,9,9
joey,Thanks.    Here's your ticket.,9,9
chandler,"Hey, listen.  I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?  And I want    you to know that nobody thinks you are stupid.",9,9
joey,Thanks man.,9,9
joey,Where are you going?,9,9
chandler,Game's tomorrow night Joe.,9,9
rachel,Hi.,9,9
ross,Oh God.,9,9
rachel,Oh . . .,9,9
mike,I'm so glad you are back.,9,9
phoebe,Oh.,9,9
rachel,"Wow.  So, what did you guys do?",9,9
ross,"Oh, you know . . . we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries    of normal social conduct.",9,9
mike,It's true.  I did.,9,9
phoebe,"Well, good bye.",9,9
rachel,That was fun Pheebs.,9,9
phoebe,I know.  That was fun.,9,9
rachel,See you guys.,9,9
ross,"Rachel, lock the door.  Lock the door,  seriously.",9,9
rachel,"Oh shoot.  I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks.    Wait, wait.  Sorry.  Did he call?     Did that guy call?",9,9
mike,No.  Just his mom.,9,9
rachel,"Oh, around 8",9,9
mike,Yeah.,9,9
rachel,"Then, again at 9",9,9
mike,uh-huh.,9,9
rachel,Yeah.,9,9
ross,"Hello.    Ah, no, she's not here right now.  Can I take a message?       Bill from the bar?    Okay, ""Bill from the bar.""     I'll make sure she gets your number.",9,9
rachel,Aah.,9,9
ross,"So, ah . . . So, how was it?   Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have    a good time?",9,9
rachel,"Oh, it was so much fun.  It felt so good to be out.",9,9
ross,"Uh, Rach.",9,9
rachel,Yeah?,9,9
ross,Never    mind.,9,9
ross,Hey you guys.,9,9
mike,Hey.,9,9
phoebe,Hey.  I'll be right back.  I've got to go to the bathroom.,9,9
mike,Stout.  that is a kind of beer.,9,9
phoebe,"...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle; and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, ""Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!""",9,10
joey,"Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?",9,10
phoebe,Uh-huh.,9,10
chandler,"Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.",9,10
monica,I can't believe you are not going to be here for Christmas.,9,10
ross,you are really not coming back?,9,10
chandler,"Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.",9,10
monica,"It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!",9,10
chandler,"So, who does?",9,10
phoebe,"Oh, I like my job.",9,10
joey,I *love* my job.,9,10
rachel,"Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.",9,10
ross,I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!,9,10
chandler,"I'm sorry, I won't be here.",9,10
monica,"It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.",9,10
chandler,Thanks.  I'll see you New Year's Day.,9,10
monica,you are not going to be here New Year's Eve??,9,10
chandler,Did I not mention that?,9,10
monica,No!,9,10
chandler,,9,10
chandler,"All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call  for writing ""Screw you, Mr. Bing!"" on the back of my chair!  -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.",9,10
wendy,Hey!,9,10
others,Hey.,9,10
chandler,Hey. Where've you been?,9,10
wendy,"I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole their ham.",9,10
chandler,"You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's going to smell like ham in here.",9,10
claudia,My kid's in a play right now.,9,10
chandler,"You know what, I know what will cheer you guys up!  I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told them about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.",9,10
ken,"""A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet"".",9,10
chandler,"Well, that is like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!",9,10
wendy,*Now* it feels like Christmas.,9,10
chandler,"I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, which, by the way, none of you have invited me to.",9,10
ken,You can come to my house!,9,10
chandler,"Haha, no thanks!",9,10
wendy,That was a nice pep-talk.,9,10
chandler,"Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.",9,10
wendy,"So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?",9,10
chandler,"Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...",9,10
phoebe,"So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me.",9,10
rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.",9,10
chandler,"I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.",9,10
phoebe,"Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.",9,10
rachel,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.,9,10
chandler,What? that is terrible!,9,10
phoebe,"No-no, we do it every year!",9,10
chandler,"Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.",9,10
phoebe,"No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.",9,10
rachel,"Don't worry, we're just going to search here for an hour, and then we're going to go over to Joey's and search, OK?",9,10
chandler,"No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!",9,10
phoebe,"Oh no, we have to!",9,10
chandler,"No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.",9,10
phoebe,"Well then, you should look with us.",9,10
chandler,Why?,9,10
rachel,"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?",9,10
chandler,"No, I have a great idea for a present for her.",9,10
phoebe,"Oh, that is it?  A great idea! Oh yeah.",9,10
rachel,"Chandler, that is not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that is just going to make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?",9,10
chandler,"If I help, we can find them faster!",9,10
rachel,that is right!,9,10
phoebe,"Ooh ooh, we have a live one!",9,10
rachel,"Oh, it's a Macy's bag!",9,10
rachel,Oh.,9,10
phoebe,"Ooh, who's it for?",9,10
rachel,"""Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.",9,10
joey,"Rach, these are for you.",9,10
rachel,Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.,9,10
joey,"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.",9,10
chandler,"OK, Pheebs, your turn.",9,10
phoebe,"Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?",9,10
joey,Uh-huh.,9,10
phoebe,You guys.,9,10
joey,"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.",9,10
ross,You got me a cola drink?,9,10
chandler,"And, a lemon lime.",9,10
ross,"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.",9,10
chandler,And last but not least.,9,10
joey,They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.,9,10
ross,"Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?",9,10
ben,Cool!,9,10
ross,Yeah!,9,10
monica,Come on Ben.,9,10
ross,Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...,9,10
chandler,"Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!",9,10
ben,Santa!,9,10
chandler,Hey!,9,10
ross,"What are you doing here, Santa?",9,10
chandler,"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?",9,10
ross,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?",9,10
chandler,What?,9,10
monica,"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.",9,10
ross,What are you doing?,9,10
chandler,"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!",9,10
ross,"Thank you, but, but you, you got to leave.",9,10
chandler,Why?,9,10
ross,"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you are-you are wrecking it.",9,10
chandler,But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.,9,10
ross,"I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.",9,10
chandler,"Fine, I'll give the suit back.",9,10
monica,"Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?",9,10
chandler,Santa? Really?,9,10
monica,"Yeah, is that okay?",9,10
chandler,Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?,9,10
monica,No.,9,10
chandler,Then it's okay!,9,10
chandler,"You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.",9,10
chandler,"Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.",9,10
chandler,"Good, God's speed, good people!  you are not going to go?",9,10
wendy,Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.,9,10
chandler,Ah. Thanks.,9,10
wendy,"Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.",9,10
chandler,Ah.  Chandler Bing.,9,10
monica,Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.,9,10
others,Merry Christmas!,9,10
phoebe,Ble-blah-blar Blargh!,9,10
chandler,"Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!",9,10
monica,So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?,9,10
chandler,"Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.",9,10
monica,Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.,9,10
chandler,It is. Did I... not tell you about her?,9,10
monica,"Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?",9,10
chandler,I sent them home.,9,10
monica,"OH, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?",9,10
chandler,"Uhh, uh...",9,10
ross,"Answer faster, answer faster!",9,10
chandler,I don't know!,9,10
ross,"Answer better, answer better!",9,10
chandler,"I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.",9,10
monica,What does she do there?,9,10
chandler,"Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.",9,10
monica,She did WHAT?,9,10
chandler,BE-LOW me!,9,10
joey,"Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?",9,10
monica,*What*??,9,10
chandler,"Well, she... she didn't win...",9,10
monica,"Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.",9,10
chandler,"Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...",9,10
rachel,"Oh Chandler, stop talking!",9,10
chandler,"Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.",9,10
monica,Okay.,9,10
chandler,I'm serious!,9,10
monica,Okay!,9,10
chandler,Merry Christmas.,9,10
monica,Merry Christmas.,9,10
chandler,"Merry Christmas, you guys!",9,10
others,"Yeah, Merry... Christmas.",9,10
phoebe,"Blah blargah, blar-blab.",9,10
chandler,"The wife says ""Hi!"".",9,10
wendy,Ah. Fun conversation?,9,10
chandler,"Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, you know, just because you and I are alone, that something is going to happen.",9,10
wendy,"Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible?",9,10
chandler,"This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you are getting ham on my only tie.",9,10
chandler,"Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!",9,10
wendy,...Missy?,9,10
chandler,I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...  Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?,9,10
wendy,You are to me...,9,10
chandler,"No,... no...  NO!  Look, I'm, I'm married!",9,10
wendy,So? I'm married.,9,10
chandler,I'm *happily* married.,9,10
wendy,Oh. - What's *that* like?,9,10
chandler,"Right. So, I'm sorry...",9,10
wendy,"Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?",9,10
chandler,"Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case",9,10
wendy,"Okay, let me ask you something",9,10
chandler,"I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!",9,10
monica,Really?,9,10
chandler,You kidding? you are the most beautiful woman in most rooms...   Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?,9,10
monica,"Well, not anymore.",9,10
chandler,But we don't do that.,9,10
monica,"I know, I just thought it would be fun.",9,10
chandler,How drunk are you?,9,10
monica,Drunk enough that I know I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.,9,10
chandler,that is the perfect amount!,9,10
monica,Okay!,9,10
monica,You know what's weird?,9,10
chandler,What?,9,10
monica,This doesn't feel weird!,9,10
chandler,I know.,9,10
monica,you are a really good kisser.,9,10
chandler,"Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you want to get under the covers?",9,10
monica,Hm-hmm!,9,10
chandler,Okay!,9,10
monica,Wow! You are really fast!,9,10
chandler,It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.,9,10
monica,We're going to see each other naked.,9,10
chandler,Yep!,9,10
monica,Do you want to do it at the same time?,9,10
chandler,Count of three?,9,10
monica,One!,9,10
chandler,Two!,9,10
monica,Two!,9,10
both,Three!,9,10
chandler,Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.,9,10
monica,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!",9,10
chandler,Eh!,9,10
chandler,"So, are you really going to go out with that nurse man?",9,10
monica,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.",9,10
chandler,"You know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just want to spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, you know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.",9,10
monica,I think you are better than you think you are.,9,10
chandler,"Really? Okay, so...",9,10
monica,Know when to stop.,9,10
chandler,"You know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?",9,10
monica,Yeah.,9,10
chandler,Right!,9,10
monica,"I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.",9,10
chandler,"Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.",9,10
monica,you are so efficient. I love you!,9,10
chandler,Let's go!,9,10
monica,"No-no-no, wait! We need something old!",9,10
chandler,"Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.",9,10
monica,That'll work!,9,10
chandler,I don't think so.,9,10
monica,"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!",9,10
chandler,Here just...take this.,9,10
monica,that is stealing!,9,10
chandler,"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.",9,10
monica,OH.,9,10
chandler,"Okay, one thing at a time.",9,10
monica,"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.",9,10
chandler,Ehh.,9,10
monica,"Eh, you work for that.",9,10
chandler,"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.",9,10
monica,You do?!,9,10
chandler,"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that is what we're going to do.",9,10
monica,"Oh, you are so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?",9,10
chandler,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, you know? We'll pick our favourite and that one will get to go to college.",9,10
monica,You thought about that?,9,10
chandler,Yeah.,9,10
monica,How many kids were we going to have?,9,10
chandler,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",9,10
monica,What else did you think about?,9,10
chandler,"Well, stuff like where we'd live, you know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. You know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",9,10
monica,"You know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.",9,10
chandler,Sure you do.,9,10
monica,"No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.",9,10
chandler,You sure?,9,10
monica,Uh-hmm.,9,10
chandler,I love you so much.,9,10
monica,I love you.,9,10
rachel,"Ooh, I love it!",9,10
ross,Really? you are not going to return it?,9,10
rachel,"Well, not this second!",9,10
phoebe,"Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!",9,10
rachel,"Oh wow, it's so beautiful...",9,10
ross,"Wow, it really is!",9,10
monica,"""Wendy"" is a fat girl name.",9,10
phoebe,Aren't we done with that?,9,10
monica,"Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?",9,10
chandler,Hey!,9,10
ross,Oh my god...,9,10
joey,"Hey-hey - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!",9,10
monica,What are you doing here?,9,10
chandler,I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.,9,10
joey,"Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?",9,10
chandler,Monica.,9,10
joey,Got ya.,9,10
chandler,I never want to leave you again!,9,10
monica,"But I thought if you left, you get fired.",9,10
chandler,Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.,9,10
monica,What?,9,10
ross,"What, you, you really quit your job?",9,10
chandler,"Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?",9,10
rachel,What do you really want to do?,9,10
chandler,I have *not* thought this through!,9,10
monica,Oh my god!,9,10
chandler,"I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.",9,10
monica,"No, I think that this is what you want to do, I think it's great!",9,10
chandler,Thanks!,9,10
phoebe,"Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.",9,10
chandler,Ahh...,9,10
phoebe,Now give me my real gift.,9,10
phoebe,Thank you.,9,10
chandler,"Here, pass these, will ya..",9,10
ross,"Oh, hey...",9,10
ross,"""A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet."" -- How did you know?",9,10
rachel,Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.,9,10
chandler,"I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.",9,10
joey,Mine's is to Lilian Myers.,9,10
chandler,I don't have a *job*!,9,10
chandler,Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer…,9,10
monica,"You are!  Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?",9,10
chandler,Hey!,9,11
monica,"Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. you are going to get me good and pregnant.",9,11
chandler,I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm going to do with my life.,9,11
monica,"Well, I just lost my erection.",9,11
chandler,"I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?",9,11
monica,you are supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you want to be now. It's exciting.,9,11
chandler,But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.,9,11
monica,"Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!",9,11
chandler,Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!,9,11
monica,I know!!! My erection is back!,9,11
joey,Thank you!,9,11
phoebe,"Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?",9,11
joey,Okay.,9,11
joey,,9,11
phoebe,"I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.",9,11
joey,If you want I could loan you some money?,9,11
phoebe,"Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that is why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.",9,11
joey,"Oh, hey, how about this? want to be an extra on my show?",9,11
phoebe,You could do that?,9,11
joey,"Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.",9,11
phoebe,"Oh my god, I'm going to be on TV!",9,11
joey,"Okay, now. I got to tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.",9,11
phoebe,"Oh, really?",9,11
joey,No it is awesome!,9,11
ross,Hi guys.,9,11
all,,9,11
phoebe,"Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?",9,11
ross,Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?,9,11
joey,She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?,9,11
rachel,"Well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" I'm going to whip them with a car antenna!",9,11
ross,"I think she's going to be the hit of the office, huh? She's going to be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?",9,11
monica,"Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.",9,11
chandler,How long was I in there?,9,11
monica,Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.,9,11
chandler,Wait. Advertising! that is a great idea!,9,11
monica,Don't you want to look through the rest?,9,11
chandler,"I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.",9,11
monica,"You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!",9,11
chandler,"I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? ""Cheese. It's milk that you chew."" ""Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?""",9,11
monica,"I got one. ""Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best.""",9,11
chandler,Honey? Leave it to the pros.,9,11
monica,I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.,9,11
chandler,"""The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones.""",9,11
monica,"""Marriage. It's not for everybody.""",9,11
rachel,That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.,9,11
ross,"Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.",9,11
rachel,I'm just going to go in my office and pick up some stuff .  Who the hell are you!?,9,11
guy,Who the hell are you?,9,11
rachel,I'm the hell person whose office this is!,9,11
ross,"Good one, Rach.",9,11
guy,"I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job.",9,11
rachel,Excuse me?,9,11
gavin,"Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy?",9,11
phoebe,"Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!",9,11
joey,"Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?",9,11
phoebe,Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.,9,11
joey,"Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.",9,11
director,"Okay, okay, okay!  You. Here, come here, here. you are going to take this tray, you are going to stay on this yellow mark. you are going to move on ""action!"" you are going to walk over to the operating table. you are going to stop on that blue mark, you are going to put the tray down. Don't walk too fast! But don't doddle.",9,11
phoebe,"Okay, now. What?",9,11
director,And...Action!!,9,11
director,Cut! Cut!,9,11
phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.",9,11
director,"Well, don't be.",9,11
phoebe,"Okay, that helps.",9,11
director,And...Action!,9,11
director,Cut!,9,11
joey,"Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too!  Alright, eight.",9,11
director,And...Action!,9,11
interviewer,"So, do you have any other question about advertising?",9,11
chandler,"No, no. But let me show you what I can do. ""Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood.""",9,11
interviewer,Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency.,9,11
chandler,Really? that is great!,9,11
interviewer,It's an unpaid internship.,9,11
chandler,"It's funny. When you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid.""",9,11
interviewer,Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.,9,11
chandler,"Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's going to want to postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.",9,11
interviewer,Stop!,9,11
interviewer,Okay.,9,11
rachel,"Wait a minute! What do you mean, you are taking over my job?",9,11
gavin,"Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job.",9,11
rachel,A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.,9,11
gavin,Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.,9,11
rachel,"Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.",9,11
gavin,I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.,9,11
rachel,Excuse me?,9,11
ross,Rach we have a code brown situation.,9,11
rachel,"Can you please, please take care of it for me?",9,11
ross,"Alright, but you have to do one sometime.",9,11
rachel,Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?,9,11
gavin,"Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together.",9,11
rachel,that is right. you are very cheeky for a temp.,9,11
gavin,I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.,9,11
rachel,"Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?",9,11
gavin,"Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit.",9,11
rachel,Did they mention that I'm rubber and you are glue?,9,11
mr. zelner,"Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.",9,11
rachel,"Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.",9,11
mr. zelner,"Rachel, I see you've met Gavin. I must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were going to do. But then, Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin!",9,11
rachel,"that is great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?",9,11
gavin,"Well, that is up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision.",9,11
rachel,"Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.",9,11
mr. zelner,"Incidentally, when are you coming back?",9,11
rachel,Today.,9,11
gavin,You said two weeks.,9,11
rachel,"No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.",9,11
joey,Hey.,9,11
phoebe,"Hey. So, what did he say?",9,11
joey,"Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm going to replace a word he used a lot, with the word ""puppy."" Okay, so he said",9,11
phoebe,"I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.",9,11
joey,"that is right, you are not. you are a nurse. you are Nurse With Tray.",9,11
phoebe,Joey.,9,11
joey,"No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!",9,11
phoebe,Who dies?,9,11
joey,Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.,9,11
phoebe,"Yes, doctor.",9,11
joey,Okay.,9,11
director,"Okay, let's try this one more time.",9,11
phoebe,"Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!",9,11
director,And...Action!,9,11
phoebe,"Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?",9,11
director,The rest of the scene.,9,11
phoebe,"Okay, from the top, people!",9,11
rachel,"Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were going to fire me.",9,11
ross,"What? No, that is illegal. I'm going to have the labour department down her so fast they won't even...",9,11
rachel,"Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's going to try to squeeze me out.",9,11
ross,What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.,9,11
rachel,"I know. You know, we're just going to have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?",9,11
ross,Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.,9,11
rachel,"Come on, I don't know what else to do.",9,11
ross,"Fine, fine.  We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will.",9,11
rachel,Ross?,9,11
ross,Huh?,9,11
rachel,you are pretty.,9,11
chandler,"Whatever I decide to do, I'm going to be starting a career from scratch. It's going to be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.",9,11
ross,So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?,9,11
chandler,Yeah.,9,11
ross,Good-bye.,9,11
monica,"Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing.  Didn't see you there Geller.",9,11
chandler,"Yeah, Ross is here so...",9,11
ross,"Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?",9,11
monica,We're going to have sex.,9,11
ross,I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.,9,11
monica,Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you are here or not.,9,11
ross,Pants off Bing!,9,11
rachel,"Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?",9,11
gavin,"Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Sync.",9,11
rachel,"Hey, they were popular when I left!",9,11
gavin,"Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.",9,11
rachel,"Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?",9,11
gavin,that is going to take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation?,9,11
rachel,"Oh, no no no no. I see what you are doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!",9,11
gavin,Fine.,9,11
rachel,Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?,9,11
gavin,"Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.",9,11
rachel,"Fine, I will.  Alright, fill me in!",9,11
ross,Hey.,9,11
chandler,Hey.,9,11
ross,You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.,9,11
chandler,"Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.",9,11
monica,"Hi, good morning lover. I got to say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.",9,11
ross,Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!,9,11
monica,Sorry.  But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.,9,11
chandler,"Oh god, I have to tell you something. you are not pregnant.",9,11
monica,What are you talking about?,9,11
chandler,That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.,9,11
monica,What!? You faked it?,9,11
ross,"You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual",9,11
phoebe,"Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?",9,11
joey,"Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.",9,11
phoebe,"Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? that is going to confuse my fans.",9,11
joey,"Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.",9,11
phoebe,"Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.",9,11
joey,Nice.,9,11
phoebe,Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?,9,11
joey,"No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.",9,11
phoebe,About what?,9,11
joey,He slept with you and then never called you.,9,11
phoebe,And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.,9,11
director,"Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action!",9,11
man,"So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.",9,11
joey,"I'm surprised to, but yet here I am.",9,11
director,"Cut, cut! What are you doing!?",9,11
phoebe,"Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.",9,11
extra,Me too!,9,11
another extra,Me too!,9,11
joey,"Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!",9,11
gavin,"Wow, you are here already.",9,11
rachel,"Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!",9,11
in,How do you fix the chair?,9,11
rachel,"Except that!  Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.",9,11
mr. zelner,"Good, because it's in ten minutes.",9,11
rachel,"What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not going to pick her up for another hour.",9,11
mr. zelner,"Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going helicopter shopping.",9,11
rachel,"Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock them dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!",9,11
gavin,You can do the presentation.,9,11
rachel,"No, I can't, I have a baby.",9,11
gavin,I'll watch her.,9,11
rachel,Why would you do that?,9,11
gavin,"Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you are a little crazy.",9,11
rachel,that is really nice.,9,11
gavin,I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.,9,11
rachel,"Then you are not going to like what's coming.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.",9,11
gavin,"I'm really fine, don't worry, I'm great with children.  Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.",9,11
joey,Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.,9,11
director,"Okay, okay. But this is her last chance.",9,11
joey,"Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?",9,11
joey,"Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?",9,11
phoebe,I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.,9,11
joey,you are a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.,9,11
phoebe,"Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. you are threatened.",9,11
joey,What?,9,11
phoebe,"Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni Because I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!",9,11
joey,"Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.",9,11
monica,You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!,9,11
chandler,Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.,9,11
monica,"Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that is ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?",9,11
chandler,"that is actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.",9,11
monica,Like a month?,9,11
chandler,Or a year?,9,11
monica,"Really, you want to wait a year?",9,11
chandler,"It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. ""Pants. Like shorts, but longer.""  It'll probably be more than a year.",9,11
monica,I really want to have a baby.,9,11
chandler,"Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.",9,11
monica,"No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.",9,11
chandler,I quit and you learn what I do?,9,11
monica,"It's just, I think, there's never going to be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you are unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always going to be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.",9,11
chandler,I guess. It's always going to be scary when we have a baby.,9,11
monica,"It's going to be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's going to be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's going to be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!",9,11
chandler,Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?,9,11
monica,"Yes, please!",9,11
chandler,"Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.",9,11
monica,I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!,9,11
joey,"I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother.",9,11
man,I'm not your brother.,9,11

chandler,"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.",9,12
joey,And you are not helping?,9,12
chandler,"I tried, but apparently singing ""I will survive"" in a helium voice    - not helping.",9,12
ross,Hey you guys!,9,12
joey and chandler,Hey! Happy birthday ...,9,12
rachel,"Shh don't say that loud, Gunther's going to want to hug me.",9,12
ross,"Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.",9,12
joey and chandler,Hi.,9,12
molly,Hi.,9,12
ross,"Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.",9,12
joey,"You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.",9,12
rachel,"Ok, you know what, I'm just going to take her outside.",9,12
molly,"No, you stay, I'll do it .",9,12
rachel,"OK, thank you.",9,12
molly,Nice to meet you guys .,9,12
joey,"Yeah, you too.",9,12
rachel,"Oh, wow, Molly is just great!",9,12
ross,Yeah.,9,12
chandler,"Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.",9,12
rachel,What? You really think she's hot?,9,12
chandler,Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.,9,12
rachel,And Joey?,9,12
joey,How do you think she's doing?,9,12
rachel,Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?,9,12
ross,"Eh, I mean, I mean she's not unattractive but hot? I ....",9,12
rachel,Thank you!,9,12
chandler,Now that Rachel's gone?,9,12
rachel,So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.,9,12
phoebe,"Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?",9,12
mike,Lima.,9,12
phoebe,"No. It starts with a ""v"" and ends with an ""x"". Helpfully    with a ""to"" in the middle.",9,12
mike,"You know, kind of think of it, the capital of Peru IS ""vtox"".     Oh god! Oh!",9,12
phoebe,What?,9,12
mike,"OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a    rat in your cupboard.",9,12
phoebe,"Oh, whew, no, that is Bob.",9,12
mike,"What, is he your pet rat?",9,12
phoebe,"Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who    I put food out for, you know. kind of like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on    the plate of cookies.",9,12
mike,"You can't keep a rat in your apartment! They're extremely unsanitary,    and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.",9,12
phoebe,What are those?,9,12
mike,I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get    rid of it!,9,12
phoebe,"OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.",9,12
mike,Thank you.,9,12
phoebe,"So weird, you think he's so gross and you are willing to eat his crackers.",9,12
rachel,Hello.,9,12
gavin,Hello,9,12
rachel,"Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma    yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an apology.",9,12
gavin,For what?,9,12
rachel,"Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous    and arrogant and obnoxious ...",9,12
gavin,Is this your first apology?,9,12
rachel,"No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And    I-I think you are a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.",9,12
heather,Good morning!,9,12
rachel,"Hello.  But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf,    I am just really really happy ...  I'm sorry,    obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait    'till it's finished.",9,12
gavin,What?,9,12
rachel,I was giving you an apology and you were totally checking her out!,9,12
gavin,"I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her    skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.",9,12
rachel,"Oh wow, you are really, you are really a creep.",9,12
gavin,Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?,9,12
rachel,"Oh yeah, I'm jealous. ""Oh Gavin, please, please look at    my ass"".  Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just    think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your    subordinate.",9,12
gavin,I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.,9,12
rachel,"That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know    that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had    a deep meaningful relationship.",9,12
gavin,Huh. What's Tag's last name?,9,12
rachel,"It was ...  oh my god. He didn't have a last    name. It was just ""Tag"". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.",9,12
gavin,But it was a deep meaningful relationship.,9,12
rachel,"Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely    right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name    was Morgan! Huh!",9,12
gavin,It was Jones.,9,12
rachel,"Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?",9,12
joey,"Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.",9,12
molly,"You mean, when you were a baby.",9,12
joey,Sure.,9,12
monica,Would you stop staring at her?,9,12
chandler,I wasn't staring. I was leering.,9,12
monica,What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind    of way.,9,12
ross,"Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there    in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me    feel like I earned it.",9,12
chandler,Looks like Joey is doing alight with her.,9,12
monica,"Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl    for once.",9,12
molly,I'm going to take her back to the apartment.,9,12
ross,"Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you    - wovyou do you ...",9,12
molly,Bye,9,12
monica,They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.,9,12
molly,I think it's sweet.,9,12
"ross, joey and chandler","Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.",9,12
rachel,"Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if    you didn't go after her.",9,12
joey,Why not?,9,12
rachel,"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything    to, you know, drive her away.",9,12
joey,"So, what, you think I'm just going to sleep with her and never call    her again and things are going to get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds    about right.",9,12
ross,"Come on, there are plenty of other women out there ok? Just - just    forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.",9,12
joey,"Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told    me I can't have it makes me want her even more!",9,12
ross,"What are you, a child?",9,12
joey,Yes!,9,12
ross,"Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy    on someone else.",9,12
joey,Fine.,9,12
monica,Take me home!,9,12
phoebe,Hey Mikey,9,12
mike,Hey P,9,12
phoebe,What are you doing?,9,12
mike,Setting rat traps.,9,12
phoebe,To kill Bob??,9,12
mike,"No, no, to test his neck strength.",9,12
phoebe,"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just going to    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possum and a wisecracking owl.",9,12
mike,"Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.",9,12
phoebe,"I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob?  Bob! Robert!  Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies!    Bob's a mom!",9,12
mike,Better think of a new name for him.,9,12
phoebe,"I don't know, I kind of like Bob for a girl.",9,12
mike,"I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...",9,12
phoebe,"Oh my god, we killed Bob!",9,12
mike,"Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.",9,12
phoebe,Suzie?,9,12
ross,Whizzed??,9,12
chandler,"Seriously dude, 3 years ago.",9,12
ross,"Listen, can you do me a favour? I'm going to be out today. Can you just keep    an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?",9,12
chandler,You don't trust him?,9,12
ross,"Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked    for her daughter, the ""hot nanny"".",9,12
chandler,"Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?    Because I could get a job any day now.",9,12
ross,"You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm    sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do    this for me?",9,12
chandler,"Alright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know    as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not,    he's going to have sex with it.",9,12
ross,"Well we got to do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.",9,12
chandler,Picturing that tree?,9,12
ross,"I am, yes.",9,12
chandler,"Where you going, Joe?",9,12
joey,For a walk.,9,12
chandler,Oh. You mind if I join you?,9,12
joey,"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.",9,12
chandler,Your thoughts? Plural?,9,12
joey,"Alright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I got to    see her!",9,12
chandler,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.",9,12
joey,"Now you are telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me!    She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?",9,12
chandler,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",9,12
joey,Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the    world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.,9,12
chandler,Great novels?,9,12
joey,Fine ... mediocre porn,9,12
gavin,Gavin Mitchelle's office.,9,12
rachel,"Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone!     Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll    pass you back to your son",9,12
gavin,"Hey Mom! No, that is just my secretary.",9,12
rachel,"Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.",9,12
gavin,"Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah.   Yes?",9,12
rachel,If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?,9,12
gavin,"Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your    pad three hours ago.  Man, I really bug you,    don't I?",9,12
rachel,"Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact,    from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to    you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now.",9,12
monica,Hey Rach!,9,12
rachel,Hi!,9,12
monica,Ready for your birthday lunch?,9,12
rachel,"Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce    you to my very talented college and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin    Mitchelle.",9,12
gavin,Pleased to meet you.,9,12
monica,Pleased to meet you. So you are coming to Rachel's party tonight?,9,12
rachel,"Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his    mother.",9,12
gavin,"Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.",9,12
rachel,Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!,9,12
monica,You were just being so nice to him!,9,12
rachel,I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?,9,12
rachel,"Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!",9,12
monica,Right there! That was so fake!,9,12
rachel,Shh!,9,12
rachel,"I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Alright, he is the    last person I want to see.",9,12
monica,"Oh, you are welcome for the party. I'm glad you are having a good time.",9,12
rachel,"God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not going to show up, the guy    hates me.",9,12
monica,Does he?,9,12
rachel,What?,9,12
monica,Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first    grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly    had a crush on me?,9,12
rachel,"Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet    to see if he can knock you over.",9,12
molly,"She's out, I'm going to take her home.",9,12
rachel,"Oh, ok, thank you.   Do you see what all the guys    see in her?",9,12
monica,Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!,9,12
joey,"Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?",9,12
rachel,"Yeah, sure!",9,12
joey,"Oh ...  Happy birth ...  oh, see you    later",9,12
monica,"Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!",9,12
rachel,"Oh, give me!",9,12
phoebe,"Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!",9,12
mike,Yeah. We have rat babies now.,9,12
rachel,"Ah , you brought rats to my birthday party?",9,12
monica,So this is what a stroke feels like.,9,12
phoebe,"I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility    now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you are    a mother.",9,12
rachel,Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?,9,12
phoebe,"No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed    them.",9,12
rachel,"whhh wait, you are going to leave my party to take care of a box of rats?",9,12
phoebe,"Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone    can afford help.",9,12
ross,Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.,9,12
chandler,"I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.",9,12
ross,We have to stop them before something happens!,9,12
chandler,"Right behind you, big guy!",9,12
joey,"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline.    It takes a lot of hard work.",9,12
molly,So where did you study?,9,12
joey,"Oh, I didn't go to college.",9,12
molly,"No, where did you study acting?",9,12
joey,Molly ... people don't study acting ...,9,12
ross,"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?",9,12
molly,"Sure, I'll go check on Emma.",9,12
ross,Thanx.,9,12
joey,Will the stable boy never get the princess??,9,12
ross,"What do you think you are going to do, have sex with her right here on my couch?",9,12
joey,"No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair.    What makes you think that I'm just going to sleep with her and then blow her off?    Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actually like her,    and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.",9,12
ross and chandler,Come on! Joe!,9,12
joey,Ok,9,12
woman,"Hi, is Molly here?",9,12
ross,"Yeah, come on in. Molly?",9,12
molly,"Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow.",9,12
ross,"Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have    no problem.",9,12
joey,"It's like my favourite fairy tale come true!  The    princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!",9,12
phoebe,"Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing    the box and then we got to put them straight to bed.",9,12
mike,"Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve    around their rats?",9,12
phoebe,"Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.",9,12
mike,"Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate    and there are hundreds of them?",9,12
phoebe,Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.,9,12
mike,"Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a ""love    the one you are with"" kind of animals.",9,12
phoebe,"No.  wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what    are we going to do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then    each of those have 7 rats? that is like ...     that is math I can't even do! What are we going to do?",9,12
mike,"Well, I know this is going to sound crazy, but, we could not let    the box of rats ruin our lives.",9,12
phoebe,"Yeah, ok. I guess you are right. Alright, so we should just give them away.    But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's    favourites.",9,12
mike,It's going to be ok.,9,12
phoebe,You must think I'm crazy.,9,12
mike,"No, I think you are sweet.",9,12
phoebe,"Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go.    I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to    my brother's triplets and I had to give them up.  I haven't    told you about that yet, have I?",9,12
monica,Hey!,9,12
rachel,"Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?",9,12
monica,"No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?",9,12
rachel,"Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.",9,12
monica,"Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from    your office didn't show up .",9,12
rachel,Mmm hmm.,9,12
gavin,"Yeah, hey.",9,12
monica,"Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.",9,12
rachel,No.,9,12
gavin,Nice party.,9,12
rachel,"Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at  ... 9",9,12
monica,"Again, you are welcome.",9,12
gavin,"Look, I'll just give you this and go.",9,12
rachel,"Oh, you bought me a present! Why?",9,12
gavin,"Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There    are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you    the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.",9,12
rachel,"Aww. Well, ok, well that is very nice. And you wrote a card . ""From Gavin""",9,12
gavin,I really mean it.,9,12
rachel,"Aww, aww, it's beautiful.",9,12
gavin,"You don't mind?  Well, what do you know, it fits!",9,12
rachel,"See, Gavin, you are capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such    a hard time?",9,12
gavin,I'm not sure.,9,12
rachel,Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.,9,12
gavin,I do have feelings for you.,9,12
rachel,You do?,9,12
gavin,"Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.",9,12
rachel,"See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion    of you, you go and you ...  and you do that ...",9,12
chandler,"First I was afraid, I was petrified",9,12
phoebe,Hey,9,12
chandler,Hi,9,12
phoebe,"Listen, I think I've left something here.",9,12
chandler,"Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?",9,12
phoebe,"No, but I like it. I think I left one of    my rat babies.",9,12
chandler,"Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.",9,12
monica,Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!,9,12
phoebe,"Ooh, maybe that is him!",9,12

chandler,Hey!,9,13
ross,Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what  happened here last night?,9,13
chandler,Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like  you! Do you believe that who ever did something over here last night did what  they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!,9,13
ross,OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?,9,13
chandler,No!,9,13
ross,OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from  her office out on your balcony.,9,13
chandler,"Our balcony? Seriously? that is so funny because I told Monica  we should put lights on our balcony. And she said ""No, no. It's too cold,  nobody will go out there."" And I said ""Maybe if we put some light out there they  will""",9,13
ross,"Right that is why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel  kissing some guy on your balcony, even though there were NO LIGHTS !",9,13
chandler,So are you going to...talk to her?,9,13
ross,"Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that is  fine!",9,13
chandler,"You know when ""that is fine"" sounds true when someone yells it  and spits!",9,13
ross,"No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care  but...at least she could have told me. You know...I've been putting my life  on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing  guys she barely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah!  Ah!",9,13
chandler,No no no. Good. So you are moving on? Do you have any idea where  you are moving?,9,13
ross,"I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now  there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me .And then the other  day on the subway a woman ""accidentally"" sat on my hand.",9,13
chandler,"Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!",9,13
ross,"Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who  totally came on to me during the inter-departmental Potluck dinner.",9,13
chandler,Why did I get married?!,9,13
joey,Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken  tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I should have my eyebrows  waxed. Is that weird for a guy?,9,13
phoebe,Well it depends.,9,13
joey,On...?,9,13
phoebe,On how far along he's in the sex change process!,9,13
monica,"No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do  something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to, your eyebrows  are...",9,13
joey,Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! you are freaking me out!,9,13
phoebe,Your knuckles are kind of hairy too...,9,13
joey,Oh man! I have to get those done too?!,9,13
phoebe,Wow! Talking about high maintenance,9,13
joey,Hey hey! You dye your hair!,9,13
phoebe,I'm a woman!,9,13
joey,Arghhh! Double standards!,9,13
phoebe,"Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar  tonight?",9,13
monica,Only if I don't have to get up and sing.,9,13
phoebe,"But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable  old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out and everyone  booed him off the stage. So funny.",9,13
monica,"It's just, I'm not good at singing.",9,13
phoebe,Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? you are afraid I'm a better  singer? you are afraid I'm going to beat you at singing?,9,13
monica,"No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!",9,13
phoebe,OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to  sing.,9,13
monica,So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass  judgments on others?,9,13
phoebe,While drinking...,9,13
monica,I'm there!,9,13
rachel,Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something  really stupid.,9,13
phoebe,Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out  there,9,13
rachel,No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.,9,13
phoebe,Oh my god.,9,13
monica,You kissed him?,9,13
rachel,"Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony  and...",9,13
monica,Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed  that?,9,13
phoebe,"It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping  paper.",9,13
monica,Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?,9,13
rachel,"You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me  and, oh and he gave me this scarf...",9,13
monica,I thought you hated him?,9,13
rachel,"You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and  it turns out that line...is a scarf!",9,13
monica,So are you thinking of starting up something with this  guy?,9,13
rachel,"I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you  know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't know what to do  and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.",9,13
monica,"Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin,  and you definitely should talk to Ross",9,13
rachel,Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...,9,13
phoebe,"Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you are back for four days, kiss  a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!",9,13
salon girl,Hi,9,13
joey,Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.,9,13
salon girl,Name?,9,13
joey,Chandler Bing.,9,13
salon girl,Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia  will be right with you.,9,13
joey,OK Thanks.. I touched the  stuff,9,13
sonia,I'll take care of it,9,13
joey,Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?,9,13
sonia,Oh absolutely.,9,13
joey,Oh good...,9,13
sonia,Are you looking to meet somebody?,9,13
joey,All right let's just do this.,9,13
sonia,"We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of  the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...",9,13
joey,Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My  face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right! Just a little bit of shock  that is all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK Dammit! Woman!! How How!,9,13
chandler,Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on  going?,9,13
ross,Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand  but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.,9,13
chandler,"Well maybe you are going about this the wrong way. You know I  mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times, two  illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....",9,13
ross,that is funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?,9,13
chandler,What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!,9,13
ross,I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to  me,9,13
chandler,"Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just  an impulsive one-time birthday thing",9,13
ross,"No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a  bar.",9,13
chandler,Did she go out with him?,9,13
ross,"No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.",9,13
chandler,Ah! The high road...,9,13
ross,You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey  check out those two blondes over there! Hey come with me!,9,13
chandler,Are you trying to get everybody divorced?,9,13
ross,"You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the  two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the ice with some kind of  jokes so that they know you are the funny one and I swoop in with some  interesting conversation, so they'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding,  sexy one...",9,13
chandler,I thought I had to make the jokes!,9,13
ross,Don't you have to be at work?,9,13
chandler,"Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend  Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you are up for it. We only  need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!",9,13
ross,Hum...So..hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the  paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question,9,13
blonde girl,Sorry...we were just leaving,9,13
chandler,We still got it!,9,13
rachel,Who is it?,9,13
gavin,Gavin! I brought you some soup.,9,13
rachel,Why?,9,13
gavin,I heard you were sick...,9,13
rachel,"Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little  bit! Hello Gavin",9,13
gavin,I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?,9,13
rachel,"I a not going to lie to you, I'm pretty sick",9,13
gavin,Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I  thought you called in sick to avoid me.,9,13
rachel,Oh no no no,9,13
gavin,So I had fun last night,9,13
rachel,So did I,9,13
gavin,Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold  for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?,9,13
rachel,It's just a cold,9,13
gavin,Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...,9,13
rachel,What? What's the matter?,9,13
gavin,What's Ross doing to you on that picture?,9,13
rachel,Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be  funny.,9,13
gavin,Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want  to get in the middle of anything,9,13
rachel,"Oh you are not. you are not going to get in the middle of anything,  don't worry about Ross really, really. Oh! Hide! that is Ross! Hide! Hide!",9,13
gavin,Yeah! But you said not to worry about...,9,13
rachel,I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!,9,13
molly,Hi!,9,13
rachel,Oh! Molly! you are not Ross.,9,13
molly,"No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?",9,13
rachel,"Right, right, yes!",9,13
molly,Don't panic!,9,13
rachel,What?,9,13
molly,There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my  purse.,9,13
rachel,No! that is OK! that is OK! that is OK! No no no no! This is my  business associate Gavin. He's just being silly. Gavin come out from behind  that curtain!,9,13
gavin,Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand  there.,9,13
molly,Hello! I just go and get Emma.,9,13
rachel,OK.,9,13
gavin,So hum...Why did I have to hide?,9,13
rachel,I thought it was Ross.,9,13
gavin,So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between  you two...,9,13
rachel,There isn't. There is totally isn't.,9,13
gavin,You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming  out of a chute for the first time. I used to be a rodeo clown.,9,13
rachel,"All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were  here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in any relationship  but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus  there is just so much history...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry,  I'm just all over the place.",9,13
gavin,It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a  piece of advice?,9,13
rachel,Yes,9,13
gavin,I think you should talk to Ross about all this.,9,13
rachel,People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin,9,13
gavin,Don't be. It's just bad timing.,9,13
rachel,So seriously...rodeo clown?,9,13
gavin,"One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...",9,13
phoebe,"""No time for losers, Because we are the champions of the  world...!"" Thank you!",9,13
mike,"Oh she's my girlfriend. that is not just how we do it here. I got to  get a break and when we come back we've got Kenneth singing ""I touch  myself""...I'm not here to judge!",9,13
phoebe,Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.,9,13
monica,No I told you I can't.,9,13
phoebe,But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice  voice.,9,13
monica,What have you heard me sing?,9,13
phoebe,All the time when you are cooking.,9,13
monica,What?,9,13
phoebe,"Yeah you are always singing ""Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in  my tummy""",9,13
monica,Yeah I do rock that one.,9,13
phoebe,OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up  there?,9,13
monica,Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I  would sing...,9,13
mike,Well I've got a book around...,9,13
monica,"""Delta Dawn""",9,13
ross,"Hi! I could help not notice, but that is an unusual necklace",9,13
woman,You already hit on me an hour ago,9,13
ross,"Right, so that is a firm ""no"". I cannot believe this, I just keep  striking out.",9,13
chandler,"I don't get it neither, I mean you are obviously desperate,  you are asking women how they want to be killed",9,13
ross,This is great. Rachel's going to keep kissing guys until she finds the  one she wants and I'm going to die alone.,9,13
chandler,By drowning or...?!,9,13
michelle,Why would he break up with me?,9,13
her friend,I don't know sweetie.,9,13
michelle,"All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back.  I mean, am I so unlovable?",9,13
chandler,Well...,9,13
ross,I know!,9,13
mike,"All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of  ""I touch myself"". Coming up next we've got Monica singing ""Delta  Dawn"".",9,13
monica,Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.,9,13
phoebe,"Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that  spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone anyway.",9,13
monica,"Hi! I'm Monica and I'm going to be singing ""Delta Dawn"" ""Delta  Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone  by? ...""",9,13
phoebe,Can you totally see through her shirt ?,9,13
mike,Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.,9,13
monica,"""To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?""",9,13
joey,"Hey, I need your help.",9,13
chandler,"Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley  Judd?",9,13
joey,"Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my  eyebrows shaped",9,13
chandler,"I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!",9,13
joey,"You may be a sissy but I'll still . All  right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one eyebrow and now... they  don't match!",9,13
chandler,It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!,9,13
joey,"All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic  marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so I don't look stupid for my  pictures.",9,13
chandler,"Ok. First of all, this is green!",9,13
joey,What the hell am I supposed to do!,9,13
chandler,"All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you  will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.",9,13
joey,"What, what.",9,13
chandler,"Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the  lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine by plucking the eyebrows  of my father and his business partners.",9,13
joey,Oh my God!,9,13
chandler,"Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor  Victoria!",9,13
joey,"Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help,  but Chandler I don't know if I can take anymore plucking. It hurts so  bad!",9,13
chandler,"Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my  gentle self-loathing touch.",9,13
monica,"""Take me to the mansion in the sky-y"". I am sorry, the song is  over. Did you see me out there?",9,13
phoebe,Every little bit of you!,9,13
monica,"I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I'm singing for the  people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that one shouting look at those  tips! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?",9,13
mike,Sure.,9,13
phoebe,"Mon', not that you didn't sound good, but...",9,13
monica,Good? Didn't you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for  making me do this. that is is the best gift ever.,9,13
mike,Also a good gift? Underwear.,9,13
michelle,"Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms  freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do anything else.",9,13
ross,"But, what's great is that you don't mind talking about it.",9,13
michelle,"It's so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with  me, because it's like you lose a boyfriend, you get a boyfriend.",9,13
ross,Uh-ah!,9,13
michelle,"No don't worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally  over Eric.",9,13
ross,. Good choice Ross.,9,13
rachel,"Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you  everywhere!",9,13
ross,"Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.",9,13
rachel,"Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o' clock.  So I was hoping you and I could have a chance to kind of talk- somebody  here?",9,13
ross,"Oh, yeah, yeah that is Michelle.",9,13
rachel,Who?,9,13
ross,"Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.",9,13
rachel,You've being seeing someone?,9,13
ross,"Yeah, didn't I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven't being going  out for too long, but rather there is this amazing connection between us. I-I  mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it  was a little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kind of nice.",9,13
michelle,What are you taking amoxicillin for?,9,13
ross,"How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look  through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that is my roommate, Rachel.",9,13
rachel,"Hi, and I am also Emma's mother.",9,13
michelle,"Ah, who is Emma?",9,13
ross,I told you about my daughter.,9,13
michelle,This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!,9,13
chandler,And done!,9,13
joey,"Oh my God! I didn't feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a  job because you can tweeze circles around that sadistic bitch at the  saloon",9,13
chandler,Thanks. You want to see what it looks like?,9,13
joey,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look  great! How you doing!",9,13
chandler,"Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little  worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about there, but it turned out to  be a little piece of chocolate.",9,13
joey,Thank you so much.,9,13
chandler,No problem.,9,13
joey,"Listen that is a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some  manly make up for it.",9,13
chandler,Yeah.,9,13
joey,Comb my eyelashes.,9,13
monica,"Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more  upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer Sisters I am so excited. And  make it bouncy!",9,13
phoebe,Oh you'll probably take care of that on your hands.,9,13
chandler,I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see  Joey.,9,13
monica,"Honey, you are just in time, I'm about to sing another  song!",9,13
chandler,Really? In front of all this people?,9,13
monica,And they love me!,9,13
chandler,Oh my God!,9,13
phoebe,"Yes, she gives the people what they want.",9,13
monica,"All right, watch!",9,13
monica,"""Tonight's the night we're going to make it happen, tonight we'll  put all other things aside. Give in this time and show me some  affection...""",9,13
chandler,Are those my wife's nipples?,9,13
phoebe,"Oh? Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have  let her go up again.",9,13
chandler,I got to stop this.,9,13
monica,"Oh, who cares, they still love me! ""I am so excited...""",9,13
chandler,"You, touching yourself, out!",9,13
rachel,Wow. She does that a lot!,9,13
michelle,"Ross, you didn't tell me you were a doctor!",9,13
rachel,"What, what, wait a minute! You haven't even told her you were a  doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like an hour?",9,13
michelle,Actually about an hour and a half.,9,13
ross,"I told you it wasn't long, but there is an amazing connection  between us.",9,13
michelle,"You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!",9,13
ross,Are you kidding?,9,13
michelle,"Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?",9,13
ross,We'll see.,9,13
rachel,"Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange  women back to the apartment now?",9,13
ross,"I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?",9,13
rachel,How do you know about that?,9,13
ross,"Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to  sleep...",9,13
michelle,Emma.,9,13
ross,"When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a  guy you know, for what? A week?",9,13
rachel,"Oh, that is what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to  get back at me?",9,13
michelle,"No, actually, see I had to pee, because I can't use public  bathrooms because the doodie parasites.",9,13
ross,"Ok, Michelle, it's time to go.",9,13
michelle,"Well, call me!",9,13
ross,Ok.,9,13
michelle,"No, wait, you don't have my phone number!",9,13
ross,"You know, if it's meant to be, I'll guess it. Bye, bye.",9,13
rachel,Score.,9,13
ross,"Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we  could come to one of your kissing parties on the balcony.",9,13
rachel,"Oh God, I can't believe you are making such a big deal about this.  It was one kiss, one guy, one time!",9,13
ross,"Oh, really!",9,13
rachel,Yeah.,9,13
ross,"Oh, really!",9,13
rachel,Oh yeah.,9,13
ross,What about the guy from the bar?,9,13
rachel,What? Who?,9,13
ross,The guy you gave your number to.,9,13
rachel,"Whoa, how do you know about that?",9,13
ross,"Because he called here looking for you. So don't tell me  this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing, ok? You've been  out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn't even  have the courtesy to tell me.",9,13
rachel,Why didn't I get that message?,9,13
ross,What?,9,13
rachel,"From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?",9,13
ross,Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you  not look there?,9,13
rachel,Ross?,9,13
ross,I never gave it to you.,9,13
rachel,Why?,9,13
ross,I don't know.,9,13
rachel,Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to  decide what messages I should or should not get?,9,13
ross,Who am I?,9,13
rachel,Yes.,9,13
ross,I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you are out at bars  meeting guys!,9,13
rachel,"Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in  here hoping to have a mature conversation with you About us! But I can't do  that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my  apartment!",9,13
ross,None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! that is not the  point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one Who moved on and didn't tell  anyone!,9,13
rachel,"Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What's wrong with us? You  know when people hear about our situation they always ask, what, you live  together but you are not a couple? And you have a baby, isn't that weird? And I  say No. You know what, it's not, because it works for us!» But you know this  doesn't work. In fact this is the opposite of working!",9,13
ross,"Uh, clearly.",9,13
rachel,"And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as  long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know, Just doesn't make sense  anymore.",9,13
ross,"Yeah, maybe not. So what you want to do?",9,13
joey,Hey!,9,13
rachel,Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?,9,13
joey,"Ha, oh, of course.",9,13
rachel,Thank you.,9,13
joey,Your eyebrows look weird.,9,13
chandler,"Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never  understood a single word he said, but I helped him drink his wine. So you  just touch yourself for anything?",9,13
joey,"Morning, roomie!",9,14
rachel,Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.,9,14
joey,Fifth day's a charm.,9,14
rachel,"Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I got to tell you, you are       making it so easy on me and Emma.",9,14
joey,"Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want,       and when does she stop crying all night?",9,14
ross,"Hey, you are not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you       tonight?",9,14
rachel,"Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's       in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep,       so...",9,14
joey,She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did       last night.,9,14
rachel,Bye!,9,14
ross,"Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.",9,14
joey,"No, hey, it's been great.",9,14
ross,Yeah?,9,14
joey,"Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying       here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?       And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using       a breast pump...",9,14
ross,"Yeah, that'll do it.",9,14
joey,"Wow! So, how are you?",9,14
ross,"I'm, I'm okay.",9,14
joey,Really?,9,14
ross,"Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have       worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's       a divorce.",9,14
joey,"Well, actually it...",9,14
ross,"No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel       and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing       other people.",9,14
joey,"Wow, really?",9,14
ross,"Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good       for me...",9,14
joey,"Sure, I know lots of girls.",9,14
ross,Yeah? Any names come to mind?,9,14
joey,"Ooh, names?",9,14
phoebe,Hey.,9,14
joey,Hey. I was just going to get something to eat. You want something?,9,14
phoebe,What you got?,9,14
joey,"Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,       strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.",9,14
phoebe,"Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart       from the great food.",9,14
joey,"I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with       her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.",9,14
phoebe,"Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.",9,14
joey,Why are they doing this?,9,14
phoebe,I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.,9,14
joey,"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in       here?",9,14
phoebe,I just wish they'd realise they should be together.,9,14
joey,"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured you know,       that is where things were headed.",9,14
phoebe,I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have       more children.,9,14
joey,"Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have       kids; someone's got to carry on the family name.",9,14
phoebe,"You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's       out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.",9,14
joey,"Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night",9,14
phoebe,"So, what are we going to do? Are we just going to go ahead and set them       up with people?",9,14
joey,I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.,9,14
phoebe,"Yeah.  Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel       up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.",9,14
joey,"Ooh, that is a great plan!",9,14
phoebe,"Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my ""plan-laugh.""",9,14
joey,"Shh! Not so loud, we don't want to wake up, uh...",9,14
rachel,Hey!,9,14
monica,Hey!,9,14
rachel,"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?",9,14
chandler,"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married?       I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll       excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.",9,14
rachel,I was just asking Because I need someone to watch Emma tonight.,9,14
monica,"Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?",9,14
rachel,"Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.",9,14
monica,Oh my god.,9,14
chandler,Wow.,9,14
rachel,Why? What's the big deal?,9,14
monica,"Just figured, Because you and Ross are...",9,14
rachel,"What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.",9,14
chandler,"Well, I think it's great that you are going on a date, you know? I       mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!",9,14
monica,"You want a job? Turn off ""Oprah,"" and send out a resume!",9,14
rachel,So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?,9,14
monica,"Oh, it's perfect.",9,14
rachel,"Oh, you guys are going to have so much fun! She's at such a cute age.       Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around       the clock. And watch out for your hair, Because she likes to grab it. And       oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody       murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!",9,14
chandler,Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.,9,14
phoebe,"Ooh, Joey.",9,14
joey,Hey.,9,14
phoebe,Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.,9,14
joey,All right! Who is he?,9,14
phoebe,"Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold       down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.",9,14
joey,"Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got       for Ross.",9,14
phoebe,"Oh, yeah.",9,14
joey,She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!,9,14
phoebe,A teacher?,9,14
joey,"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh,       oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?",9,14
phoebe,"Well, Ross does. What... you are - you are ruining the plan! Joey,       you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!",9,14
joey,"Oh my god, you are right!",9,14
phoebe,Yeah.,9,14
joey,She even reads for pleasure!,9,14
phoebe,How do you even know a woman like that?,9,14
joey,What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?,9,14
phoebe,Joey.,9,14
joey,I met her at the library. I went in to pee.,9,14
phoebe,So now what do we do?,9,14
joey,"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled,       and find him somebody else.",9,14
phoebe,"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the       date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets       stood up!",9,14
joey,Ooh...I hear that is bad.,9,14
phoebe,"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's going to have a terrible date, Ross       gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.",9,14
joey,"Ah, yes, The Plan!",9,14
phoebe,"It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...",9,14
joey,"Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.",9,14
phoebe,"No, I think we killed it.",9,14
chandler,"Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.",9,14
chandler,"No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go.       Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!",9,14
monica,"Okay, just so you know, I'm going to be ovulating from tomorrow until       the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.",9,14
chandler,I don't do that.,9,14
chandler,"I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?",9,14
monica,Yeah.,9,14
chandler,Today is the sixth.,9,14
monica,"No, it's not.",9,14
chandler,"Yes, it's also 2003.",9,14
monica,Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have       also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.,9,14
chandler,It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.,9,14
monica,Okay.,9,14
chandler,Tough crib.,9,14
monica,"Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.",9,14
chandler,I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.,9,14
monica,Chandler!,9,14
chandler,I am not working. There's not much to do around here!,9,14
ross,"Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height,       dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?",9,14
waiter,"Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.",9,14
ross,"Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.",9,14
waiter,Can I get you another glass of wine?,9,14
ross,"Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't want to be drunk when I go home       alone.",9,14
waiter,"Got stood up, huh?",9,14
ross,"Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.",9,14
waiter,"Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?",9,14
ross,No!,9,14
monica,We're okay. I'm still ovulating.,9,14
chandler,"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.",9,14
monica,"So, let's do this.",9,14
chandler,I - I don't think I can.,9,14
monica,"Come on. I know you are not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.",9,14
chandler,Because of Emma.,9,14
monica,"Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you are       right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.",9,14
chandler,Sorry.,9,14
monica,"Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware       of at this age?",9,14
chandler,"Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start...       canoodling in it.",9,14
monica,Canoodling?,9,14
chandler,"Well, I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front       of the B-A-B-Y.",9,14
monica,"I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't       so...",9,14
chandler,Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?,9,14
monica,I guess you are right.,9,14
chandler,"You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you       wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through       the window.",9,14
monica,But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?,9,14
rachel,"Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm going to have the chicken.",9,14
steve,I - I just have to say this; you are really beautiful.,9,14
rachel,"Oh, well, that is - that is very sweet. Thank you.",9,14
steve,I'm kind of funny looking.,9,14
rachel,What?,9,14
steve,"Oh, come on, you are way out of my league. Everybody in here knows       it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, ""ooh, why she out with       him? He must be rich!"" Well, I'm not!",9,14
rachel,"So, what do think you want to order? I'm really       excited about that chicken.",9,14
steve,"I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, ""well, he's       not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs""... That isn't       going to happen.",9,14
rachel,"Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now       wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant.       that is impressive.",9,14
steve,I lost it. To drugs.,9,14
steve,I silk-screen t-shirts now.,9,14
rachel,Really? What's that like?,9,14
steve,"It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. that is       right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with       two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.",9,14
rachel,"Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something       that you like about yourself.",9,14
steve,I do like my hair.,9,14
rachel,Really?,9,14
phoebe,Hello?,9,14
rachel,"Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!",9,14
phoebe,"Hey, Rach!",9,14
rachel,This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?,9,14
phoebe,"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.",9,14
rachel,I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!,9,14
phoebe,"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.",9,14
rachel,He's not stoned.,9,14
phoebe,Did he go out for a cigarette?,9,14
rachel,"Yeah, four times.",9,14
phoebe,"My dear, sweet Rach.",9,14
phoebe,"Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable       time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.",9,14
joey,"Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.",9,14
phoebe,"By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny       Mexico.  Oh, wait, that is the end of a different plan.",9,14
monica,She's asleep. Chandler?,9,14
monica,What are you doing?,9,14
chandler,Emma was doing it!,9,14
monica,She's asleep.,9,14
chandler,"Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...",9,14
monica,"Yes, but we have to be fast.",9,14
chandler,"Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.",9,14
monica,"Okay, I'll try.",9,14
joey,Hello?,9,14
joey,Emma? Hey! Hi!,9,14
joey,"How are you? How are you? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the       bedroom door closed?",9,14
joey,"You can't have S-E-X, when you are taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!",9,14
waiter,I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.,9,14
ross,"Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.",9,14
waiter,"Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're going to show you a good time.       Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on       the house.",9,14
ross,"Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that is nice. Although I was hoping to       have sex tonight.",9,14
waiter,Ooh...,9,14
ross,Just the crab cakes.,9,14
waiter #2,What are you       doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that.,9,14
waiter,"Just get out of here, okay?",9,14
ross,What's - what's going on?,9,14
waiter,"Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on       how long it'll take before you give up and go home.",9,14
ross,What? You - you are making money off my misery?,9,14
waiter,"Well, if you stay till 9",9,14
ross,"This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life.       Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.",9,14
monica,"Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.",9,14
chandler,I think we may have really done it this time.,9,14
monica,"Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.",9,14
chandler,You may want to get some more of those too.,9,14
chandler,Where's Emma?,9,14
monica,"Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?",9,14
chandler,"Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!",9,14
monica,"Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.       You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.",9,14
chandler,Okay.,9,14
monica,"Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another,       we're giving a baby back to Rachel.",9,14
steve,I - I can't believe I'm crying in front of you. You must       think I'm so pathetic.,9,14
rachel,"No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.",9,14
steve,Really?,9,14
rachel,Don't touch my coat!,9,14
rachel,"Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?",9,14
monica,"Hey, Rach, how's it going?",9,14
rachel,"Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!",9,14
rachel,"Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think       that this was going well?  What's up?",9,14
monica,"Hey, did you stop by here?",9,14
rachel,No.,9,14
monica,"Oh my god, then...",9,14
monica,"Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!",9,14
rachel,"What? What do you mean, ""there you are""? Where was she?",9,14
monica,"Oh, we were playing ""peek-a-boo."" She just“ she loves  it when I'm dramatic.",9,14
monica,Why the hell did you take her?,9,14
joey,Because you two were having sex!,9,14
monica,"No, we weren't!",9,14
joey,Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair.        You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?,9,14
chandler,"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's       ovulating.",9,14
joey,Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in       the next room. I'm going to have to tell Rachel about this.,9,14
chandler,"No, no, no.",9,14
monica,"No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!",9,14
joey,"Hey, I got to! Unless...",9,14
monica,Unless what?,9,14
joey,Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.,9,14
chandler,What? Why?,9,14
joey,"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's got to carry on my family       name.",9,14
chandler,Your family name is Tribbiani.,9,14
joey,You almost had me.,9,14
rachel,"Well, uh...",9,14
steve,"Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you       like to make love to me?",9,14
rachel,"Really, really not.",9,14
steve,"Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway.",9,14
rachel,"All right, well that is good to know. Good night, Steve.",9,14
ross,"Hey, what's wrong?",9,14
rachel,I just had a rough night.,9,14
ross,Oh. Crab cake?,9,14
rachel,Eww!,9,14
ross,"Well, what happened?",9,14
rachel,"Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...",9,14
ross,Monica told me you had a blind date.,9,14
rachel,Yeah.,9,14
ross,"I did, too.",9,14
rachel,Oh.,9,14
ross,But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?,9,14
rachel,"Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?",9,14
ross,Why does everyone keep saying that?,9,14
rachel,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown       up.",9,14
ross,That bad?,9,14
rachel,"Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be       appropriate to give me this.",9,14
ross,Female body inspector? What size is that?,9,14
phoebe,"Now, wait a minute. So, they're going to name their first child Joey?",9,14
joey,Uh-huh.,9,14
phoebe,How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?,9,14
joey,"It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.",9,14
phoebe,"Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.",9,14
phoebe,"Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.",9,14
phoebe,"Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.",9,14
ross,"The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.",9,14
rachel,"Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would       set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you       up on a date that didn't even show.",9,14
ross,"Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that is       just stupid.",9,14
joey,"We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really       bonding.",9,14
phoebe,"Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.",9,14
phoebe,"Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out.       They're coming this way. Run!",9,14
joey,Where?,9,14
phoebe,Mexico!,9,14
joey,Can you believe they're still not here?,9,14
ross,"I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the       chances?",9,14
joey,"I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?",9,14
waiter,What?,9,14
joey,We've been stood up.  And we want our free crab cakes.,9,14
waiter,"Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we       do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.",9,14
steve,I have such fat hands!,9,14
chandler,"Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what-",9,15
joey,"Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!",9,15
monica,Really?  Let's get past the moment.,9,15
phoebe,What's your news?,9,15
chandler,Thank you. I got a job in advertising.,9,15
monica,"Oh, honey, that is incredible!",9,15
phoebe,"Gosh, what's the pay like?  Oh, come on people-  come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most!  Hey Joey!",9,15
chandler,"Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.",9,15
joey,"Oh, that is cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.",9,15
chandler,"Right. So, it'll be the same except- less sex with you.",9,15
ross,"So, uh, what kind of stuff do you think they'll have you do there?",9,15
chandler,"Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.",9,15
phoebe,that is great.,9,15
chandler,"Yeah, I mean, there's probably going to be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating",9,15
chandler,Humiliating and noble!,9,15
ross,"You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.",9,15
monica,"Ross, you did not come up with ""got milk?""",9,15
ross,"Yes, I did, I did!  I should have written it down!",9,15
joey,Hey!,9,15
monica,Hey!,9,15
joey,Where's Chandler? I want to wish him good luck on his first day.  ... and I smelled bacon.,9,15
monica,He just left.,9,15
joey,Who did?,9,15
rachel,Joey! You never going to believe it,9,15
joey,She did?,9,15
rachel,You got it!,9,15
joey,I did?,9,15
monica,What is she talking about?,9,15
joey,"I don't know, but it sounds great.",9,15
rachel,Your agent called. You got that audition.,9,15
joey,With Lennart Haze?,9,15
rachel,Yes.,9,15
joey,"Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on Broadway- and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.",9,15
monica,Is it a good play?,9,15
joey,"Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word.",9,15
rachel,"Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it-",9,15
joey,"Yeah, yeah, and directing.",9,15
monica,He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.,9,15
rachel,You saw that?,9,15
monica,"No, but- I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.",9,15
rachel and joey,Ah!,9,15
joey,"Yeah, he's done some amazing works.",9,15
rachel,"Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.",9,15
joey,I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone.,9,15
monica,Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!,9,15
joey,Don't make me more nervous than I already am!,9,15
chandler,"Good morning, everybody.",9,15
intern,"Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?",9,15
chandler,"Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys- except for the tie, the briefcase- and the fact that I can rent a car.",9,15
intern,"Seriously, you are an intern?",9,15
chandler,"Yeah, well, I'm kind of heading into a new career direction and, you know, you got to start at the bottom.",9,15
intern,Dude!,9,15
chandler,"Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope",9,15
chandler,The comedian? USO?!,9,15
intern,"Uhm, it's USA, sir.",9,15
receptionist,"This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.",9,15
joey,It is so amazing to meet you.  I'm such a big fan of your work.,9,15
lennart,"Well, I've- I've been blessed with a- a lot of great roles.",9,15
joey,"Tell me about it! ""Unlimited nights and weekends!""",9,15
lennart,"You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out.  I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.",9,15
joey,"No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials.",9,15
lennart,Really?,9,15
joey,Yeah.,9,15
lennart,"Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.",9,15
joey,Are you kidding'? When they shoot you out of that cannon-,9,15
lennart,"Peeeeeooooooooch  ""Hang up that phone!"" One take!",9,15
joey,Wow!,9,15
lennart,"So, shall we read?",9,15
joey,"Oh, yah, sure.",9,15
lennart,Top of act two. This is my entrance. You got it?,9,15
lennart,"""What the hell are you still doing here""?",9,15
joey,"Err, ""I think you know"".",9,15
lennart,"""Bastard""!",9,15
joey,"""I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now.""",9,15
lennart,"""Go, go!""",9,15
joey,"""I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't.""",9,15
lennart,"I'm sorry, sorry. you are not supposed to say ""long pause""",9,15
joey,"Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a-",9,15
lennart,"No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank you.",9,15
joey,"Ah, y-y-you are sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern  ""I could go right now, man!""",9,15
lennart,My god in heaven.,9,15
producer #1,"Joey, hang on for a second. Lennart, can we talk to you for a moment?",9,15
lennart,"You, you got to be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act. .",9,15
lennart,"Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time.  This is a play. No, listen",9,15
joey,"Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also",9,15
lennart,"Well, if you want to come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready?",9,15
joey,Yeah.,9,15
lennart,"Uhm, you are in your head. You-you are thinking way too much.",9,15
joey,I really doubt that.,9,15
lennart,"No, no, no. It's that you are not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you.",9,15
joey,Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?,9,15
phoebe,"Hey, do you want to go to dinner tonight?",9,15
ross,"Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.",9,15
phoebe,"Oh, I hear divorce bells.",9,15
mugger,Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.,9,15
ross,What?,9,15
mugger,I have a gun,9,15
ross,"O-ok. Just relax, Phoebe, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.",9,15
mugger,"Alright, lady, now give me your purse!",9,15
phoebe,No.,9,15
ross,"What do you mean ""no""? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.",9,15
phoebe,"Lowell, is that you?",9,15
lowell,Phoebe?  Oh my god!,9,15
phoebe,Oh my god!,9,15
phoebe,"I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.",9,15
lowell,"Ross, nice to meet you.",9,15
ross,"Yeah, a real pleasure.",9,15
phoebe,"Ah, it's been so long, so long.  I can't believe you are still doing this!",9,15
lowell,"Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!",9,15
phoebe,Good for you!,9,15
lowell,So you look like you are doing really well! I guess you are mugging days are behind you?,9,15
phoebe,Ouh-,9,15
ross,"Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?",9,15
phoebe,"Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up-",9,15
monica,"Hey, how did the audition go?",9,15
joey,"Well, they want to see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.",9,15
monica,What happened?,9,15
joey,"Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.",9,15
monica,So far so good!,9,15
chandler,"Honey, I'm old!",9,15
monica,What's wrong?,9,15
chandler,I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.,9,15
monica,So you are a little older. Try to look at the positive,9,15
chandler,"Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.",9,15
joey,Wow  It's like they're on fire!,9,15
monica,What are they?,9,15
chandler,They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.,9,15
joey,I give you $ 500 for them!,9,15
chandler,What am I supposed to do with these?,9,15
monica,"Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.",9,15
chandler,"Well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore. Apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and I think I heard somebody say ""slorps"".  And here, look",9,15
monica,"Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?",9,15
chandler,"No, I don't think that is the kind of thing they're looking for.",9,15
joey,"Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?",9,15
all,"Hey, hey!",9,15
ross,"Hey, you'll never guess what just happened- Phoebe and I got mugged!",9,15
monica,You okay?!,9,15
ross,"Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!",9,15
monica,How do you know a mugger?,9,15
phoebe,I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.,9,15
ross,You want to know how she knew him?  Because Phoebe used to mug people.,9,15
monica,Seriously?,9,15
phoebe,"Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know- sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I-",9,15
monica,"Phoebe, that is awful!",9,15
phoebe,"Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony- I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer-",9,15
monica,you are mother killed herself!,9,15
phoebe,She was a drug dealer!,9,15
ross,"Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because  I was about to do some serious damage!",9,15
phoebe,Okay-,9,15
monica,"Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.",9,15
phoebe,Why?,9,15
monica,"Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.",9,15
phoebe,You were?,9,15
ross,"Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics- you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kind of trouble spiderman got into that week-",9,15
monica,Wonderwoman!,9,15
ross,"Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone-  - when out of nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says",9,15
phoebe,Oh my god-,9,15
ross,I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book,9,15
monica,Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?,9,15
ross,A superhuman thirst for knowledge.,9,15
monica,that is it.,9,15
ross,"Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?",9,15
phoebe,"No- actually, you might want to stay away from Jane street- that is where stabby Joe works.",9,15
phoebe,"Okay, I think we have a problem here.",9,15
monica,What?,9,15
phoebe,"Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.",9,15
monica,Yeah?,9,15
phoebe,"Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.",9,15
monica,So?,9,15
phoebe,"Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-",9,15
monica,"""Geology rocks!""",9,15
monica,Oh my god!,9,15
phoebe,I know- I mugged Ross!,9,15
receptionist,you are late!,9,15
joey,"I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?",9,15
receptionist,"No, Lennart doesn't wait!",9,15
joey,But I'm bursting with u-hu!,9,15
lennart,Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!,9,15
joey,"Actually, I really need-",9,15
lennart,"We must go now, quickly, please.",9,15
joey,Yes- ahahaaa,9,15
lennart,"Ready? ""What the hell are you still doing here?""",9,15
joey,"""I think you know!""",9,15
lennart,"""Oh, you sick bastard!""",9,15
joey,"""I am what you made me! You know what?""",9,15
lennart,"""What?""",9,15
joey,"""I could go right now.""",9,15
lennart,"""Then go, go!""",9,15
joey,"""I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!""",9,15
lennart,Cut! That was good.  That was very good. You did everything I asked for.,9,15
joey,I did?,9,15
lennart,"Yes. Plus- what you've got that- I don't know what you've got going- this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we going to do",9,15
joey,"Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really got to go.",9,15
lennart,Look at that,9,15
monica,Hey!,9,15
chandler,Hey!,9,15
monica,What are you doing?,9,15
chandler,"Putting on the sneakers- thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything-",9,15
rachel,"Oh, anything yet?",9,15
chandler,"Yes, how's this",9,15
joey,Hey!,9,15
all,Hey!,9,15
joey,Probably want to know what I'm doing-?,9,15
monica,"No, that seems about right.",9,15
joey,"Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!",9,15
rachel,"Joey, that was formula.",9,15
joey,We got to get more of that.,9,15
chandler,You know what- these aren't half-bad!  You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.,9,15
rachel,"Okay, first of all, that is stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.",9,15
chandler,Alright  I feel younger already!,9,15
chandler,"Yah, I think I broke my hip.",9,15
phoebe,"Hey, you!",9,15
ross,Hey!,9,15
phoebe,"Hey, how was class?",9,15
ross,"No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?",9,15
phoebe,"Nothing, I really want to know.",9,15
ross,"Oh-  Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene-",9,15
phoebe,"Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make- uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid-",9,15
ross,Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.,9,15
phoebe,"You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.",9,15
ross,"No, it wasn't.",9,15
phoebe,"Yes, it was.",9,15
ross,"No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old-",9,15
phoebe,"""give me your money, punk!""",9,15
ross,"Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you- you mugged me?",9,15
phoebe,"Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kind of neat.  I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kind of like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have- have a great one!",9,15
ross,It's not the best!,9,15
phoebe,"I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say-",9,15
ross,There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.,9,15
phoebe,Really? Even more humiliating than-,9,15
ross,"Hey, let's not do this!",9,15
intern,"- and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other!",9,15
boss,that is interesting! Just one thought,9,15
chandler,Okay-  You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age-,9,15
intern,Your age?,9,15
chandler,"A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know- maybe he falls- maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads",9,15
boss,"Chandler, that is great!",9,15
chandler,"Oh, thank you, sir- or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me",9,15
boss,"You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's-.  You did you come up with that?",9,15
chandler,"I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.",9,15
boss,That is great. Good work!,9,15
boss,See all of you tomorrow.,9,15
chandler,The cold weather hurts my hip!,9,15
phoebe,"Hey, Ross!  I know you are still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?",9,15
ross,"Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.",9,15
phoebe,I just really wanted to apologize again and- and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.,9,15
ross,"Oh my god, crap from the street?",9,15
phoebe,"Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell- or smoke.  Anyway, I was looking through it and I found ""Science Boy""",9,15
ross,Oh my god.  I never thought I'd see this again.  It's all here. What made you save it all these years?,9,15
phoebe,"I can't say, I just thought it was really good- and- maybe would be worth something some day.",9,15
ross,"You really thought ""Science Boy"" was worth saving!",9,15
phoebe,"Yeah- but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.",9,15
ross,"Still- this is amazing- Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.",9,15
phoebe,"you are welcome. And thank you for ""Science Boy"". I learned a lot from him",9,15
ross,you are welcome.,9,15
joey,"""I need an answer!""",9,15
lennart,"""I-I-I can't tell you something' I don't know.""",9,15
joey,"""You know!""",9,15
lennart,"""I don't know!""",9,15
joey,"""I need an answer now!""",9,15
lennart,"""Alright, here, you want an answer- the answer- is-""",9,15
joey,Oh!,9,15
lennart,"""She never loved me, she only loved you.""",9,15
joey,"""You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for - Bang - End Scene!""",9,15
lennart,Absolutely amazing!  The part is yours.,9,15
joey,"Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get-",9,15
lennart,Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it!  You can relax now. Yeah.,9,15
monica,"Wow, that is a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn- on a Saturday afternoon?!  I was in the house!",9,15
ross,"Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that-",9,15
monica,#NAME?,9,15
ross,I see. You didn't happen to tell-,9,15
monica,#NAME?,9,15
ross,Great. Thanks!,9,15
chandler,Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?,9,16
monica,I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since   I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all   our money?,9,16
chandler,"I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.",9,16
monica,"I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than   we're bringing in.",9,16
chandler,Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.,9,16
monica,"Oh, But you are finally doing something that you love! I can't ask   you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was you know...   finding gold.",9,16
chandler,You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal   out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next   month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's   refrigerator for a change. you are chef... what can you make out of backing   soda and beer?,9,16
monica,Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.,9,16
chandler,No! We're not borrowing money.,9,16
monica,Why not?,9,16
chandler,Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing   my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool   house... but the other thing was never borrow money.,9,16
monica,Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.,9,16
chandler,that is right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through   this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.,9,16
mike,I'm going to go.,9,16
phoebe,Why??,9,16
mike,I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more   clothes.,9,16
phoebe,"Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.",9,16
mike,I put that tube top on as a joke.,9,16
phoebe,I want you to stay.,9,16
mike,I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers   as I can..,9,16
phoebe,Why don't you turn them inside ou...,9,16
mike,Done it.  I'll be back in a couple   of hours.,9,16
phoebe,I'll miss you.,9,16
mike,Me too.  You know   what? I just realised something. I don't want to go home.,9,16
phoebe,Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.,9,16
mike,"No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and   partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm   there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?",9,16
phoebe,"Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say ""Hell   yeah!""",9,16
mike,So we're doing it?,9,16
phoebe,"Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together!  Oh god, we're really going to move in together!",9,16
mike,Yeah!,9,16
phoebe,"I've always wanted to live with a guy. ""Pick up your socks!"" ""Put   down the toilet seat!"" ""No! We're not having sex anymore!"" It's   going to be fun!",9,16
monica,Hey Joey!,9,16
joey,Hey!,9,16
monica,"Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never   get back to Chandler.",9,16
joey,"I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is   my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.",9,16
monica,Ok first of all...It would be great. But that is   not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.,9,16
joey,"Aww, I don't know Monica you know... erm... lending friends money is always   a mistake.",9,16
monica,But Chandler lent you money!,9,16
joey,And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.,9,16
monica,Come on...I just need it for some rent and.. and some other bills.,9,16
joey,Oh...how much?,9,16
monica,Two thousand dollars?,9,16
joey,Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?,9,16
monica,Yeah...,9,16
joey,that is right I am!,9,16
rachel,Hi you guys!,9,16
joey,Hey!,9,16
joey,Ou...what's in the bag?,9,16
rachel,"Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this   place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff   to baby-proof the apartment.",9,16
joey,"Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? You know, when   I was a kid it was like.. ""Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!"" or   er.. ""Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!"" Huh!",9,16
monica,"Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?",9,16
rachel,No. I was just going to do this myself.,9,16
joey,you are going to do it?,9,16
rachel,"Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?",9,16
joey,"Oh, women can. You can't.",9,16
rachel,Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?,9,16
monica,you are a pig. And you can't do this.,9,16
rachel,Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!,9,16
joey,The hardware store is right down the street.,9,16
rachel,There is a hardware store right down the street?,9,16
phoebe,"Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.",9,16
mike,Phoebe and I are moving in together.,9,16
"monica, chandler, ross",Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!,9,16
phoebe,I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.,9,16
monica,"Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal   your makeup. Unless they're playing ""This is what my sister would look   like""",9,16
chandler,Yeah.... she's not so cute.,9,16
mike,I'm going to go to the bathroom.,9,16
phoebe,"Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.",9,16
mike,Yes dear.,9,16
monica,Is that a bit you guys do?,9,16
phoebe,Uh huh...we're playing you two.,9,16
monica,We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!,9,16
chandler,Yes dear.,9,16
ross,"I can't believe you guys are moving in together. that is, that is great!   I mean...I'm happy for you guys..",9,16
monica,I hear wedding bells.,9,16
phoebe,"Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You   know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah.  you know. I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that   highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house   in Connecticut...you know. Near the good schools where Mike and I can send   Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.",9,16
ross,"Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.",9,16
phoebe,I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a   soccer mom!,9,16
mike,You ready to go?,9,16
phoebe,Yeah! You bet roomy!,9,16
monica,Don't you mean..groomy?,9,16
mike,What are you talking about?,9,16
phoebe,"Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have   us picking out china patterns.",9,16
phoebe,China patterns!!!!!,9,16
rachel,This is easy...Can't do this!  Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.,9,16
chandler,Hey Joe!,9,16
joey,Hey!,9,16
chandler,Listen er.. I need to ask you a favour but you can't tell Monica anything   about it.,9,16
joey,I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.,9,16
chandler,And that would have made the official party line.  Monica   and I are having a little financial trouble.,9,16
joey,"Yeah, I know.",9,16
chandler,What? What do you mean you know?,9,16
joey,"Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you are not working and   the economy is bad.",9,16
chandler,Oh! Right.,9,16
joey,that is the fastest I have ever thought!,9,16
chandler,"Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.",9,16
joey,Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?,9,16
chandler,Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!,9,16
joey,Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your   rent is.,9,16
chandler,Oh ok.,9,16
joey,I am on fire!,9,16
chandler,Listen...this is really nice. Do you...    Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars?   Did Monica borrow money from you?,9,16
joey,Err... Kind of.,9,16
chandler,I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?,9,16
joey,"Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems,   it was for something for her.",9,16
chandler,What?,9,16
joey,Something personal.,9,16
chandler,What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she   wouldn't tell me about?,9,16
woman,Excuse me.,9,16
joey,Boob job.,9,16
monica,I don't want her to get a boob job! that is crazy!,9,16
joey,"Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would   be crazy.",9,16
mike,"Well hey, I want to ask you about Monica's little ""groomy"" joke.",9,16
phoebe,Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is because it's   a play on the word roomy.,9,16
mike,"I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I want to say is...   maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you are not   expecting a proposal, right?",9,16
phoebe,Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where   it goes.,9,16
mike,"Yeah well, that is the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.",9,16
phoebe,What do you mean?,9,16
mike,"Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married   again.",9,16
phoebe,Oh. Wow.,9,16
mike,"It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of   lost faith in the whole idea.",9,16
phoebe,Was it really that bad?,9,16
mike,At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....,9,16
phoebe,"Ok, well that is bad. But don't you think it might be different with   someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in   the ocean.",9,16
mike,Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time   I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!,9,16
phoebe,But it's just...,9,16
mike,"Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never want to get married again.",9,16
phoebe,Oh!,9,16
mike,I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together   isn't the best idea.,9,16
phoebe,No! I definitely don't want to get married. No I just wanted to make   sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start   changing your mind there's going to be hell to pay mister!,9,16
mike,"Trust me, I will never...",9,16
phoebe,Yeah I get that.,9,16
rachel,Hi!,9,16
monica,So you gave in and decided to call someone?,9,16
rachel,"Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.",9,16
handyman,you are all set.,9,16
rachel,Oh thank you so much.  Oh oh wait!   You forgot your erm...Your game.,9,16
handyman,Thanks.....,9,16
chandler,Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.,9,16
rachel,Don't look at me I never get his jokes.,9,16
monica,Thank you?,9,16
chandler,Oh no.. don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing   I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two...   single things.,9,16
monica,"Ok, you are being weird. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?",9,16
chandler,"No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.",9,16
monica,"Ok.. You know the old classics you know, You look nice? They're still   ok.",9,16
chandler,"Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice.   I want to compliment your body. I mean.. I wouldn't change it. At all. And more   specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.",9,16
monica,Okay...,9,16
chandler,"I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would   you? Don't answer that.",9,16
rachel,Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any weirder.,9,16
monica,I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?,9,16
rachel,"I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?",9,16
monica,Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting   to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.,9,16
rachel,No you really think that is what it is?,9,16
monica,"You heard him! ""No bigger!"" ""you are perfect!"" ""Just   don't get any bigger!"" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling   coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.",9,16
rachel,"Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's going to change. Your   breasts are going to get bigger, your ass is going to get bigger, you are going to lose   bladder control.  God! It's just such a magical time!",9,16
phoebe,Hi,9,16
ross,Hey!,9,16
phoebe,"Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.",9,16
ross,Oh great now you are seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for   all hanging out but to come to my home!,9,16
phoebe,No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.,9,16
ross,Why?,9,16
phoebe,Mike doesn't ever want to get married.,9,16
ross,Never?,9,16
phoebe,Never.,9,16
ross,"wow, are you still going to move in with him?",9,16
phoebe,"I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really   that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything.   That marriage stinks!",9,16
ross,"Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you want to see a man gain weight   and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.",9,16
phoebe,that is not how you really feel is it?,9,16
ross,"No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that is what you want to hear right now   but I can't help it. I love marriage.",9,16
phoebe,Seriously? You divorce-o?,9,16
ross,"If you have to call me name, I prefer ""Ross the Divorcer"".   It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love   to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before   she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.",9,16
phoebe,It's ok that is how you feel.,9,16
ross,But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have   so much fun and you love Mike.,9,16
phoebe,I do love Mike.,9,16
ross,"Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and   you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!",9,16
phoebe,Yeah I guess you are right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.,9,16
ross,"The Divorcer, to the rescue!",9,16
phoebe,It's not cooler.,9,16
ross,Yeah I just hurt it.,9,16
joey,Rach?!  Rachel!!!!?  So I can't do anything I like????,9,16
chandler,Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection.  Wouldn't change   a thing. Not a thing.,9,16
monica,Honey?,9,16
chandler,Yeah?,9,16
monica,About that? Erm...I'm going to change.,9,16
chandler,But honey you don't have to.,9,16
monica,I'm going to get bigger!,9,16
chandler,Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!,9,16
rachel,Argh. fascist,9,16
monica,"Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not!   And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger   too.",9,16
chandler,your ass?!?!?,9,16
rachel,"Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!",9,16
chandler,They...do that?,9,16
monica,It's kind of a package deal!,9,16
chandler,God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?,9,16
monica,I thought I was something that we both wanted!,9,16
chandler,"Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get   on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?",9,16
rachel,"Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to   be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present   that is shooting out of her!?",9,16
chandler,What?,9,16
rachel,Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?,9,16
joey,Because she is!,9,16
monica,"Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.",9,16
joey,Mmm hmm! For your boob job!,9,16
"monica, rachel, chandler",It's over/Joe!,9,16
joey,OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any   bigger?,9,16
ross,"Hey! What do you guys think about this. ""Ross",9,16
phoebe,Better.,9,16
mike,Very cool.,9,16
ross,"Hey Pheebs, you know I'm I'm really glad you came to talk to me the   other day and I hope I was a little helpful.",9,16
phoebe,"Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.",9,16
ross,"Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised   I don't think marriage is necessarily the right path for you.",9,16
phoebe,What do you mean?,9,16
ross,"Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in   the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly   picture yourself in a Volvo?",9,16
phoebe,They are awfully boxy...,9,16
ross,I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.,9,16
phoebe,Uh huh.,9,16
ross,"Hey hey, can I help?",9,16
chandler,"Well! We er.. climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow   hallway, dodged a rabid Pitbull... but these last three feet are where it gets   really tricky.",9,16
ross,You know sometimes your words... they hurt.,9,16
joey,"Hey uh, where do you guys want this?",9,16
rachel,"Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy.  I   mean not for me because I'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.",9,16
phoebe,Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle   room? None at all?,9,16
mike,No but... You don't want to get married either right?,9,16
phoebe,Right. Except that I do want to get married.,9,16
joey,Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?,9,16
mike,You want to get married?,9,16
phoebe,Someday.,9,16
chandler,And....... hernia.,9,16
phoebe,I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was   missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the   regular stuff.,9,16
mike,But if you want to get married why didn't you say something before?,9,16
phoebe,"Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and   I wanted to live with you.",9,16
mike,I want to live with you too! Let's do that!,9,16
phoebe,"But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what   was going to happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever going to happen.",9,16
mike,Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind   about marriage.,9,16
phoebe,Are you going to change yours?,9,16
mike,No.,9,16
phoebe,Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.,9,16
mike,But I don't want this to end.,9,16
phoebe,I don't want it to end either.,9,16
mike,I can't believe this is going to end. I guess I'll have my stuff packed   up.,9,16
phoebe,Yeah.,9,16
mike,Ok... so... Goodbye.,9,16
chandler/joey/rachel/monica,Bye bye Mike!,9,16
rachel,I'm so sorry Pheebs.,9,16
monica,We're all sorry...,9,16
chandler,"Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with   this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.",9,16
joey,AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright...  Better take all I can carry. Who knows when I'll be able   to get in here again!,9,16
chandler,Hey! Ready to go?,9,17
ross,"Oh yeah, let me just finish this.",9,17
joey,"Hey Ross, check this out!  yeah, I can't do that!",9,17
chandler,What are you doin'?,9,17
ross,"Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you are up to.",9,17
chandler,"Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .",9,17
ross,It's actually kind of interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?,9,17
chandler,The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?,9,17
ross,"Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...",9,17
chandler,Bet she'd sleep with you now...,9,17
ross,No... I already e-mailed her.,9,17
chandler,Let me see what you wrote about yourself,9,17
ross,"You know what? I'm going to finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.",9,17
joey,Hey!,9,17
ross,What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??,9,17
chandler,"Maybe we finish this for him!  ""Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had""... and SEND!",9,17
joey,"No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!",9,17
ross,"Alright, let's go!",9,17
joey,Dude!,9,17
ross,I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!,9,17
joey,and SEND!,9,17
rachel,Hey! How was basketball?,9,17
joey,"Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!",9,17
rachel,"Oh, no! Who did that?",9,17
joey,Chandler... hey...  Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?,9,17
rachel,"She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. that is all right? Isn't it?",9,17
joey,"Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!",9,17
rachel,"Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!",9,17
joey,"Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...",9,17
rachel,"All right... Oh, Emma loves him!",9,17
joey,Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!,9,17
phoebe,Hi.,9,17
monica,Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feeling' better?,9,17
phoebe,"Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!",9,17
chandler,"Oh, I'm so sorry!",9,17
phoebe,"Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!!  Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...",9,17
chandler,you are not going to need my help?,9,17
phoebe,"Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm going to come to you.",9,17
chandler,"Oh good, Because I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth",9,17
phoebe,"Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm going to miss him so much. I'm going to want to see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.",9,17
monica,"Ok, you got it!",9,17
phoebe,"Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.",9,17
monica,Really? If that is what you want...,9,17
phoebe,That was a test and you just failed.,9,17
monica,Damn it! Rookie mistake!,9,17
ross,I have sex with dinosaurs??,9,17
chandler,I believe I read that somewhere!,9,17
ross,"That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...   It's not funny!!",9,17
chandler,I respectfully disagree.,9,17
ross,I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!,9,17
chandler,Who cares? Nobody reads those things,9,17
ross,You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.,9,17
chandler,I don't have a page.,9,17
ross,Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!,9,17
joey,"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...  with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around you.  It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep.",9,17
rachel,,9,17
joey,"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",9,17
rachel,What are you doing?,9,17
joey,"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.",9,17
rachel,"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.",9,17
joey,There you go sweetie...   This isn't over.,9,17
monica,"Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...   ""gay as the day is long""?",9,17
chandler,Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.,9,17
monica,But that is clearly a joke. This could easily be true.,9,17
chandler,Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.,9,17
monica,"Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.",9,17
chandler,"Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie!  I'm so going to get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .",9,17
monica,What are you doing?,9,17
chandler,"Oh, you'll see my friend.",9,17
ross,I'm dead?,9,17
chandler,And so young.,9,17
ross,Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.,9,17
chandler,"Well, how you died was funny.",9,17
ross,"Oh please, hit by a blimp?",9,17
chandler,It kills over one americans every year.,9,17
ross,"Unbelievable, my classmates are going to think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are going to get phone calls. you are messing with people's feelings here.",9,17
chandler,You want to talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!,9,17
ross,"You've really crossed the line here, but that is okay, it's ok Because I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. that is right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.",9,17
phoebe,"God, I wish Mike were here.",9,17
monica,Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?,9,17
monica,"What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!",9,17
phoebe,"I got to call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.",9,17
monica,"Phoebe, that is how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you are 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you are going to want to see him. And if you see him, you are going to want to get back together with him. I know that is not what you want.  Give me your phone.",9,17
phoebe,Here.,9,17
monica,And now your cell.,9,17
phoebe,Okay,9,17
monica,This is your cell phone?,9,17
phoebe,Yes.,9,17
monica,This is your current cell phone?,9,17
phoebe,"Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.",9,17
monica,"Phoebe, where's your purse?",9,17
monica,"No, no! Give it to me!",9,17
phoebe,You can't have it.,9,17
monica,Give it to me!,9,17
phoebe,No,9,17
monica,I'll go in there.,9,17
phoebe,Oh yeah.,9,17
monica,Phoebe come here,9,17
monica,Haha!,9,17
phoebe,Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!,9,17
joey,"Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.",9,17
rachel,"Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.",9,17
joey,"No, no, it's not a girl, it's...  a brand new Hugsy!",9,17
rachel,"Oh that is so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.",9,17
joey,"No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.",9,17
rachel,"Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...",9,17
joey,Make the transfer!,9,17
rachel,Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?,9,17
joey,"Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.",9,17
rachel,"Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.",9,17
joey,But he's the same.,9,17
rachel,"Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.",9,17
joey,But he's the same.,9,17
rachel,"Joey, come on!",9,17
joey,He's the same!,9,17
joey,you are not the same!,9,17
monica,Haha!,9,17
phoebe,"You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.",9,17
monica,"So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.",9,17
phoebe,Those are my shoes.,9,17
monica,"Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.",9,17
phoebe,"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kind of want to be alone right now.",9,17
monica,Who's that?,9,17
phoebe,I ordered Chinese food.,9,17
phoebe,What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?,9,17
monica,What are you doing here?,9,17
mike,Phoebe called me.,9,17
monica,Phoebe!,9,17
phoebe,"I'm sorry, I broke down...  I wanted to see him.",9,17
monica,Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?,9,17
phoebe,There is a speakerphone on the base unit...,9,17
monica,Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!,9,17
mike,"Look, if I want to see Phoebe and she wants to see...",9,17
monica,This doesn't concern you!!,9,17
mike,"Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!",9,17
monica,"Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.",9,17
phoebe,Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?,9,17
monica,"Sure! If you are just going to hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join you. You know, I'm your friend  and Mike's friend .",9,17
phoebe,Sit down.,9,17
monica,Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!,9,17
mike,So how've you been?,9,17
monica,I've been pretty good!,9,17
mike,You look really beautiful.,9,17
phoebe,"Thanks, you look good too.",9,17
monica,Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!,9,17
phoebe,So how's the piano playing going?,9,17
mike,Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.,9,17
phoebe,I've missed you too.,9,17
monica,"You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!",9,17
chandler,"Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?",9,17
ross,"uhu uhu, check this out.",9,17
chandler,Huh! So that is what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. you are not actually going to send these out are you?,9,17
ross,"Eh.. actually no, I don't need to because your little ""Ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?",9,17
chandler,"No, come on, you know that is not true.",9,17
ross,What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!,9,17
chandler,"Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.",9,17
ross,I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!,9,17
chandler,"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are going to stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are going to post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you are dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.",9,17
ross,you are right. There isn't a decent outlet.,9,17
chandler,"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.",9,17
ross,Exactly!!,9,17
chandler,"Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? you are having a memorial service for yourself!?",9,17
ross,No! That would be stupid! you are having it for me!,9,17
chandler,"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !",9,17
ross,"oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...",9,17
rachel,"I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?",9,17
joey,Original or crappy?,9,17
rachel,Original.,9,17
joey,"No, sorry haven't seen him.",9,17
rachel,Then what's that big lump under your covers?,9,17
joey,"It's Monica, ok?",9,17
rachel,that is not Monica!,9,17
joey,"Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..",9,17
rachel,Oh God.,9,17
joey,... she's being unreasonable!,9,17
rachel,"Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much  Oh don't cover its ears!  It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!",9,17
joey,It does?,9,17
rachel,Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.,9,17
joey,Really? She... she loves me?,9,17
rachel,"Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .",9,17
joey,"Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then...  well she can have him.",9,17
rachel,"Ooh... you are sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up.  Look Emma, look who's back!",9,17
joey,Look forget it forget it...  I can't do it.,9,17
rachel,Are you going to...  you are going to take Hugsy away from a little child?,9,17
joey,How do you think I got him in the first place?,9,17
monica,"Alright you two, I'm going to go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss",9,17
mike,"I've missed you so much! No, I'm not going to ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.",9,17
phoebe,"I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?",9,17
mike,"It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time...  I never would have stopped.",9,17
monica,"Kiss him, you fool!!",9,17
phoebe,What?,9,17
monica,Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!,9,17
phoebe,"Oh, I missed you so much!",9,17
strange man,I knew you'd be here!,9,17
mike,"Oh, crap!",9,17
phoebe,Who is this?,9,17
mike,My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.,9,17
monica,"Hi, that is what I'm doing for Phoebe!",9,17
manny,"Well, you are not doing a very good job!",9,17
monica,Excuse me?,9,17
manny,What's with the kissing?,9,17
monica,"Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.",9,17
manny,"Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!",9,17
monica,You didn't hear the speech!,9,17
manny,I've heard the speech,9,17
monica,"Hey, it was very moving! you are just heartless!",9,17
manny,you are weak!,9,17
monica,you are... weird!,9,17
manny,Your pants are undone!,9,17
monica,Oh !,9,17
manny,Where did they go?,9,17
monica,Damn it!,9,17
manny,Oh we blew it. I blame myself.,9,17
monica,And I blame you too.,9,17
ross,"It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are going to get seriously haunted!",9,17
chandler,There you go! Someone came!,9,17
ross,"Ok, ok! I'm going to go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!",9,17
monica,"Hi, glad you could come.",9,17
chandler,"Please, come in.",9,17
tom,"Hi, you are Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.",9,17
chandler,"Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.",9,17
tom,"Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...",9,17
chandler,At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps,9,17
ross,Who is he?,9,17
chandler,"Some guy, Tom Gordon.",9,17
ross,"I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.",9,17
monica,"So, did you know Ross well?",9,17
tom,"Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?",9,17
monica,"Yes, he is. Me.",9,17
tom,What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?,9,17
chandler,"Ok Tommy, that is enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!",9,17
tom,"Hey, listen. Call me.",9,17
chandler,Ok!,9,17
ross,I'm dead and no one cares?,9,17
monica,I look like a man??,9,17
chandler,"Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!",9,17
ross,"It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!",9,17
chandler,"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!",9,17
ross,"Yes, you are right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?",9,17
chandler,"Oh, that is not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?",9,17
ross,Yeah...,9,17
chandler,"I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.",9,17
kori,Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.,9,17
chandler,Kori? Kori Weston?,9,17
kori,Yeah...,9,17
chandler,Wow! You look amazing!,9,17
kori,And you are...,9,17
chandler,"Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.",9,17
monica,You are married though.,9,17
chandler,"Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!",9,17
kori,I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.,9,17
chandler,I didn't know Ross and you were so close.,9,17
kori,We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.,9,17
chandler,"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.",9,17
kori,I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.,9,17
ross,"But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!",9,17
kori,"You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!",9,17
ross,Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!,9,17
ross,"No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok?  Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless.  Monica?",9,17
joey,"Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?",9,18
monica,Ok.,9,18
joey,Alright!,9,18
monica,But ehm...what is it not?,9,18
joey,A place to entertain my lady friends.,9,18
monica,And what else is it not?,9,18
joey,A place to eat spaghetti.,9,18
monica,Very good!  What do you need it for anyway?,9,18
joey,"Oh well, the powerball lottery is up to 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...",9,18
rachel,Oh! So you are driving up to Connecticut?,9,18
joey,Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.,9,18
monica,"Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!",9,18
joey,Uh!,9,18
monica,"Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.",9,18
chandler,"Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!",9,18
phoebe,Hey will you get me tickets too?,9,18
rachel,"Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!",9,18
everyone almost simultaneously except ross,yeah that's a great idea!,9,18
ross,No thanks!,9,18
phoebe,You don't want to win the lottery?,9,18
ross,"Uh...sure I do, and I also want to be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.",9,18
chandler,Still on Amelia Earhart?,9,18
ross,The woman just vanished!,9,18
joey,"Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?",9,18
ross,No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.,9,18
chandler,Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.,9,18
joey,I like those odds!,9,18
ross,"Seriously you guys, I can't believe you are going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that is such a bunch of boohaki.",9,18
chandler,I'll ask.  Boohaki?,9,18
ross,"Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.",9,18
rachel,"Yeah so get ready to hear a lot of ehm...boohaki, gosh darn it and brother pucker.",9,18
monica,How do you know she's going to start talking?,9,18
rachel,Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.,9,18
chandler,kind of like Joey.,9,18
joey,What's that now?,9,18
monica,God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.,9,18
chandler,Pie eating contest?,9,18
monica,Oh! You assume because I was heavy that is the only way I could win something?,9,18
chandler,"No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.",9,18
monica,That was a good day!,9,18
ross,"They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!",9,18
monica,I'm parked in a garage on Morton!,9,18
ross,They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.,9,18
joey,Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma!  Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?,9,18
rachel,Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!,9,18
joey,I was?,9,18
racel,Yes and you talked to her...,9,18
joey,I did?,9,18
rachel,She dropped off a casserole?,9,18
joey,Oh yeah! The casserole lady.,9,18
monica,"So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?",9,18
ross,"Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!",9,18
chandler,"Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!!",9,18
ross,Think he washed his hands?,9,18
chandler,"Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?",9,18
rachel,What's going on?,9,18
monica,"Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistant job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.",9,18
joey,Ooh! Tough odds!,9,18
ross,Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!,9,18
joey,Look who's coming around!,9,18
chandler,Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.,9,18
joey,Did you get it?,9,18
chandler,One of the slots got filled.,9,18
joey,By you!?,9,18
chandler,Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.,9,18
monica,Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!,9,18
chandler,Yeah I know.,9,18
rachel,"Well, there's two spots left right?",9,18
chandler,"Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I want to get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.",9,18
phoebe,"Hey you guys! Ok, you are not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely going to win the lottery tonight!",9,18
monica,"Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.",9,18
ross,A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!,9,18
monica,"Alright, who wants to do it?",9,18
phoebe,"Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!",9,18
monica,"Ok, hey Rach?",9,18
rachel,"Oh no, I'm good, I don't want to get that turkey smell all over my hands.",9,18
joey,I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.,9,18
phoebe,I hope I win!,9,18
monica,"Well, it doesn't really matter ... you are both wishing for the same thing, right?",9,18
joey,I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!,9,18
monica,"Right! .. but we ""know"" what you are wishing for!",9,18
joey,Can't really say!,9,18
monica,"I understand, but you are wishing for what we think you are wishing for, aren't you?",9,18
joey,I'm not really comfortable with these questions!,9,18
"rachel, chandler and monica","Please, just do it!",9,18
phoebe,"One, two, three!",9,18
joey,"I won, hey!",9,18
ross,"You know what, I'm sure your wish is going to come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!  Ah!! That thing gets hot!!",9,18
rachel,"You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you going to feel if we actually do win?",9,18
ross,"Uh, you are not going to win.",9,18
rachel,"Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you going to feel? You know, we're going to be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you are going to be all like ""oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I got to gas up the Hyundai""",9,18
ross,"Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.",9,18
chandler,I can see the headline now,9,18
ross,Why would I eat my own arm?,9,18
chandler,"Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.",9,18
monica,"You know what, Ross? I'm going to throw in 50 bucks for you.",9,18
ross,Why?,9,18
monica,"Because I know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and going to watch the numbers and have fun. And you are my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.",9,18
ross,"You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that is so sweet! Come here",9,18
phoebe,Get a room!,9,18
chandler,"Ok, so now that you are in, what are you going to do if we win?",9,18
ross,"I don't know, probably just invest it.",9,18
chandler,Ooh! Calm down ...,9,18
joey,"Seriously, that is your fantasy? To invest it?",9,18
ross,"Oh, I'm sorry, did I say ""invest it""? I meant ""be cool and piss it all away""",9,18
joey,"Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!",9,18
rachel,I don't really care about the Knicks.,9,18
joey,"Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.",9,18
rachel,You would do that? I never get picked!,9,18
chandler,"You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.",9,18
joey,you are not going to let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you are taking this away from me!,9,18
chandler,"you are right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.",9,18
ross,"Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?",9,18
chandler,I'll take this one too  Uh ... Mommy?,9,18
ross,"Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel ""Mommy"" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...",9,18
rachel,I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.,9,18
ross,"Although if we're going to do that, we should probably call me ""Daddy"" too.",9,18
phoebe,"Ooh, I like that, ""daddy""",9,18
ross,I ... I was just talking about Rachel.,9,18
phoebe,"Ooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy going to spank me?",9,18
ross,Well that depends ... have you been a bad gi ..  no I can't.,9,18
chandler,"Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye.",9,18
joey,"Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?",9,18
chandler,"Well no, Charlie's going to get that.",9,18
monica,"Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!",9,18
chandler,He's the boss's son.,9,18
monica,"Come on, lottery!!",9,18
rachel,"Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.",9,18
monica,"Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?  Ok, how about this",9,18
rachel,"Ooh, I have another idea!",9,18
monica,"I'm sorry, idea time is over.",9,18
phoebe,"Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?",9,18
monica,Yeah.,9,18
chandler,What about the ones you have on the nightstand?,9,18
monica,There are no tickets on the nightstand!,9,18
chandler,"Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.",9,18
monica,"Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!",9,18
chandler,"Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!",9,18
monica,"Chandler, sense the tone!!",9,18
rachel,"Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!",9,18
monica,"Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.",9,18
phoebe,Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.,9,18
ross,"I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!",9,18
monica,"Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!",9,18
ross,3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that is important ...,9,18
joey,"I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?",9,18
monica,When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!,9,18
joey,I'll show you how.,9,18
rachel,"Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win? How are you going to feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?",9,18
monica,"Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not going to leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!",9,18
rachel,"Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?",9,18
chandler,"She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...",9,18
monica,Ah!,9,18
chandler,"Let me finish ...  however, it doesn't look like I'm going to get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!",9,18
monica,There's the man I married!!,9,18
rachel,"All right, believe me. If you win the lottery, it's the last you are going to hear from us!",9,18
monica,"Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!",9,18
rachel,"OH! Alright, you know what? that is it! I want my share of the tickets !",9,18
joey,"Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!",9,18
ross,"Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm going to put it all into a very low-yield bond.",9,18
phoebe,"Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together",9,18
monica,"No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!",9,18
joey,"Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!",9,18
chandler,"Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!",9,18
rachel,"Ok, that is it! Just give them to me! I'll split them up!",9,18
joey,Oh!,9,18
phoebe,Ooh!,9,18
ross,"Hey, hey!!",9,18
phoebe,"Ooh!  Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this!",9,18
rachel,"Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.",9,18
joey,"No, no!",9,18
phoebe,"If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! .",9,18
everyone,NO!!,9,18
phoebe,Don't come any closer!,9,18
chandler,"Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...",9,18
phoebe,"No, what's more important, your friends or money?",9,18
everyone but monica,Friends!,9,18
monica,Money!  Friends...,9,18
phoebe,"Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?",9,18
monica,They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...,9,18
ross,Monica!,9,18
phoebe,"Ok, good!  You guys were so scared! There was no way I was going to dump this... Oh God, no!  I think I broke your bowl.",9,18
ross,"Go, go, go!!",9,18
phoebe,"What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.",9,18
monica,"Phoebe, we lost half of them.",9,18
phoebe,"So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I  was going to win, remember?",9,18
ross,Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...,9,18
phoebe,"As a matter of fact she said that is how I am going to die.  So, excuse me for being a little skittish.",9,18
chandler,"Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!",9,18
monica,"Oh, play them!",9,18
chandler,"Ok, here we go!",9,18
message,"""Hello. Th-this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise""  ""I sh.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo.""",9,18
phoebe,"Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.",9,18
second message,"""Hey Chandler, it's Charlie""",9,18
chandler,This is.. shhh!,9,18
second message,"""Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot. I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a call if you want.""",9,18
monica,"Oh God, I am so sorry honey...",9,18
all,"Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!",9,18
rachel,"Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.",9,18
chandler,"Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?",9,18
rachel,"No, she was just much better at job than me!",9,18
phoebe,"Guys, the drawing is about to start!",9,18
rachel,You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.,9,18
ross,"Oh yeah, it's a good idea!",9,18
monica,"Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.",9,18
chandler,"Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.  But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?",9,18
monica,131!,9,18
ross,"Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you are daddy's little girl...  Phoebe's totally ruined that for me...",9,18
rachel,"Hi mum, put her back on!",9,18
joey,"Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.",9,18
tv,"""Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53""",9,18
chandler,I got that!,9,18
ross,"Oh, we have one too!!",9,18
monica,"We are on a roll, people!!",9,18
ross,Come on!!,9,18
rachel,"Mum, please! I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?",9,18
tv,"""And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7""",9,18
monica,Check your numbers! Make me rich!,9,18
rachel,"Guys, you are not going to believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!",9,18
all,Wow!,9,18
joey,And what did she say?,9,18
rachel,"She said ""gleba""!!",9,18
monica,Make me rich!!,9,18
rachel,Isn't that amazing?,9,18
ross,"Oh yeah, no no no...that is great!",9,18
rachel,Why-why aren't you more excited?,9,18
ross,"Oh, Rach...oh...""gleba"" is not a word.",9,18
rachel,"Oh, but of course it is!",9,18
ross,"Okay, what does it mean?",9,18
rachel,I don't know all the words.,9,18
ross,"I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words .",9,18
ross,"Yes you did, gleba is a word!",9,18
ross,"Ok, use it in a sentence.",9,18
rachel,"Ok... ""Emma just said gleba""!",9,18
ross,It's not a word!,9,18
rachel,"Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm going to look it up .",9,18
ross,"Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you are at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up",9,18
rachel,"Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba...  Gleba! Ha! Here it is",9,18
ross,She's going to be a scientist!,9,18
joey,Damnit! anybody got anything?,9,18
chandler,No.,9,18
phoebe,I'm still looking through mine...,9,18
monica,"Just double checking ...no, no, no... No!",9,18
monica,Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.,9,18
chandler,"Ah, the ""I'm sorry I rejected you"" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys.  Hey, Steve.",9,18
steve,"Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.",9,18
chandler,"Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!",9,18
steve,"Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.",9,18
chandler,"Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?",9,18
steve,"Yes, that is right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.",9,18
chandler,"Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .",9,18
chandler,"What?  Oh, yeah, I'm going to be a junior copywriter.",9,18
everybody,"Oh my God, congratulations!",9,18
monica,"Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!",9,18
chandler,Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?,9,18
monica,You bet! No TV or anything!,9,18
joey,"Hey, that is so great about the job.",9,18
chandler,"Thanks, man.",9,18
joey,And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.,9,18
chandler,Really? What?,9,18
joey,"Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.",9,18
chandler,"Oh yeah?  Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.",9,18
joey,Oh yeah.,9,18
rachel,You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were going to win.,9,18
ross,Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.,9,18
phoebe,"You guys, what was the Powerball number again?",9,18
monica and ross,Seven.,9,18
phoebe,We won.,9,18
rachel,What?,9,18
phoebe,We won!,9,18
monica,Let me see!,9,18
phoebe,Don't tear it.,9,18
ross,"Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.",9,18
phoebe,"I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!",9,18
chandler,"Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.",9,18
phoebe,"I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!",9,18
rachel,"So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?",9,18

monica,You know what? You can have mine.,9,18
chandler,Me too.,9,18
joey,Me too.,9,18
rachel,Me too.,9,18
ross,I guess if everybody else is...,9,18
joey,"Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.",9,18
phoebe,I beg to differ .,9,18
gunther,"Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside, and won $10,000 .",9,18
phoebe,"Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo!  Seriously, stop staring at her.",9,18
joey,"God, you are beautiful...why are we fighting this? You know you want it to happen as much as I do.",9,19
joey,I want you. I need you. Let me make love to you.,9,19
rachel,"I don't want to stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a  cantaloupe might hurt less.",9,19
joey,"Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines. They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!",9,19
rachel,Wow! I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were going to be with a real talking dog!,9,19
joey,"Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey! do you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?",9,19
rachel,Are you serious?,9,19
joey,"Yeah! Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.",9,19
rachel,"Hey, that was an honest mistake!",9,19
joey,"Right! ""OH my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?""",9,19
rachel,"Yeah, that was an awesome day!",9,19
monica,Hey!,9,19

monica,Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!,9,19
phoebe,"Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!",9,19
ross,"Phoebe, what happened?",9,19
phoebe,"Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!",9,19
chandler,Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!,9,19
phoebe,Oh no! You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!,9,19
chandler,"What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !",9,19
phoebe,"Oh, good! Ok, good for you! Try to recapture the magic!",9,19
chandler,"So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?",9,19
monica,"Oh, honey! I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!",9,19
chandler,Are you really that busy?,9,19
monica,"Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.",9,19
chandler,"Oh, that is ok. I'll just try and reschedule.  ""Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it  Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time?  Oh, can't you make an exception?""",9,19
monica,Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!,9,19
phoebe,And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!,9,19
chandler,"""Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?""  ""Oh, thank you very much!""  Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...",9,19
ross,"Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.",9,19
chandler,I don't have travel insurance.,9,19
ross,"Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!",9,19
monica,Why don't you take Ross?,9,19
ross,"Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...",9,19
monica,"No, not if their room has two beds!",9,19
ross,I guess...It still seems a little... moonlight boat ride!!,9,19
rachel,"Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?",9,19
joey,"I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!",9,19
rachel,"Oh, please! Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders? He's so gorgeous!",9,19
joey,Also so gay!,9,19

phoebe,"Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!",9,19

ross,Check again please!,9,19
receptionist,"I'm sorry, it's not here.",9,19
ross,Not there.,9,19
chandler,"Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?",9,19
receptionist,I don't know what to say.,9,19
ross,She doesn't know what to say!,9,19
chandler,Just give us the cheapest room you have.,9,19
receptionist,"Unfortunately the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.",9,19
chandler,that is insane!,9,19
ross,"Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.",9,19
chandler,Does that room have a closet I can lock him in?  We'll take it.,9,19
receptionist,Great.,9,19
chandler,What!? They are totally ripping us off!,9,19
ross,"Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!",9,19
chandler,"Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!",9,19
ross,"C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!",9,19
chandler,"Dude, you are shaking!",9,19
ross,"I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?",9,19
rachel,Hi!,9,19
joey,Hey!,9,19
rachel,"Joey, I got to tell you, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!",9,19

rachel,"Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.",9,19
joey,I can't believe you married him.,9,19
rachel,But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!,9,19
joey,So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.,9,19
rachel,It's over! You have to accept that.,9,19
joey,"How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.",9,19
rachel,Kiss me.,9,19
joey,What?,9,19
rachel,Kiss me.,9,19
joey,"Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!",9,19
rachel,"No, I'm saying...",9,19
joey,"but, but..",9,19
rachel,just... don't talk...,9,19
rachel,"Eh, aw! . Well, that is new!",9,19
ross,"Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?  Thank you! Ok.

Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already?  Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.",9,19
ross,What did you get?,9,19
chandler,USA Today,9,19
ross,"Nice, put it with the others.",9,19
chandler,And I also got... two more apples.,9,19
ross,"We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!",9,19
chandler,I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.,9,19
ross,"Oh, that is not cool.",9,19
chandler,"Dude, none of this is cool.",9,19
ross,"No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example",9,19
chandler,"I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.",9,19
ross,"Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.",9,19
chandler,"Ok, how about this ?",9,19
ross,"No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!",9,19
chandler,"Yes, but the batteries...",9,19
chandler,"Thank you, thank you very much!",9,19
ross,Let's celebrate with some maple candy!,9,19
chandler,No!,9,19
ross,At least tell me where you hid it.,9,19
rachel,Can I ask you a question?,9,19
monica,Yeah.,9,19
rachel,Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?,9,19
monica,"Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.",9,19
rachel,"Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.",9,19
monica,"Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?",9,19
rachel,"Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.",9,19
monica,What do you think brought than on?,9,19
rachel,"I don't know! I mean, maybe that is something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.",9,19
monica,A love scene? With who?,9,19
rachel,Olivia.,9,19
monica,"Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right, real life more important.",9,19
rachel,So do you think that my dream means anything?,9,19
monica,"I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.",9,19
rachel,Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...,9,19
monica,"Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.",9,19
rachel,You took the same class twice.,9,19
monica,It was hard!,9,19
phoebe,Hey!,9,19
rachel and monica,Hi.,9,19
phoebe,"Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant  uh, huh wait!  Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.",9,19
monica,"Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.",9,19
phoebe,"Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.",9,19
monica,"Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.",9,19
phoebe,"Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back .",9,19
rachel,"Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...",9,19
phoebe,My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?,9,19
rachel,"Ok, we're still on that.",9,19
monica,I didn't say your songs were not good enough.,9,19
phoebe,Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?,9,19
monica,Tiny portions?,9,19
phoebe,"Yeah well, ""excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but  I can't see it, I can't see it""!",9,19
monica,"Phoebe, it's not about quantity.",9,19
phoebe,Well...it's not about quality.,9,19
monica,"Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.",9,19
phoebe,"Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.",9,19
monica,"Ok, so that is what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.",9,19
phoebe,"Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?",9,19
monica,"You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.",9,19
phoebe,"What are people having, the garlic Martini?",9,19
receptionist,"Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.",9,19
chandler,"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",9,19
chandler,"Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.",9,19
ross,"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.",9,19
ross,Oh my god.,9,19
chandler,What?,9,19
ross,There's something new in the bowl.,9,19
chandler,"Look, we have enough, just walk away.",9,19
ross,"No, but I want...I want the pinecones!",9,19
chandler,There's a forest right outside.,9,19
ross,It's not the same.,9,19
chandler,"Ok, go quick!",9,19
ross,Thank you for a delightful stay.,9,19
ross,"Oh, my maple candy!",9,19
phoebe,Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you.. the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..,9,19
monica,"Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.",9,19
phoebe,"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not going to overuse itself.",9,19
monica,"Ok, you have to stop playing now.",9,19
phoebe,Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!,9,19
monica,"Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!",9,19
phoebe,Get your garlic-peelers off me!,9,19
monica,"Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller.. I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question",9,19
phoebe,"Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  Ha!",9,19
monica,"Alright, let me ask you this question",9,19
phoebe,"Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?",9,19
monica,Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?,9,19
phoebe,"Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .",9,19
monica,Excuse us!  Alright here's a question,9,19
phoebe,Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!,9,19
monica,I'm sorry...,9,19
phoebe,I'm sorry too...,9,19
monica,ooh... hey! want to stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?,9,19
phoebe,Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...,9,19
phoebe,Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?,9,19
rachel,Hey!,9,19
joey,Hey!,9,19
rachel,"Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?",9,19
joey,Oh man! I thought I got it all!,9,19
rachel,How...how...?,9,19
joey,"I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?",9,19
rachel,uh-huh,9,19
joey,"And I couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!",9,19
rachel,Wow...definitely just Drake...,9,19
joey,What?,9,19
rachel,What...how is it going with Drake?,9,19
joey,Oh...I don't think it's going very well...,9,19
rachel,What...that scene I saw was so good!,9,19
joey,"Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...",9,19
rachel,"Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you are bad so I'll give you a compliment?",9,19
joey,"A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.",9,19
rachel,So?,9,19
joey,So...I've never played that!,9,19
rachel,"Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?",9,19
joey,Uh...well...just once...with you...,9,19
rachel,Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?,9,19
joey,What the hell are you talking about??,9,19
rachel,"Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you are playing the scene.",9,19
joey,"Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.",9,19
rachel,"Joey, you never. You never talked about that before...",9,19
joey,"Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, because I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.",9,19
joey,Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!!,9,19
chandler,I got you something from Vermont!,9,19
monica,Besides tampons and salt?  Ooh! My God! Maple candy! that is so sweet of you.  that is weird...it's empty!,9,19
ross,"Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys want to hang out...or...?  do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?",9,19
joey,"Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?",9,20
chandler,"Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.",9,20
joey,"Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.",9,20
chandler,I could fall asleep at a play.,9,20
phoebe,What is it?,9,20
joey,"It's a one-woman play called ""Why don't you like me",9,20
monica,It sounds interesting!,9,20
ross,"Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...",9,20
phoebe,"I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?",9,20
joey,"You guys are going to have a great time, I promise!",9,20
ross,What? How come that you don't have to go!,9,20
joey,"I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.",9,20
chandler,"Uh, let's see, who do I hate?",9,20
rachel,"Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.",9,20
joey,"Hey, here you go.",9,20
rachel,"Ooh... ooh...   oh, ah...   Can I ask you a question?",9,20
monica,Yeah.,9,20
rachel,Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?,9,20
monica,"No, I don't think it ever works. Why?",9,20
rachel,No reason.,9,20
monica,"No, no, Rachel?",9,20
rachel,Yeah,9,20
monica,Who do you want to fool around with?,9,20
rachel,"Nobody, forget it!",9,20
rachel,Maybe.,9,20
monica,You can't!,9,20
rachel,Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.,9,20
monica,In the hall.,9,20
monica,You want to fool around with Joey?,9,20
rachel,"Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!",9,20
monica,Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?,9,20
rachel,"Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.",9,20
monica,"Who, who are they?",9,20
rachel,I know them from work.,9,20
monica,Both of them?,9,20
rachel,"No, one of them...",9,20
monica,Which one?,9,20
rachel,"I don't know, what were the names I just said?",9,20
monica,"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.",9,20
rachel,"All right, all right, you are right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we  Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?",9,20
monica,What the hell are you cooking!,9,20
ross,Hey!,9,20
monica,Hey!,9,20
chandler,Hey!,9,20

chandler,"Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.",9,20
ross,There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.,9,20
monica,What's so bad about that?,9,20
ross,It's I just know they're going to be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.,9,20
monica,,9,20
ross,These aren't suede.,9,20
charlie,"Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?",9,20

monica,Is he going to introduce us?,9,20
chandler,"No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.",9,20
charlie,"And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.",9,20
ross,"Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.",9,20
monica,Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.,9,20
ross,"We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.",9,20
charlie,"Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?",9,20
ross,I don't think so.,9,20
charlie,"I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?",9,20
ross,"Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if you can't come on time, then don't come at all"".  An option that many of my students use.  Shall we?",9,20
charlie,You don't think we should wait for him?,9,20
ross,"You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?",9,20

rachel,And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were going to get away with that?,9,20
joey,I do it every year.,9,20
rachel,You do that every year??,9,20
joey,I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!,9,20
rachel,"Oh, that is why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??",9,20
joey,Yeah...,9,20
rachel,And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?,9,20
joey,Yeah...,9,20
rachel,"OH! And the year before that, when you set up that night time tour of that button factory?",9,20
joey,I can't believe you guys went for that one!,9,20
rachel,"Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?",9,20
joey,"you are fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!",9,20
rachel,"Well, then so you just invite me...!",9,20

rachel,"OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!!  And it's out of my system!",9,20
professor spafford,"And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.",9,20
ross,"So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?",9,20
professor spafford,And that is not all I'm allergic to.,9,20
ross,"Oh, it's not over!",9,20
professor spafford,"I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...",9,20
ross,So basically all nuts?,9,20
professor spafford,Interestingly... no.,9,20
charlie,"kind of playing fast and loose with the word ""interesting"".",9,20
professor spafford,If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom.,9,20
charlie,Oh my God!!,9,20
ross,I've lost the will to live.,9,20
charlie,Let's ditch him!,9,20
ross,What?,9,20
charlie,"Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!",9,20
ross,"Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm...  When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...",9,20
charlie,"Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!!",9,20
ross,"Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.",9,20
phoebe,Hi!,9,20
ross,"Yeah, Charlie is going to be joining my department.",9,20
phoebe,"Oh, you are a palaeontologist, too!  Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthropods?",9,20
charlie,"Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...",9,20
phoebe,"Ah, ah.",9,20
charlie,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me.",9,20
ross,Ranion's theory of species variegation?,9,20
phoebe,"Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!",9,20
monica,"So, did you two have fun?",9,20
ross,"Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...",9,20
monica,And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a  HOTTY!!  HI!,9,20
rachel,"Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.",9,20
ross,Really? Wh-what's wrong?,9,20
rachel,"I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!",9,20
charlie,"Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.",9,20
rachel,"... Ok, who is this?",9,20
ross,"I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a colleague.",9,20
rachel,"Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!",9,20
monica,"Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?",9,20
rachel,Sure!  Oh...,9,20
monica,you are not sick!,9,20
rachel,"What? Yes, I am!",9,20
monica,"Ok, then, why are you...  all dressed up??",9,20
rachel,"When you are sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!",9,20
monica,You just want to stay home so you can make a move on Joey!,9,20
rachel,"Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!",9,20
monica,"Ok, what is this?",9,20
rachel,Ok!  Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!,9,20
monica,WHAT?,9,20
ross,Wh-what's going on?,9,20
monica,Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!,9,20
rachel,And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!,9,20
charlie,I thought you came to say you were sick.,9,20
rachel,Ok professor or detective?,9,20
phoebe,Joey's having a party and he wasn't going to invite us?,9,20
rachel,"Yeah, and he does it every year! that is why he's sending you to that play! that is why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!",9,20
phoebe,And that horrible museum tour!,9,20
ross,"No, I arranged that...",9,20
joey,"Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.",9,20
phoebe,We know about your party Joey.,9,20

monica,Oh yeah that is what you want - my inhibitions lowered.,9,20
phoebe,Hey!,9,20
monica,"Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.",9,20
phoebe,"Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway?",9,20
monica,Oh my God! Chandler!,9,20
chandler,Where the hell is everybody?,9,20
bitter lady,Why don't you like me?! Chapter One,9,20
monica,"Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's getting one, then I want one too",9,20
rachel,"Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.",9,20
monica,Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!,9,20
matthew ashford,It was nice to meet you Rachel.,9,20
rachel,Nice to meet you.,9,20

rachel,Ok,9,20
monica,We will!!,9,20
monica,Look at you with all the guys!,9,20
rachel,Yeah!,9,20
monica,I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?,9,20
rachel,"Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!",9,20
monica,Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... ooh leather pants! Have Mercy!,9,20
ross,"So, eh... it's probably going to be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?",9,20
charlie,"Actually, I'm kind of happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someone.",9,20
ross,"Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?",9,20
charlie,"Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.",9,20
ross,You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?,9,20
charlie,Yeah...,9,20
ross,... And you called him Alby!?  I mean that is like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...,9,20
charlie,"Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.",9,20
ross,"Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!",9,20
charlie,"Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...",9,20
ross,"Oh! like what?!  Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""Access Hollywood"".",9,20
charlie,"Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.",9,20
ross,Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?,9,20
charlie,A guy who won two.,9,20
ross,Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart,9,20
charlie,Yeah... for three years.,9,20
ross,Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?,9,20
charlie,... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.,9,20
ross,"Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?",9,20
charlie,"No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.",9,20
ross,Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?,9,20
phoebe,Hey Ross!,9,20
rache,How is it going with Charlie?,9,20
ross,Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.,9,20
phoebe,"Oh, What's the matter?",9,20
ross,"She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the Chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.",9,20
rachel,I always loved that!!,9,20
ross,"Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!  Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!",9,20
phoebe,Worse?,9,20
ross,"Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...  ""Can we walk""?  Oh, you... you like that?",9,20
phoebe,No.,9,20
ross,What?,9,20
rachel,Come on! I think this is funny!,9,20
bitter lady,"Well, I bet you are all thinking' ""Now would be a really great time for an intermission"", huh?",9,20
chandler,"oh yes, God yes!!",9,20
bitter lady,"Well, you are not going to get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7",9,20
chandler,I... I don't know... you seem lovely.,9,20
joey,"Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.",9,20
ross,Nice to meet you.,9,20
dirk,Hey! So what show are you on?,9,20
ross,"Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.",9,20
joey,It's a science.,9,20
dirk,"Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on ""Days"". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.",9,20
joey,"Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...",9,20
ross,"Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.",9,20
dirk,"Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.",9,20
ross,I'd lead with that.,9,20
monica,"that is it, just sign right on the bra .",9,20
joey,Monica!,9,20
monica,"Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!",9,20
joey,What have you got there?,9,20
ross,Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.,9,20
joey,"Ah, let me see!  Damn, that is a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?",9,20
rachel,I think I am.,9,20
joey,"Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.",9,20
joey,"Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...",9,20
rachel,"Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?",9,20
joey,"Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.",9,20
rachel,"Joey, you are so sweet.",9,20
joey,"that is true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you are going to go home with tonight.",9,20
rachel,Who ?,9,20
joey,Me.,9,20
rachel,What?  Really?,9,20
joey,"Yes, Because we live together, that is a joke!",9,20
rachel,"Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!",9,20
joey,Gotcha.,9,20
rachel,"Oh, Very funny... Joey.",9,20
chandler,"So, how did you enjoy the play?",9,20
monica,"Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.",9,20
chandler,Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theatre.,9,20
monica,You really liked it?,9,20
chandler,"Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained  not to listen!  But after chapter 16",9,20
monica,Oh really!,9,20
chandler,"Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!",9,20
monica,No!,9,20
chandler,Did somebody sign your bra?,9,20
monica,So I got it when I was 13...,9,20
phoebe,"Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just going to let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?",9,20
ross,"It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.",9,20
phoebe,"Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know,  slum it with some average Joe PhD.",9,20
ross,"Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.",9,20
phoebe,"you are so much more than just brains! you are sweet, and kind, and funny...",9,20
ross,And sexy.,9,20
phoebe,Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!,9,20
ross,"Yeah, you are right, thanks Pheebs, I'm going to go find her.",9,20
phoebe,"Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!",9,20
ross,Stop going through my stuff !,9,20
rachel,Hey!,9,20
monica,Hey!,9,20
rachel,I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind,9,20
monica,"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.",9,20
rachel,"Please, what about you and Chandler?",9,20
monica,that is different! I was drunk and stupid!,9,20
rachel,Well hello !,9,20
monica,What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?,9,20
rachel,"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!",9,20
monica,Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.,9,20
rachel,I'm going to do it.,9,20
monica,And I can't stop you.,9,20
rachel,No.,9,20
ross,"Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?",9,20
ross,I'm smarter than him!,9,20
phoebe,"Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.",9,20
chandler,"Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.",9,20
monica,"Oh, you are so wonderful.",9,20
bitter woman,Why don't you like me! Chapter one,9,20
chandler,"Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .",9,20
monica,"It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?    I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.",9,21
ross,"Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!",9,21
chandler,"I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right?",9,21
ross,"Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did    not kiss.",9,21
rachel,"I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls    at the party, GOD!",9,21
ross,Why do you care so much?,9,21
monica,"Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?",9,21
rachel,Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know...    and I... want him to hook up with lots of women!  I just... All I'm saying    is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.,9,21
ross,"Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each    other's tonsils...",9,21
phoebe,"Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids    and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh,    those nerds will get laid!",9,21
rachel,"All right, so... Ross, you are ok with all this? I mean...",9,21
ross,"Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with    it...",9,21
ross,"Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!",9,21
joey,Hey!,9,21
all,Hi!,9,21
ross,I'm going to get some more coffee.,9,21
charlie,"Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!",9,21
ross,Ok.,9,21
chandler,"So, a professor, uh?",9,21
joey,"Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious    .  that is not    how she used it...?",9,21
charlie,"I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't    ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed.    I really hope you don't think less of me.",9,21
ross,"Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean,    you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like    someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.",9,21
charlie,"You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean,    Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors,    and intellectuals, and palaeontologists mostly, you    know, very cerebral...",9,21
ross,"Yeah, I know the type.",9,21
joey,"Hey, if you want to grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious.    No? Am I getting close?",9,21
phoebe,Hey!,9,21
monica,Hey!,9,21
phoebe,Hey you guys! Look what I just got.,9,21
rachel,"Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?",9,21
phoebe,I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania    Twain.,9,21
rachel,"Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!",9,21
phoebe,Oh... then I overpaid.,9,21
monica,"Hey, what's this?",9,21
rachel,"Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.",9,21
monica,"Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage    chains.",9,21
rachel,"Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things    that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...",9,21
monica,Do you want to go hunting?,9,21
rachel,"Well, I would like to have the option!!",9,21
phoebe,"What's up?  Hey, Rachel!!",9,21
rachel,Oh!,9,21
phoebe,"No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these ""big    massage places""! They're putting people like me out of business!",9,21
monica,"And she wants to go hunting, too!!",9,21
rachel,"Phoebe, come on, I don't want to waste it! It would be like throwing    away a hundred bucks!",9,21
phoebe,"Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's    about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.",9,21
rachel,I don't care about any of that!!,9,21
phoebe,"Well, do you care about friendship?",9,21
rachel,Oh!,9,21
phoebe,"I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use    this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.",9,21
rachel,"Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!",9,21
phoebe,Promise?,9,21
rachel,I promise.,9,21
phoebe,Thank you.,9,21
rachel,But I am going hunting!!,9,21
monica,Hey honey! I missed you today!,9,21
chandler,"Oh, yeah?",9,21
monica,Yeah.  What d'you want to do tonight?,9,21
chandler,"Oh, well... Maybe we could...",9,21
monica,"Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience!    Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank.",9,21
chandler,We really need to take those tests?,9,21
monica,"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.",9,21
chandler,But I don't want to do it in a cup!,9,21
monica,What is the big deal?,9,21
chandler,It's weird! In a doctor's office?,9,21
monica,It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do    it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?,9,21
chandler,"I cannot believe Ross told you that!     And in my defence, it was a Wendy's!",9,21
monica,"Look, I don't want to do this test either, but I really do think    it's a good idea!",9,21
chandler,"Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than    on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!",9,21
monica,OH!,9,21
chandler,"Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!",9,21
joey,Who says that wine has to cost    more than milk!,9,21
joey,Hey!,9,21
charlie,Hi!,9,21
joey,"Come on in, how are you?",9,21
charlie,I'm good!,9,21
joey,Can I offer you a drink?,9,21
charlie,"Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with    the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword    for a friend's book...",9,21
joey,"Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to    open a door and go  oh!",9,21
charlie,So I am just so excited to be    here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!,9,21
joey,"Hey, if you need a tour guide...",9,21
charlie,"Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!",9,21
joey,"Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you want to see first?",9,21
charlie,"Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher    Hall.",9,21
joey,Ok!,9,21
charlie,And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display    at the public library.,9,21
joey,"I know, yeah!",9,21
charlie,"And first, I have to see the MET!",9,21
joey,"Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You want to    see the Yankees.",9,21
charlie,"No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!",9,21
joey,"Which one, they all suck!",9,21
charlie,The museum!,9,21
joey,I don't think so.,9,21
rachel,Hi there!,9,21
receptionist,"Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa    SPA. How may I help you?",9,21
rachel,"Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and    here is my gift certificate.",9,21
receptionist,This has been torn up.,9,21
rachel,And... taped back together.,9,21
receptionist,"Ok well, I'll call you as    soon as your massage therapist is ready.",9,21
rachel,Ok,9,21
receptionist,Have a seat through the glass doors.,9,21
rachel,through the glass doors.,9,21
receptionist,Through the glass doors.,9,21
rachel,Alright-y then.,9,21
receptionist,"Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.",9,21
phoebe,"Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around?  Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone    who can fill in for me?",9,21
receptionist,"Sorry, everyone is booked!",9,21
phoebe,But that woman can't know I work    here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this    massage chains are.,9,21
receptionist,Then why you work here?,9,21
phoebe,because it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!,9,21
receptionist,"Well, I think this is a great place to work!",9,21
phoebe,"Ok, are they listening?",9,21
joey,Ross!,9,21
ross,Hi!,9,21
joey,I need to talk to you about Charlie.,9,21
ross,"Oh, do you, do you really?",9,21
joey,"Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.",9,21
ross,"Look, if you don't know what the word ""acrimonious""    means, just don't use it!",9,21
joey,"No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her    body is so...",9,21
ross,Get to the problem!,9,21
joey,Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've    ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!,9,21
ross,Are you wearing two belts?,9,21
joey,"EH, what do you know!",9,21
ross,You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.,9,21
joey,"Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural    places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You got to help me out!",9,21
ross,"You know, I really don't want to    get involved in you guy's relationship.",9,21
joey,"Please, c'mon, you are the smartest person I know and I really    like this girl, ok, I don't want to lose her.",9,21
ross,Fine.,9,21
joey,Thanks.,9,21
ross,"Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!",9,21
joey,The Metsss!,9,21
ross,"Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.",9,21
joey,"Oh, that is what she meant!  You know, if they're    going to shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!",9,21
ross,"Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry    baseball fans!",9,21
joey,"Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.",9,21
ross,"Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore    on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture,    you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the    Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that    she'd love.",9,21
joey,"Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!",9,21
ross,But I'm not! . You know what if you are in the mood for    Thai food...,9,21
joey,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too    fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?",9,21
ross,Ok.,9,21
joey,You got to tell me exactly what to do there.,9,21
ross,"Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that is the antiquities    wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.",9,21
joey,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make    the right",9,21
chandler,I have a weird feeling about this place.  How do I    know that they are not going to secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.,9,21
monica,"Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody    is going to want to watch that.",9,21
nurse,Mr. Bing?  Here you are! You'll go into that    room and deposit your specimen into the container.,9,21
chandler,"Deposit my specimen? You know,    usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind    of talk. Thanks, got it.",9,21
monica,"Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you are going    to be ok?",9,21
chandler,"Yeah, I guess!",9,21
monica,"I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even    knows you!",9,21
janice,OH MY GOD!!,9,21
chandler,"Oh, Come on!",9,21
janice,Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!,9,21
monica,"Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!",9,21
chandler,Why are you here?,9,21
janice,"Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...",9,21
chandler,"No no no... I mean, why? why is    she here??",9,21
janice,Oh! Someone's a little cranky today because    they have to do it in a cup!  Oh! They gave you the kiddy size .,9,21
chandler,What!?,9,21
monica,This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!,9,21
chandler,"I'd love to stay, but I have eh...  got    a hot date...",9,21
janice,Please... go!  Just let me know if you    need a hand!,9,21
chandler,I think it just fell off.,9,21
phoebe,"Hello ""ja"", it's time    for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.",9,21
rachel,"Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.",9,21
phoebe,"Okay, then I'm Swedish...",9,21
monica,"So, what's your name?",9,21
phoebe,It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...,9,21
rachel,Oh... what an interesting name.,9,21
phoebe,Ja!,9,21
rachel,You know I...,9,21
phoebe,Time for your scalp massage!,9,21
rachel,Wow... I really love    your...,9,21
phoebe,Is something wrong?,9,21
rachel,"No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea...     Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?",9,21
phoebe,Uhm... Stockholm.,9,21
rachel,Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!,9,21
joey,Note the painterly    lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.,9,21
ross,"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?",9,21
joey,,9,21
ross,"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.",9,21
joey,Phonetically?,9,21
ross,"Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.",9,21
joey,Ok.,9,21
ross,"Ok, but you know what? I got to say,    I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!",9,21
joey,"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days""    I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy"".",9,21
ross,Wow. What does that mean?,9,21
joey,"No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means ""you are going to get eaten by a bear"".",9,21
ross,Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?,9,21
joey,"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .",9,21
ross,"Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't touch the paintings.",9,21
joey,Come on! you...,9,21
ross,No!,9,21
chandler,My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.    Really helped speed the process along!  Janice! you are not... gone?,9,21
janice,Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?,9,21
chandler,Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!,9,21
janice,"that is not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?",9,21
chandler,I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was going to be ok.,9,21
janice,"Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.",9,21
chandler,"Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?",9,21
janice,"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's going to be just fine.",9,21
chandler,"oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe    I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...",9,21
janice,"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?",9,21
chandler,"It was a ""Wendy's!!    """,9,21
phoebe,"""Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! "" And that is    the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking!",9,21
rachel,"Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have    a friend who is a masseuse.",9,21
phoebe,"Oh, Ja! Ja!",9,21
rachel,Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...,9,21
phoebe,"Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?",9,21
rachel,I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy    fingers from playing crummy guitar...,9,21
phoebe,Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you are    such a high maintenance tight ass!,9,21
rachel,Phoebe!!,9,21
phoebe,You know it's me?,9,21
rachel,"For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!",9,21
phoebe,How can you come here?,9,21
rachel,How could you not tell me you worked here?,9,21
phoebe,I don't have to tell you everything!,9,21
rachel,"Yes you do, if you are going to make me feel guilty for getting    a free massage!",9,21
phoebe,Tips not included.,9,21
rachel,"Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?",9,21
phoebe,"Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then    they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know...    you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh!    paying taxes!",9,21
rachel,"Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there    right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles    and I so admire that! I don't have any!",9,21
phoebe,You know what? You are right. I am going to quit. It's time    I took my life back!,9,21
rachel,Good for you Pheebs!,9,21
phoebe,Ok.,9,21
phoebe,"Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any    of that. I love you.",9,21
ross,"Haha! Got you! Die, die, die!",9,21
ross,"Respectfully, professor    R. Geller.  Hey!",9,21
charlie,Hi!,9,21
ross,"Hey, how was the Met?",9,21
charlie,The museum was amazing!,9,21
ross,"Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?",9,21
charlie,"Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to    say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.",9,21
ross,What do you mean?,9,21
charlie,"Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere    around.",9,21
ross,"Wait a minute... when you guys walked    into the Met, did you go to the right?",9,21
charlie,"No, we went to the left.",9,21
ross,"Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like    you guys are having a great time together.",9,21
charlie,"Yeah, it's fun .",9,21
ross,What?,9,21
charlie,"Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really    know me that well; it would be weird.",9,21
ross,"What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.",9,21
charlie,"Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy    to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common    with. You know what I mean?",9,21
ross,"Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey    a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about    art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.",9,21
charlie,"Yeah, I guess that is true.",9,21
ross,"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You    know, that is the kind of guy Joey is.",9,21
charlie,He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!,9,21
ross,That was going to be my next argument.,9,21
joey,Hey!,9,21
ross,Hey!,9,21
charlie,Hey!,9,21
joey,you are ready?,9,21
charlie,"Yeah, let's go.   Thanks    Ross.",9,21
joey,"Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me    up.",9,21
ross,Glad I could help man.,9,21
joey,"Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was going to    be, but...  I made it work.",9,21
chandler,It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.,9,21
chandler,"Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly.  No, she's not here    but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this?  Oh.  Well, so what does that mean?     Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks.",9,21
monica,Hey sweetie.,9,21
chandler,Doctor Connelly just called.,9,21
monica,"With good news?  Of course    it is not good news, you just said  ""Doctor Connelly just called"".    If it was good news you would have said  ""Doctor Connelly just    called! "" But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem    with me or with you?",9,21
chandler,Actually it's both of us.,9,21
monica,What?,9,21
chandler,Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable    environment.,9,21
monica,Oh... what does that mean?,9,21
chandler,It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers    and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It    means...,9,21
monica,Chandler?,9,21
chandler,"It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us.",9,21
monica,Oh my God!,9,21
chandler,I'm sorry.,9,21
monica,I'm sorry too.,9,21
chandler,"Well, we're going to... we're going to figure this out.",9,21
monica,I know.,9,21
receptionist,Good morning Phoebe.,9,21
phoebe,Good morning receptionist.,9,21
receptionist,Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is    in room No. 1.,9,21
phoebe,"Rachel Green?  Son of a bitch, she came back?",9,21
phoebe,"Are you ready for    your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.",9,21
charlie,Oh! That feels so good!,9,22
rachel,"Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!",9,22
charlie,"I'm sorry, what?",9,22
rachel,"Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.",9,22
charlie,From... Cosmo??,9,22
rachel,"Yeah, yeah... It's... ""climax your way to better skin"".",9,22
charlie,"So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm so bad at picking out clothes!",9,22
joey,"So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.",9,22
rachel,"Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!",9,22
joey,Oh hey Rach!,9,22
rachel,Yeah...,9,22
joey,Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.,9,22
rachel,"Oh, well...",9,22
charlie,I'm sure you have better things to do.,9,22
joey,"Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you are trying on clothes.",9,22
charlie,"If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.",9,22
rachel,"Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!",9,22
joey,"Ok, you are going to come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!",9,22
phoebe,"Ok, great! All right, bye!  Pain in the ass!!  that is off, right?",9,22
joey,"What's the matter, Pheebs?",9,22
phoebe,"Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's going to be there. And she was like ""Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!"". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!",9,22
rachel,"Which you are not, because you've totally hung up on him!",9,22
phoebe,Exactly!,9,22
rachel,And you are going to want him to eat his heart out so you are going to have to look fabulous!,9,22
phoebe,"I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh, sexual politics!!",9,22
rachel,"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.",9,22
phoebe,"Ok, that'll be great!",9,22
joey,"Oh, isn't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.",9,22
rachel,that is not what we're going to do!,9,22
joey,"Why would you ruin it, who was that hurting'?",9,22
chandler,Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!,9,22
monica,"Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!",9,22
chandler,"Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!",9,22
doctor connelly,Hi there.,9,22
chandler,Hi.,9,22
monica,Hi.,9,22
doctor connelly,I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.,9,22
monica,Ok.,9,22
doctor connelly,"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.",9,22
chandler,"Oh, DAMN IT!",9,22
monica,"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",9,22
doctor connelly,"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",9,22
monica,Ok.,9,22
doctor connelly,"And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.",9,22
chandler,"Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!  Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!",9,22
rachel,"Hi! Ok, you are ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?",9,22
charlie,"Oh, yeah! Let's do it!",9,22
joey,"Alright, have a good time.",9,22
rachel,Not going to find any clothes in there!,9,22
ross,"Hey, you guys!",9,22
rachel,Hi.,9,22
ross,Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Palaeontology Conference?,9,22
charlie,Umh... Kurts Baley?,9,22
ross,"Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well, why are you laughing?",9,22
joey,"Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a palaeontologist... it's fun, yeah!",9,22
charlie,So you are up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?,9,22
ross,"Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.",9,22
charlie,He's a pretty tough guy to impress.,9,22
ross,"Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.",9,22
rachel,"Oh... you are not going to do a magic trick, are you?",9,22
ross,Tsz... NO! .,9,22
chandler,Hey guys!,9,22
ross,"Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I want to ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this palaeontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.",9,22
chandler,"I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.",9,22
ross,It's in Barbados.,9,22
chandler,But you come first!,9,22
rachel,I'm there!,9,22
charlie,"We'll see you, guys!",9,22
joey,Bye.,9,22
rachel,"Bye, see you.",9,22
chandler,Ok.,9,22
joey,"All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?",9,22
chandler,Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you are giving a sperm sample.,9,22
ross,So-so what did the doctor say?,9,22
chandler,"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",9,22
joey,So you are ruling out surrogacy?,9,22
chandler,Yeah.,9,22
joey,"So, I don't have to learn what that means?",9,22
chandler,"Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.",9,22
joey,"Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?",9,22
chandler,ah-ha!,9,22
ross,How do you feel about all this?,9,22
chandler,I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.,9,22
joey,"Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!",9,22
ross,What?,9,22
ross,What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!,9,22
ross,The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.,9,22
professor sherman,Mmm-mm.,9,22
ross,"I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash.  So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!",9,22
ross,"Oh, that is not what you want...",9,22
shop assistant,Incentive For Men?,9,22
phoebe,"Oh, I'll take some of that.",9,22
rachel,"Pheebs, that is for men!",9,22
phoebe,"No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm going to smell like another guy.  Yeah.",9,22
phoebe,"Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!",9,22
charlie,"So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?",9,22
rachel,"On Melanie Griffith in ""Working girl"". I think what you want is over here.",9,22
charlie,"See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a ""thank you"", I would really love to take you out.",9,22
rachel,Really?,9,22
charlie,"Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, want to come?",9,22
rachel,"Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.",9,22
charlie,You've seen all the movies...,9,22
rachel,"Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!",9,22
phoebe,"Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?",9,22
rachel,Sure!,9,22
phoebe,Ok!,9,22
charlie,"Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!",9,22
rachel,You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.,9,22
phoebe,"So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?",9,22
rachel,"She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!",9,22
phoebe,Why?,9,22
rachel,"I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!",9,22
phoebe,Who else?,9,22
rachel,"Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...",9,22
phoebe,You like Joey?,9,22
rachel,"Shh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.",9,22
phoebe,Oh my God!,9,22
rachel,"It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!",9,22
phoebe,"Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?",9,22
rachel,"Oh, I get it!",9,22
phoebe,"Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.",9,22
rachel,"I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.",9,22
phoebe,Yeah.,9,22
rachel,So can we keep this between us?,9,22
phoebe,Sure!,9,22
rachel,"Ok, great, because I got to get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!",9,22
phoebe,Oh.,9,22
phoebe,Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?,9,22
monica,Hi honey!,9,22
chandler,"Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!",9,22
monica,"Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!",9,22
zack,You too.,9,22
chandler,"You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! you are both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.",9,22
monica,I got it.,9,22
zack,Thanks.,9,22
chandler,"So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?",9,22
monica,"Yeah, I guess.",9,22
chandler,"So, how would you like to have a baby that is half yours and half his!",9,22
monica,Excuse me?,9,22
chandler,"Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!",9,22
monica,"Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!",9,22
chandler,"No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.",9,22
monica,Chandler!,9,22
chandler,"I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!",9,22
monica,I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!,9,22
chandler,Ok!,9,22
monica,Uh!,9,22
chandler,Zack!,9,22
zack,Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't want to make a ring.,9,22
monica,"Tell me about yourself, Zack!",9,22
rachel,"Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!",9,22
phoebe,"Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm going to go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.",9,22
rachel,"Ok, great!",9,22
rachel,"Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you are saying!",9,22
phoebe,I didn't say anything yet!,9,22
rachel,"Well, get back in there and talk!",9,22
phoebe,I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.,9,22
rachel,What!?,9,22
phoebe,"Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.",9,22
rachel,"Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!",9,22
phoebe,Ooh! We have a problem.,9,22
rachel,Oh! What are we going to do?,9,22
stranger,Just be honest with her.,9,22
rachel,Oh my God!,9,22
stranger,And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...,9,22
rachel,Alright! Enough out of you!,9,22
joey,Hello?,9,22
ross,"Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?",9,22
joey,No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?,9,22
ross,I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...,9,22
joey,Oh! How's it going?,9,22
ross,"It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!",9,22
joey,What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!,9,22
ross,Barbados.,9,22
joey,"Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!",9,22
ross,What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.,9,22
joey,"Well, just wake him up!",9,22
ross,"I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!",9,22
joey,"Uh! that is a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and...  no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?",9,22
monica,Hey guys! Dinner's ready!,9,22
zack,Oh! I'm going to go wash up first.  Thanks!,9,22
chandler,"So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheekbones!",9,22
monica,"Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!",9,22
chandler,You don't like him.,9,22
monica,I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.,9,22
chandler,Alright! Just follow my lead!,9,22
zack,You guys have such a great place here.,9,22
chandler,"Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?",9,22
zack,Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for  Dukakis.,9,22
chandler,that is really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.,9,22
zack,"Okay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.",9,22
monica,"Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you",9,22
zack,No...,9,22
monica,"Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimer's, gout?",9,22
zack,"You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?",9,22
monica,We're just making conversation.,9,22
zack,Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...,9,22
chandler,You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness,9,22
zack,"Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?",9,22
monica & chandler,Sure! Alright...,9,22
zack,Ravioli's delicious!,9,22
chandler,I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?,9,22
zack,No I didn't.,9,22
monica,Yes!!,9,22
chandler,We're teeth people Zack!,9,22
rachel,Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.,9,22
phoebe,Good plan.,9,22
rachel,Ok.  Wha...? where? Where are you going?,9,22
phoebe,"Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at ""who's more over who""!",9,22
rachel,"Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?",9,22
charlie,Oh! trying on clothes.,9,22
rachel,"Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that is so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!",9,22
charlie,Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.,9,22
rachel,"Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.",9,22
charlie,No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.,9,22
rachel,Yeah.,9,22
charlie,"It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?",9,22
rachel,"Yeah! that is Phoebe. that is Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!",9,22
charlie,Wow!,9,22
rachel,Yeah...,9,22
charlie,"You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person.",9,22
rachel,I try...,9,22
ross,Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you!,9,22
prof. sherman,you are welcome.,9,22
joey,Wow! You look... ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!,9,22
phoebe,Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.,9,22
joey,Then don't go!,9,22
phoebe,"Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! that is a very serious thing in my culture.",9,22
joey,"Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!",9,22
phoebe,"You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.",9,22
phoebe,David?,9,22
david,Phoebe! Hi!,9,22
phoebe,Oh my God!,9,22
david,"Wow, you look unbelievable.",9,22
phoebe,Yeah. What-what are you doing here?,9,22
david,"Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.",9,22
phoebe,What happened?,9,22
david,"Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?",9,22
phoebe,Yeah?,9,22
david,"Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.",9,22
phoebe,"Well, it's great that you are back! How are you?",9,22
david,"Good, good, life is good...",9,22
phoebe,Good!,9,22
david,"Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.",9,22
phoebe,"Oh, good for you.",9,22
david,"She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said ""Boy, I want that"".",9,22
phoebe,Mike and I broke up.,9,22
david,"you are kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up.",9,22
phoebe,Really?,9,22
david,"Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.",9,22
phoebe,"I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. that is so not like us!",9,22
david,"Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?",9,22
phoebe,Well...  no.,9,22
david,Do you want to get a drink?,9,22
phoebe,I'd love to.,9,22
david,Great.,9,22
phoebe,Ok.,9,22
david,Do you smell beets?,9,22
phoebe,"Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.",9,22
charlie,"Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?",9,22
rachel,"No, that is David.",9,22
charlie,There's a third guy?,9,22
rachel,Tip of the iceberg.,9,22
zack,"I'm going to take off now. you are going to let me go home, aren't you?",9,22
chandler,You sure you don't want to stick around a little longer?,9,22
zack,"No, no, I should get home, I'm kind of tired.",9,22
chandler,"Are you just tired now or are you always tired, Because that could be a sign of clinical depression.",9,22
zack,No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.,9,22
chandler,Ok.,9,22
chandler,I think we've found our sperm!,9,22
monica,Does seem pretty perfect.,9,22
chandler,"Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?",9,22
monica,No.,9,22
chandler,"Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are going to get that from you anyway!",9,22
monica,"No, that is not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.",9,22
chandler,"Yeah, he's better!",9,22
monica,"No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.",9,22
chandler,Really? Are you sure?,9,22
monica,"Yeah, I'm sure.",9,22
chandler,"Thank God, because I don't want to do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.",9,22
monica,That is so sweet. I love you.,9,22
chandler,So you know this leaves us with...,9,22
monica,Adoption.,9,22
chandler,How do you feel about that?,9,22
monica,I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.,9,22
chandler,Me too. I want to find a baby that needs a home and I want to raise it with you. And I want to mess it up in our own specific way.,9,22
monica,"So this is it, we're really going to adopt?",9,22
chandler,Yeah.,9,22
monica,"Oh my God, we're going to be parents!",9,22
chandler,We are going to be great parents.,9,22
monica,"And it could be soon. I mean, think about it",9,22
chandler,"Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!",9,22
chandler,"Hey, Zack!",9,22
zack,Hey Chandler.,9,22
chandler,"Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.",9,22
zack,No you didn't.,9,22
chandler,Really?,9,22
zack,No you did.,9,22
chandler,"My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.",9,22
jeanette,Here are the boards for Friday's pitch .,9,22
zack,"Oh, thank you.",9,22
chandler,"You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would you?",9,22
joey,Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!,9,23
ross,"Oh, that is right!  Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?",9,23
joey,Mmh-mmh.,9,23
ross,Can you say Barbados?,9,23
joey,Barbados!,9,23
ross,"Ok, I got to say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! that is right!  This babies will get you into all the palaeontology lectures and seminars.",9,23
rachel,Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?,9,23
chandler,"Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're going to want to do, you know, ""island's stuff"".",9,23
phoebe,I think David would probably want to hear a few lectures.,9,23
ross,"Oh, right, because he's a scientist!",9,23
phoebe,"No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.",9,23
ross,"Ok, we got to go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.",9,23
joey,"All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.",9,23
ross,"It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!",9,23
charlie,Wow! This place is beautiful!,9,23
ross,Look at all these palaeontologists!!,9,23
joey,"I know, there are going to be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!",9,23
woman,"Oh my God, I can't believe you are here!",9,23
joey,"I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!",9,23
woman,"Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!",9,23
joey,That... never happens...,9,23
woman,"I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.",9,23
ross,"Wow! This is very flattering, uh...",9,23
woman,I would love your autograph.,9,23
ross,"Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... ""Dear...""",9,23
woman,Sarah.,9,23
ross,"""... Sarah. I dig you"", Uh? ""Doctor Ross Geller"".",9,23
sarah,Thank you so much!,9,23
ross,"Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.",9,23
sarah,Are you a palaeontologist?,9,23
joey,"No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""The Days of Our Lives"".",9,23
ross,"Dude, it's just ""Days of Our Lives""... there's no the.",9,23
joey,"Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.",9,23
sarah,"I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.",9,23
joey,You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??,9,23
monica,"David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.",9,23
david,"Oh, certainly. that is a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.",9,23
monica,See?,9,23
chandler,"Yeah, that is the same as ""it has something to do with wind"".",9,23
monica,"Alright, I'm going to go pick up a few things for the trip.",9,23
phoebe,"Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys want to share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.",9,23
phoebe,Mike?? Who's Mike?,9,23
david,Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!,9,23
phoebe,"that is right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! that is-that is... a blast from the past!",9,23
david,It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.,9,23
phoebe,"Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!",9,23
chandler,She does?,9,23
monica,Let's get you out of here!!,9,23
monica,At least you took me down with you!,9,23
phoebe,"I'm so sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? that is-that is going to go away, right?",9,23
monica,"I guess, in time.",9,23
phoebe,Yeah.,9,23
monica,"I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.",9,23
phoebe,"You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!",9,23
david,"Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?",9,23
chandler,I wouldn't read too much into it.,9,23
david,"Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that is not a good thing, right?",9,23
chandler,"David, let me stop you there Because I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you want to advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.",9,23
david,"Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...",9,23
chandler,"Seriously, we're going to do this?",9,23
david,"I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?",9,23
chandler,"Oh, because his penis was too big.  Oh, I'm sorry, that is the kind of thing I do.  They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?",9,23
david,that is great! that is great! I-I'll propose to her!,9,23
chandler,What?,9,23
david,"Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.",9,23
chandler,I didn't mean now...,9,23
david,"Why not? It's brilliant!  Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!  well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...  Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.",9,23
chandler,"Well, you are welcome! Glad I could help.",9,23
david,How do you think I should propose?,9,23
chandler,"David, I'm pretending to read here!!",9,23
joey,Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!,9,23
joey,"Hey, hey! You said you are going to wear a thong, where's the thong?",9,23
charlie,I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...,9,23
joey,You really should have been more clear about that!,9,23
ross,Hey!,9,23
joey,Hey!,9,23
ross,you are never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!,9,23
joey,Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?,9,23
ross,"Yeah, she never misses these conferences!  No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!",9,23
charlie,Oh my God! Did you talk to him?,9,23
ross,Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?,9,23
joey,You could say,9,23
ross,Ready to go?,9,23
charlie,Yeah!,9,23
joey,Wha...? you are going to go now? I thought we could hang out?,9,23
charlie,Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.,9,23
ross,Yeah.,9,23
charlie,But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.,9,23
joey,Will you wear a thong?,9,23
charlie,I will if you will.,9,23
joey,Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!,9,23
ross,"I'm good, I have dinner plans .",9,23
charlie,So you'll be ok?,9,23
joey,"Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm going to hit the beach, go swimming...",9,23
ross,"Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?",9,23
joey,"No, why?",9,23
joey,Oh man!,9,23
charlie,"There's an indoor pool, you can swim there!",9,23
joey,"I wasn't going to swim, I was going to dig a hole!",9,23
monica,Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's going to happen with Phoebe and David.,9,23
chandler,"I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do""  ""I do"".",9,23
monica,"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.",9,23
chandler,David is going to propose to Phoebe.,9,23
monica,What?  Why?,9,23
chandler,"Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.",9,23
monica,"Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?",9,23
chandler,"I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?",9,23
monica,"They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.",9,23
chandler,"Man, that is some bad advice!",9,23
joey,Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!,9,23
rachel,Hey! Hey what's going on?,9,23
joey,"Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!",9,23
rachel,"Alright, I don't want to alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!",9,23
monica,"Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!",9,23
chandler,that is why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!,9,23
joey,"Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in",9,23
monica,"Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!",9,23
phoebe,"Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!",9,23
monica,And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .,9,23
rachel,"Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. that is all, I just wish I could  share that with a guy.",9,23
phoebe,Not Joey.,9,23
rachel,"Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.",9,23
monica,"Yeah, right!",9,23
david,"So, ehm... I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.",9,23
chandler,"Tonight?!  Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  Oh, there it is!",9,23
david,"Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. that is uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.",9,23
chandler,Nice!,9,23
chandler,"Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?",9,23
monica,Ok!,9,23
chandler,David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!,9,23
monica,See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?,9,23
chandler,That would be advice!!,9,23
monica,Ok fine. I'll handle this.  Phoebe?,9,23
phoebe,Yeah?,9,23
monica,I need to talk to you.,9,23
phoebe,"Are you leaving ""The Supremes""?",9,23
monica,"Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.",9,23
phoebe,Wow? Really? that is fantastic!,9,23
monica,What are you serious? You want to marry him? Wha... What about Mike?,9,23
phoebe,"Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it",9,23
monica,Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?,9,23
phoebe,"Sure! Look, ok, bottom line",9,23
ross,"By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.",9,23
charlie,It's great. you are going to be the hit of the conference.,9,23
ross,"Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .",9,23
joey,Hey guys!,9,23
ross,The chocolates aren't here yet.,9,23
joey,Damnit!,9,23
charlie,Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!,9,23
chandler,"Oh, is it on the computer, because I'd love to give it a read...?",9,23
ross,"If you want to check your email, just ask!",9,23
chandler,What?  May I?,9,23
rachel,"What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.",9,23
charlie,Actually the wet season is June to December.,9,23
rachel,It's not the time Charlie.,9,23
chandler,"Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!",9,23
joey,"Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  Oh! Secret teapot?",9,23
chandler,"Your computer, I don't know what... everything's gone!",9,23
ross,Wha... what do you mean?,9,23
chandler,It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.,9,23
ross,"What, oh my God. What did you do?",9,23
chandler,Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.,9,23
ross,"Why, why would you open it?",9,23
chandler,"Well, it didn't say ""This is a virus""!!",9,23
ross,What did it say?,9,23
chandler,Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.,9,23
ross,"What... what am I going to do? My speech is gone, Chandler!",9,23
chandler,"It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?",9,23
ross,NO! I don't!!,9,23
chandler,"Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!",9,23
joey,It's really gone?,9,23
ross,Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!,9,23
chandler,I just feel awful.,9,23
ross,"Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!",9,23
chandler,"Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same ""I'm going to kill you"" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...",9,23
ross,Get out!,9,23
rachel,"You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.",9,23
ross,"Well, what do you do?",9,23
rachel,"Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.",9,23
ross,I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I going to say?,9,23
joey,I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.,9,23
ross,"I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is going to help me right now, Joe!",9,23
charlie,"Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!",9,23
ross,Wha... what you really think we can do that?,9,23
charlie,"Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner .",9,23
joey,"Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.",9,23
rachel,Ugh.,9,23
ross,"Alright, ok, let's do it.  Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello!  And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.",9,23
joey,"Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a ""Galaxy far, far away""? .",9,23
mike,Hello?,9,23
monica,"Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""I never want to get married"" thing and step up!",9,23
mike,Who is this?,9,23
monica,"This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but I know she really wants to be with you!",9,23
mike,He... he's going to propose?,9,23
monica,"I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!",9,23
mike,"Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not going to stand in the way of that and neither should you.",9,23
monica,"You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity?  Damnit!",9,23
monica,"Well, I hope you are happy!",9,23
chandler,"Ooh! I hope you are happy too, honey!",9,23
monica,"Phoebe is going to say ""Yes"" to David. See, that is what happens when you meddle in people's lives!",9,23
chandler,"Phoebe is going to say ""yes""? that is, that is great!",9,23
monica,"No it's not, because she's still in love with Mike!",9,23
chandler,And there's not chance that will work?,9,23
monica,"No, I called him. It's not going to happen.",9,23
chandler,Ooh! Meddler! Meddler!,9,23
monica,"Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!",9,23
chandler,This vacation sucks!!,9,23
joey,"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.",9,23
rachel,"Well, I've brought some books. We could read.",9,23
joey,"Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.",9,23
joey,Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!,9,23
waiter,"I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention",9,23
joey,"Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?",9,23
rachel,We can't. We're not pharmacists!,9,23
joey,"I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...",9,23
rachel,Kate Miller?,9,23
joey,Kate Miller it is.,9,23
rachel,And... that is the most sex I'm going to have this weekend.,9,23
joey,In that case should I make sure it's on real good?,9,23
rachel,Thank you.,9,23
charlie,"And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.",9,23
ross,"Yeah, that is it?",9,23
charlie,Yeah.,9,23
ross,"Oh my God, we did it!",9,23
charlie,Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.,9,23
ross,"Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much.  that is a pretty necklace.",9,23
charlie,Thank you.,9,23
ross,"Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?",9,23
charlie,"Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.",9,23
ross,"Oh my God, I love you.",9,23
charlie,"Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?",9,23
ross,"that is Ben, my son from my first marriage.",9,23
charlie,Your first marriage?,9,23
ross,Yeah.,9,23
charlie,you are married more than once?,9,23
ross,No.,9,23
charlie,"So, why did you break up?",9,23
ross,"Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.",9,23
charlie,"Oh my God, this is so cool!",9,23
ross,"Ok, odd thing to get excited about!",9,23
charlie,"No, it's just... I was engaged to a guy who turned out to be gay!",9,23
ross,Hey! High-five!,9,23
charlie,Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiance was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.,9,23
ross,My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.,9,23
charlie,Right and then everybody finds out and they're like,9,23
ross,"I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note",9,23
charlie,I know!,9,23
ross,"And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?",9,23
charlie,I didn't do that.,9,23
ross,Me neither.,9,23
joey,"Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.",9,23
rachel,"I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.",9,23
joey,"Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you are the single one, seen anybody in there you like?",9,23
rachel,"Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...",9,23
joey,"But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?",9,23
rachel,No.,9,23
joey,"There it is, you are blushing!",9,23
rachel,"No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.",9,23
joey,You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?,9,23
rachel,No.,9,23
joey,Tell me who it is.,9,23
rachel,Joey!,9,23
joey,"Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. you are not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?",9,23
rachel,"Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's going to happen.",9,23
joey,"What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?",9,23
rachel,"Oh!  Ok. Ok, you really want to know who it is?",9,23
joey,"Yeah, who is that?",9,23
rachel,Do you?,9,23
joey,Yeah.,9,23
ross and charlie,Hey!,9,23
charlie,"I just left you a message! Ross and I were going to go grab a bite, but now that you are here, maybe we can go have that dinner.",9,23
joey,"Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?",9,23
ross,"Yep, we got it, we got it.  Thank you so much.",9,23
charlie,I had a great time.,9,23
joey,"Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really want to know who...",9,23
rachel,Later! La...,9,23
charlie,"So, shall we?",9,23
joey,Yeah.,9,23
rachel,"Ok. See you, bye.",9,23
charlie,Bye.,9,23
ross,Good night.,9,23
joey,Night.,9,23
ross and rachel,"Ok, good night!",9,23
monica,I can't believe she's going to say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.,9,23
chandler,"You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.",9,23
david,"Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I want to say.",9,23
monica,"Oh my God, he's going to do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.",9,23
chandler,"I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  ""Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..."" Spit it out, David!",9,23
david,"Uh, Phoebe, uh...  you are an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!",9,23
phoebe,"Sure, ok, yeah.",9,23
david,"But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end...",9,23
phoebe,"Oh my God, Mike!",9,23
david,"It's David, actually!",9,23
phoebe,"No, Mike's here.",9,23
david,Hi Mike!,9,23
mike,Hi David. Chandler. Monica...  Oh!,9,23
monica,IT'S THE HUMIDITY!,9,23
mike,Hi Phoebe.,9,23
phoebe,"What are you, what are you doing here?",9,23
mike,I have a question I need to ask you.,9,23
david,I have a question I was kind of going to ask her myself.,9,23
mike,"Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.",9,23
david,"Ok, would you care for my seat as well?",9,23
mike,"Actually yeah, that'll be great.",9,23
david,"that is fair, you've had a long trip.",9,23
mike,"Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.",9,23
david,kind of stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.,9,23
mike,"Sorry David, but she really has to know this.",9,23
david,"Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.",9,23
monica,"you are the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...",9,23
david,I have a ring.,9,23
chandler,"I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.",9,23
david,"Phoebe, will you marry me?",9,23
phoebe,No!,9,23
david,Uhm... Ha ha!,9,23
phoebe,"I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.",9,23
mike,We can have any future you want.,9,23
david,"Ok, I'm going to take off.",9,23
phoebe,"David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.",9,23
david,"Just so I know, if I had asked first...",9,23
phoebe,"Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.",9,23
david,"Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip!",9,23
mike,Is it ok if I hug you now?,9,23
phoebe,Yes!,9,23
monica,BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?,9,23
chandler,"Oh, isn't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.",9,23
monica,I know,9,23
rachel,Open your drapes! Open your drapes!,9,23
chandler,I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!,9,23
monica,The sun is out!,9,23
chandler,Hey! Remember when I had corneas?,9,23
monica,"Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.",9,23
chandler,Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.,9,23
rachel,No!,9,23
monica,Damn it!,9,23
ross,"Walls are pretty thin, guys!",9,23
ross,Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.,9,23
rachel,"Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!",9,23
ross,"Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered",9,23
chandler,Not to mention the cold sores.,9,23
ross,"And that is just the herbivores. I'm not even going to discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.",9,23
chandler,Really?,9,23
ross,"But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...",9,23
charlie,What?,9,23
joey,"He said ""erectus""!",9,23
charlie,"you are... you are kidding, right?",9,23
joey,"No, he really said it.",9,23
ross,... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...,9,23
joey,Erectus?,9,23
rachel,Homo.,9,23
ross,... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.  Thank you!,9,23
ross,"Oh, thanks guys!",9,23
man with a bow tie,I thought... it was wonderful!,9,23
ross,Oh!,9,23
man with a bow tie,"Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell.  I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... .",9,23
ross,Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!,9,23
rachel,"All right! Well, uh...  we're going to hit the beach?",9,23
monica,Yeah!,9,23
rachel,It was really... great!,9,23
ross,"Oh, thank you so much!",9,23
joey,"Yeah, and so funny!",9,23
rachel,Oh!,9,23
ross,"Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys!  Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!",9,23
mike,"you are kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!",9,23
mike,Oh... I'm back!,9,23
ross,Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?,9,23
phoebe & mike,Yeah!,9,23
ross,Hey!  Well...?,9,23
charlie,You were incredible!,9,23
ross,Yeah?,9,23
charlie,You blew them away!,9,23
ross,"Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?",9,23
charlie,I was not!,9,23
ross,"No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!",9,23
charlie,Oh my God!  I'm your groupie!,9,23
ross,I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!,9,23
ross,"Look, I took it too far!",9,23
monica,"I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!",9,23
phoebe,"Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these palaeontologists with their shirts off.  Not you guys. You got it going on!",9,23
monica,"So, what are we going to do today?",9,23
mike,They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.,9,23
monica,"Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!",9,23
chandler,I don't think so!,9,23
monica,Why not?,9,23
chandler,"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!",9,23
monica,I'm not always that bad!,9,23
chandler,"Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?",9,23
monica,I punched you...?,9,23
chandler,And...?,9,23
monica,... Phoebe...?,9,23
phoebe,... and...?,9,23
monica,I clunked your heads together!,9,23
charlie,Hey! There you are!,9,23
joey,"Hey!  As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkelling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases you!",9,23
charlie,"I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.",9,23
joey,"Oh... oh, but that is ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...",9,23
charlie,You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and  especially last night...,9,23
joey,"Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech...",9,23
charlie,"Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!",9,23
joey,"Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!",9,23
charlie,Yeah...,9,23
charlie,... is it weird that it's not with each other?,9,23
joey,"Yeah! A little bit, yeah...",9,23
charlie,I think we need to talk...!,9,23
joey,Yeah... I think we do... ... about what?,9,23
monica,"C'mon guys, it'll be fun!",9,23
phoebe,"All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!",9,23
monica,But then how do we know who wins?,9,23
phoebe,Nobody wins!,9,23
monica,"So, we're just four losers... SUPER!",9,23
chandler,I'm not playing with you.,9,23
phoebe,"Yeah, I'm out.",9,23
mike,I'll play you!,9,23
monica,OK!,9,23
phoebe,"Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you are doing!",9,23
chandler,She gets crazy! This scar  is from Pictionary!,9,23
mike,I think I will be all right!  You want to volley a bit for a serve?,9,23
monica,Sure! Got to!,9,23
monica,Aww!,9,23
mike,"Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!",9,23
chandler,"Oh dear God, there's two of them!",9,23
mike,you are ready to play?,9,23
monica,"Hell, yeah!",9,23
chandler,Did you know this about him?,9,23
phoebe,No idea! I though he was soft like you!,9,23
mike,want to make it more interesting?,9,23
monica,How much were you thinking?,9,23
mike,Ten bucks a game?,9,23
monica,Make it fifty!,9,23
mike,I'll make it a hundred!,9,23
monica,One thousand...,9,23
chandler,OK!,9,23
mike,"To see who goes first, you got a quarter?",9,23
monica,No...  Either of you girls got a quarter?,9,23
chandler,"Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!",9,23
phoebe,"Monica, you call it.",9,23
monica,"Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!",9,23
phoebe,Tails!,9,23
monica,"Ow, what are the chances!",9,23
monica,Ha! My point!,9,23
mike,"Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.",9,23
phoebe,He was a lawyer!,9,23
alexandra steele,"... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!",9,23
rachel,Oh! Weather bitch!,9,23
rachel,"It's open!  Hi, Joe!",9,23
joey,Hey...,9,23
rachel,"What, is everything ok?",9,23
joey,Uh... Charlie and I broke up.,9,23
rachel,"No, why?",9,23
joey,"Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.",9,23
rachel,"Oh, that is crazy!",9,23
joey,"No, it's not, we have nothing in common!",9,23
rachel,"... yeah, it's true.",9,23
joey,"I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!",9,23
rachel,"What, hey!",9,23
joey,"Ok, Rach!",9,23
joey,"I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?",9,23
rachel,"W-What are you, what are you talking about?",9,23
joey,"Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like...  What the hell is my problem? OH!",9,23
rachel,Ok... uh... maybe you are not always going after the wrong girl...,9,23
joey,"I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!",9,23
rachel,"Yeah, I'm not talking about her...",9,23
joey,But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?,9,23
rachel,You know? Forget it!,9,23
joey,"No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?",9,23
rachel,"No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!",9,23
joey,"Ok! All right, well... I'm going to see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!",9,23
rachel,"Yeah, sure!",9,23
joey,You like me?,9,23
rachel,"Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!",9,23
joey,that is a huge thing!,9,23
rachel,"Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing",9,23
joey,What... for how long?,9,23
rachel,Only like a month!,9,23
joey,A MONTH??,9,23
rachel,"What the... DIAL IT DOWN!  Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us!  Ok, dial it up a little!",9,23
joey,I just have one question!,9,23
rachel,Shoot!,9,23
joey,What the hell are you doin'???,9,23
rachel,"I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious...  what that would be like?...",9,23
joey,"Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!",9,23
rachel,Who...?,9,23
joey,"CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!",9,23
rachel,"Oh yes, of course, I remember him!",9,23
joey,"Yeah, he had a paper route.",9,23
rachel,"Yeah, he did!  Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!",9,23
joey,"No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!",9,23
rachel,But can it... just... happen a little bit?,9,23
joey,"NO, NO! It can't happen at all!",9,23
rachel,"But why, why not?",9,23
joey,"Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?  I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no!  I couldn't do it to Ross!",9,23
rachel,But that wasn't going to stop you before!,9,23
joey,"I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right...  I'm sorry...!",9,23

rachel,"Ok, I...",9,23
rachel,AAAHHHH!,9,23
monica,"Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!",9,23
mike,Do you?,9,23
monica,"Ah, yeah!",9,23
mike,Do you?,9,23
monica,"Ah, yeah!",9,23
mike,DO YOU?,9,23
monica,AH YEAAAAH!,9,23
chandler,Do you really find this attractive on him?,9,23
phoebe,"Oh, yeah!  Are you telling me you... you are not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?",9,23
chandler,I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.,9,23
phoebe,"C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!",9,23
monica,"Oh, damn it!",9,23
phoebe,I sleep with him!,9,23
mike,"Game, point!",9,23
monica,"Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?",9,23
mike,"You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.",9,23
monica,"NO, NO, NOOO!",9,23
mike,And that is how it's done!,9,23
chandler,"Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.",9,23
monica,Best out of three?,9,23
mike,that is what I'm thinking.,9,23
chandler,Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?,9,23
monica,"Serve the ball, chump!",9,23
mike,,9,23
phoebe,"Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.",9,23
mr. oberblau,"I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be  just nifty!",9,23
ross,"Ooh, well. Ah, I kind of have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.",9,23
woman,Jarvis?,9,23
mr. oberblau,"Oh, you are back...  this is my wife, Nancy.",9,23
ross,Get Out!,9,23
charlie,"Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?",9,23
ross,"Yes, please!  So, what's going on?",9,23
charlie,"Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.",9,23
ross,"Oh my God, wh-what happened?",9,23
charlie,"Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!",9,23
ross,I knew that was him!,9,23
charlie,"Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.",9,23
ross,"Hey, you ok?",9,23
charlie,I guess. There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.,9,23
paleontologist,"Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.",9,23
ross,"Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.",9,23
charlie,"Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?",9,23
professore clerk,Or we could throw you both in now!,9,23
ross,"Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. . GO, GO, GO!",9,23
mike,"Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.",9,23
chandler,"Ok, look! Enough is enough!",9,23
monica,"No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!",9,23
chandler,"Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!",9,23
monica,I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!,9,23
chandler,But...,9,23
monica,"Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!",9,23
chandler,What about the obsessive cleaning?,9,23
monica,that is just good sense!,9,23
monica,Aww!,9,23
chandler,You ok?,9,23
monica,"No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off!  Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh!  Oh my God! I can't play!",9,23

chandler,"No, you didn't.",9,23
monica,What?,9,23
chandler,Because I'm going to play for you.,9,23
phoebe,You can't do that!,9,23
mike,"Oh, that is ok. I don't care which of them I beat.",9,23
phoebe,"Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.",9,23
monica,"Honey, you don't have to do this.",9,23
chandler,"Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.",9,23
monica,But... you suck!,9,23
chandler,"you are welcome, sweetheart.",9,23
chandler,"All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.",9,23
mike,Ok!,9,23
monica,Oh my God! you are good!,9,23
phoebe,It's like watching porn!,9,23
chandler,And that is... how... it's done!,9,23
monica,Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you  Hold on! I almost forgot  loser!  When did you stop sucking?,9,23
chandler,"I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!",9,23
monica,Why?,9,23
chandler,I don't know.,9,23
monica,This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!,9,23
chandler,that is why!,9,23
charlie,Thanks!,9,23
ross,Hi.,9,23
charlie,Are they still looking for us?,9,23
ross,"Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.  You know, we as a group are not the coolest.",9,23
ross,I don't think they saw us.,9,23
charlie,I don't think they did.,9,23
charlie,"Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum...  There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.",9,23
ross,Oh. Can I... can I ask who?,9,23
charlie,I think you know.,9,23
ross,"I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...",9,23
ross,I'm sorry... we... we can't.,9,23
charlie,"All right, all right.",9,23
ross,"I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea.  Or-or not!",9,23
rachel,What?,9,23
monica,"Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such   a turn-on. You want to...?",10,1
chandler,"You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.",10,1
monica,I'll put a pillowcase over my head.,10,1
chandler,you are on!,10,1
phoebe,Hey!,10,1
monica,What's up?,10,1
phoebe,"Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the   way there's  no law against. And then we're going to grab some food, so if you   want...",10,1
ross,... finally...,10,1
phoebe,Is that Ross?,10,1
monica,"Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid   walls.",10,1
phoebe,Sounds like he's with someone.,10,1
chandler,"He could be alone. This morning I heard him do   push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.",10,1
monica,"Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I   hear someone else in there with him.",10,1
charlie,Ooh... Dr. Geller!,10,1
ross,"God, you are amazing... I didn't even have to ask you   to call me that.",10,1
monica,"Oh my God, that is Charlie!",10,1
chandler,She's cheating on Joey with Ross!,10,1
phoebe,Oh that tart... floozy... giant...,10,1
monica,I'm not sure about this.,10,1
phoebe,"Yeah, you are right. This is none of our business.",10,1
monica,No I'm not sure that it's  the best way to hear   everything. Someone get me a glass!,10,1
phoebe,"Oh, I'm not going to do this, okay? I'm not going to eavesdrop   on my friend.",10,1
rachel,Ooh... I love Barbados!,10,1
joey,Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm     kissing Rachel!,10,1
rachel,"I know, I'm her!",10,1
phoebe,Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!,10,1
monica,What?,10,1
phoebe,Get over here!,10,1
rachel,ooh...,10,1
chandler,Wow!,10,1
monica,"Oh my God,   I love how thin these walls are!",10,1
monica,Thank you.,10,1
rachel,"Hey, you know, before you said     that nothing could happen between us? What changed?",10,1
joey,"Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then   I saw him kissing Charlie...",10,1
rachel,"What? Ross and Charlie?  Wow! She's really   making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?",10,1
monica,I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?,10,1
chandler,How about the dinosaur twins in the other room?   No-one is manning that wall!,10,1
monica,I'm on it!,10,1
chandler,Anything?,10,1
monica,I think I hear curtains closing...,10,1
phoebe,We've got shoes being kicked off over here.,10,1
monica,"Bedsprings, unmistakable!",10,1
chandler,You do realise  that is your brother?,10,1
monica,"Not until you said it. Somebody switch!  Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey   and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people  leaving with the   same person we came with.",10,1
chandler,that is not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving   with Weird Al.,10,1
monica,"Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning,   before we leave, I'm going to the salon.",10,1
chandler,Okay Buckwheat!,10,1
phoebe,"You got to hear this, it's great... It's like free   porn!",10,1
ross,Weh...*sigh*,10,1
charlie,uhm... Is everything okay?,10,1
ross,"Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...",10,1
charlie,"Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread,   because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could   just...",10,1
ross,"No, NO!  Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up.   Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.",10,1
charlie,I uhm... I completely understand.,10,1
ross,"Alright, I'm going to go find them...  I just need a... need a before I can... you know.  Grandma... grandma... grandma...  Okay, I see you later.",10,1
charlie,Okay...,10,1
phoebe,that is the door. He's gone...,10,1
chandler,And she's... turning on the TV... and watching...   Miss Congeniality!,10,1
monica,"Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it   too well!",10,1
ross,"Hey, what are you guys doing?",10,1
phoebe,"Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying   goodbye to the hotel.  I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort   and Spa...",10,1
monica,"Yeah, we had a great time, thank   you!",10,1
chandler,Bye!,10,1
ross,"Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?",10,1
chandler,He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend   Charlie. that is the situation as we know it...,10,1
ross,"Well, if you see him could you please tell   him I'm looking for him?",10,1
chandler,You got it!,10,1
ross,Thanks!  Thank you!,10,1
monica,"Other wall, people! Other wall!",10,1
ross,"Rach,  you there?",10,1
joey,"Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we going to do?",10,1
rachel,"Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he   knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant.  that is not nonchalant!",10,1
joey,No idea what it means.,10,1
rachel,"Oh... okay, just hide!",10,1
ross,Rach?,10,1
rachel,"Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!",10,1
rachel,There's no room under the bed.,10,1
ross,Is everything okay?,10,1
rachel,Yeah...,10,1
ross,Hey.,10,1
rachel,Hi...,10,1
ross,You know where Joey is?,10,1
rachel,...I really don't...,10,1
ross,Can I talk to you for a minute?,10,1
rachel,"Yeah, sure...",10,1
joey,I don't believe this... Have you guys been...,10,1
phoebe,Shh... This is the listening side of the   wall.,10,1
ross,"And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up,   and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.",10,1
rachel,Uh-huh... right... yeah...,10,1
ross,And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the   day I met her.,10,1
rachel,"Oh, I know... I know it's been   really hard for you.",10,1
ross,"Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before   you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is going to   be?",10,1
rachel,"That is hard to say,   Ross. That is hard to say.",10,1
ross,"You know, I got to go find him. He's got to be here someplace.",10,1
rachel,You would think!,10,1
rachel,Joey!,10,1
joey,Is he gone?,10,1
rachel,How are you doing this?,10,1
joey,Pssst...,10,1
rachel,How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this?   Have you guys been listening this entire time?,10,1
"monica, chandler and phoebe",YE-AH!,10,1
phoebe,"Now, what is this?",10,1
rachel,"Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten   minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth   grade!",10,1
phoebe,Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated   this could get? What about Ross?,10,1
joey,"Well, he's with Charlie now.",10,1
monica,"Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything   really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think   he deserves the same from you?",10,1
joey,"you are a pain in   my ass, Geller!",10,1
rachel,"All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all   the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...",10,1
chandler,"Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you   do one thing for us? The people that  care about you?",10,1
rachel,Sure...,10,1
chandler,Enunciate!,10,1
rachel,Get out!,10,1
rachel,Are they right?,10,1
joey,"Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off   until we talk to Ross.",10,1
rachel,"Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have   to do anything tonight.",10,1
joey,"Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm going to...   I'm going to take off...",10,1
rachel,Although...,10,1
joey,I like although!,10,1
rachel,"I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like...   six years...",10,1
joey,Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as high school...,10,1
rachel,"Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.",10,1
joey,Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.,10,1
rachel,No...,10,1
joey,I'm thinking about you...,10,1
rachel,Yeah...,10,1
joey,Let's forget about Ross...,10,1
rachel,Forgotten.,10,1
joey,What's wrong?,10,1
rachel,Nothing...,10,1
joey,Seriously... What is it?,10,1
rachel,"Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here,   come here...",10,1
joey,What's wrong?,10,1
rachel,"Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out   of my head...",10,1
joey,"Well, maybe I can help.",10,1
rachel,"Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do   that again...",10,1
joey,Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...,10,1
both,Yeah,10,1
ross,Hey!,10,1
chandler,Hey!,10,1
ross,You guys ready to go?,10,1
chandler,"Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm   just finishing packing.",10,1
ross,Dude! you are not taking your Bible?,10,1
chandler,"you are not supposed to take that. Besides, it's   a New Testament, what are you going to do with it?",10,1
ross,Learn about Jesus...,10,1
ross,Hey!,10,1
charlie,"So, did you talk to Joey?",10,1
ross,"Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just going to talk   to him on the plane.",10,1
charlie,"Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!",10,1
ross,Stop it!,10,1
charlie,PHD,10,1
ross,you are filthy!,10,1
phoebe,"Hey, have you guys seen Monica?",10,1
ross,"Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.",10,1
phoebe,"Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...",10,1
monica,Check it out!,10,1
phoebe,Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!,10,1
chandler,Hey!... ah!,10,1
monica,What do you think?,10,1
chandler,I think.... I think I can see your scalp.,10,1
monica,Don't you just love it?,10,1
ross,Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.,10,1
charlie,It's so... something... You go girlfriend!,10,1
ross,"You've never said that in your life, have you?",10,1
charlie,Not once.,10,1
ross,I thought so.,10,1
monica,And listen to this...,10,1
chandler,What did you know... It's a treat for the eyes and the   ears.,10,1
joey,"Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kind of weird that I'm sitting   next to Charlie after we broke up.",10,1
chandler,"Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care   about your social life.",10,1
joey,"Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?",10,1
ross,"Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference   with Charlie.",10,1
joey,I understand...,10,1
ross,"No, I'll do it.",10,1
chandler,Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't   want to sit with Allen Iverson over there.,10,1
phoebe,"Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain   turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...",10,1
mike,"You should be careful when checking your overhead bins,  Because items may shift during...",10,1
phoebe,Ah... you are not good at this...,10,1
mike,"You don't have to go home tonight, do you?",10,1
phoebe,"No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?",10,1
mike,Oh...,10,1
phoebe,What?,10,1
mike,Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.,10,1
phoebe,Why not?,10,1
mike,I have a date.,10,1
phoebe,You have a... You have a date? With who?,10,1
mike,"Oh, it's... my girlfriend.",10,1
phoebe,You have...  have a girlfriend?,10,1
mike,"Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started   seeing someone.",10,1
phoebe,For how long?,10,1
mike,Three months.,10,1
phoebe,"Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my   business, but uhm, how long do you think you are going to keep seeing her?",10,1
mike,I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I   promise.,10,1
phoebe,"Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you   get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.",10,1
mike,Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the   packing material...,10,1
phoebe,"You know what, we're going to have sex. Let's just leave   it there.",10,1
ross,"Right, I'm going to go talk to Joey. I think this is the   right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says ""duty   free"".",10,1
charlie,Okay... Good luck.,10,1
rachel,Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really   good time to talk to him.,10,1
joey,I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.,10,1
rachel,"Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you are done,   they'll probably be serving dinner.",10,1
joey,Ooh...,10,1
rachel,Still nervous?,10,1
joey,I'm going to get the lasagna.,10,1
ross,Hey Rach...,10,1
rachel,Yeah!,10,1
ross,Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?,10,1
rachel,"Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!",10,1
ross,Hey!,10,1
joey,Hey!,10,1
ross,"So, I uhm... kind of need to talk to you about Charlie.",10,1
joey,Yeah?,10,1
ross,"Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry   to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...,   well...",10,1
joey,You kissed.,10,1
ross,Wha...  What? What would give you that idea?,10,1
joey,I saw you.,10,1
ross,"Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else   happened, okay.",10,1
joey,"Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.",10,1
ross,What?,10,1
joey,"It's okay. You know, I totally understand,   alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And...   I want you to be happy.",10,1
ross,Are you serious?,10,1
joey,Yeah... Now I have something...,10,1
ross,"I am speechless... I mean the fact that you would put   my happiness first like that. I mean, you are an incredible friend, you know   that?",10,1
joey,Oh... uh...  look... before you...,10,1
ross,"No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless,   and generous...",10,1
joey,"I am those things, yeah.",10,1
ross,"You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always   think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some   stuff...",10,1
joey,Dude!,10,1
ross,"Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...",10,1
joey,I can't think of anything.,10,1
ross,Thanks!,10,1
joey,Yeah.,10,1
rachel,So hi!,10,1
ross,Hi!,10,1
rachel,"So you eh, you talked to Joey?",10,1
ross,"Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.",10,1
rachel,Oh! that is great!,10,1
ross,Yeah!,10,1
rachel,"Oh, so everything's okay?",10,1
ross,"Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing   guy.",10,1
rachel,"Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.",10,1
ross,"Well, I'm so excited about this.",10,1
rachel,Really? Excited?,10,1
ross,Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams   about this...,10,1
rachel,"Excuse me!  You didn't tell him, did you?",10,1
joey,I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things   about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take them all back. I'm on a edge   on Chandler.,10,1
rachel,"Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget   it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.",10,1
joey,"Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.",10,1
phoebe,"Hi, Mike's place.",10,1
mike,"Hey, it's Mike.",10,1
phoebe,"Ooh, that was fast.",10,1
mike,"Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think   I'm just going to take off and break up with her over the phone...",10,1
phoebe,"Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap   on a pair. Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know,   women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while.   Just F.Y.I.",10,1
mike,One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious   on my coffee table.,10,1
phoebe,Her name is Precious? Is she a pure breed or did you   pick her up at the pound?,10,1
mike,"Anyway, I just want to give you a heads up.",10,1
phoebe,"Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch   her tummy and give her a liver snout.",10,1
precious,"Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?",10,1
phoebe,I... I'm Phoebe.,10,1
precious,"Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of   his life? That Phoebe?",10,1
phoebe,Enchante,10,1
monica,"Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...    Ow!",10,1
chandler,"You go back to work tomorrow night, right?",10,1
monica,Yeah!,10,1
chandler,"So if you want people to see them, then by definition   you are not  having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?",10,1
monica,"Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be   able to do this.  You like that, right?",10,1
chandler,What are you singing?,10,1
monica,"It's ""Bolero"" from ""10"".",10,1
chandler,"It's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from ""Apocalypse   Now""...   See, here's the thing",10,1
monica,You what? You said you liked them.,10,1
chandler,Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was   that I could see your scalp.,10,1
monica,"Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.",10,1
chandler,"Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel   said, was  she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey...   Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.",10,1
monica,"You know what? I don't care. I like it like this,   and I'm going to keep it. you are just jealous because your hair can't do this...    OUCH!",10,1
chandler,Hit yourself in the tooth?,10,1
monica,And the eye!,10,1
ross,"Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed   you.  Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have   a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants   again to use as a rattle?",10,1
rachel,"That was one time, Ross, and they were only like   5 milligrams.",10,1
ross,"Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay?   Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.",10,1
rachel,"Ah... Ross, actually there's something that I really   need to talk to you about.",10,1
ross,"Okay, shoot!",10,1
rachel,"Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.",10,1
ross,OH NO!,10,1
rachel,What? What is it?,10,1
ross,"Oh, major shampoo explosion!",10,1
rachel,"Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.",10,1
ross,"Oh, it's all over everything. Why?   Why me?",10,1
rachel,Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?,10,1
ross,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?",10,1
rachel,"Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...",10,1
ross,"Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser.   It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?",10,1
rachel,"Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.",10,1
ross,"Duh, you think?",10,1
phoebe,"Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See,   you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at   the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong.   Point is... I'm going to take off.",10,1
precious,"I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's   going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?",10,1
phoebe,"Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?",10,1
precious,My name is Precious.,10,1
phoebe,"Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm going to be   straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately   that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about   that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.",10,1
precious,I just can't believe this... Why?,10,1
phoebe,"Well, I don't...",10,1
precious,"Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong   with me?",10,1
phoebe,"Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.",10,1
precious,"I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?",10,1
phoebe,"Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have     some pride, for the love of God.",10,1
phoebe,"Okay, not a fan of the tough love.",10,1
precious,I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any   warning.,10,1
phoebe,"But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning   on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...",10,1
precious,He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday  ever.,10,1
phoebe,"Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this.   you are an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a   wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was going to   break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell,   but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.",10,1
precious,"Oh, my God, maybe you are right. Maybe I don't need   him. I deserve to be treated with respect.",10,1
precious,"Screw you, Mike. you are a coward and a bastard,   and I hope you rot in hell.",10,1
phoebe,you are welcome!,10,1
chandler,"Honey, you've been in there for a long time...   Is everything okay?",10,1
monica,Not really.,10,1
monica,I have a problem.,10,1
chandler,Really? What happened?,10,1
monica,"Well, I was dancing around, and singing ""No Woman,   No Cry"" and I got stuck.",10,1
chandler,You can't move at all?,10,1
monica,"Oh, well, I can move...",10,1
chandler,"If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?",10,1
monica,I guess so...,10,1
chandler,Some of these look a little   frayed.,10,1
monica,"Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.",10,1
joey,Hey!,10,1
rachel,Hi!,10,1
joey,"So, did you err... did you tell Ross?",10,1
rachel,"Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related   emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.",10,1
joey,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better   if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if   he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.",10,1
rachel,"Yeah, Because that is what we do.",10,1
joey,"Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how   about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.",10,1
rachel,"Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again   we can't...",10,1
joey,"I know, I know..., but that is okay. I mean, we can   control ourselves, we're not animals.",10,1
rachel,"No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that   means good night then?",10,1
joey,Yeah! Good night!,10,1
rachel,Goo--ood night!,10,1
joey,Good night!,10,1
rachel,"Seriously, good night!",10,1
joey,Stop saying good night.,10,1
rachel,Okay.,10,1
monica,Look what I found in the drawer...  And you said I'd never wear this...,10,1
chandler,"Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a   little something for me?",10,1
monica,"Sure, what do you have in mind?",10,1
chandler,I think you know.,10,1
monica,Really? I don't really feel like it.,10,1
chandler,This is what I want to do.,10,1
monica,"Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.",10,1
chandler,"She's an   FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.",10,1
joey,"Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see  that, but.. Let me explain, okay?",10,2
rachel,We weren't doing anything!,10,2
joey,"Rach, he just saw us.",10,2
rachel,Shh.,10,2
joey,"But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.",10,2
rachel,"No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.",10,2
joey,"Dude, chill!  Okay, we also kissed in  Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.",10,2
rachel,"Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.",10,2
joey,"Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it  ever happened, but..",10,2
rachel,"We feel so terrible about this, Ross.",10,2
joey,"Yeah, but it did happen, so...",10,2
joey,Ross?,10,2
rachel,Ross?  Can we just close the door?,10,2
rachel,"Ross, say something. Anything.",10,2
ross,So you two are..?,10,2
joey and rachel,Yeah.,10,2
ross,And have you .. ed?,10,2
joey,"No, no, no!",10,2
rachel,"No, no, no!",10,2
ross,"But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?",10,2
joey,Probably.,10,2
joey,"No, no!",10,2
rachel,"Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this.  You have every right to go nuts.",10,2
ross,I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?,10,2
rachel,"No, but you know what I mean.",10,2
ross,"Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.   I'm fine!",10,2
joey,Really?,10,2
ross,"Absolutely.  I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know  why   it's coming out all loud and squeaky, Because really,   I'm fine.   I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys  kissing. I mean, at first I was like..  But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.",10,2
joey,Ross..,10,2
ross,"It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what   we should do?",10,2
rachel,Calm ourselves?,10,2
ross,"No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.   I'll cook!!",10,2
joey,"Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?",10,2
ross,"Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if   someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!",10,2
joey,I do like fajitas.,10,2
monica,"God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's   inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways   to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.",10,2
chandler,There's a hair in my coffee.,10,2
phoebe,Hey guys!,10,2
monica,Hey.,10,2
phoebe,"Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., Because he's meeting me here with   the triplets.",10,2
chandler,"You know, it's funny. Every time you say ""triplets,"" I   immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.",10,2
monica,that is sweet. Drink your hair.,10,2
phoebe,"Hey, what's all this stuff?",10,2
monica,"Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.",10,2
phoebe,"Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!",10,2
monica,that is not really how it works.,10,2
phoebe,"Oh, how does it work?",10,2
monica,I don't know!,10,2
phoebe,"Well, if you are having a hard time, you should talk to my   friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help   you.",10,2
monica,"Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be   great?",10,2
frank jr.,"Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about.   When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.",10,2
frank jr.,that is not what we talked about!!,10,2
phoebe,Hey!,10,2
frank jr.,Hey.,10,2
phoebe,Good to see you.,10,2
frank jr.,"Good to see you, too.",10,2
monica,Hi Frank.,10,2
frank jr.,"Hi, how you doin'?",10,2
monica,"Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!",10,2
monica,Which one is which again?,10,2
frank jr.,"Oh, that is Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the   lady's purse. And that is Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that is   Leslie throwing bagels at him.",10,2
monica,"""Willing to adopt triplets?"" No!",10,2
joey,"Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that is   cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our   first date.",10,2
rachel,"Well, what would we be doing?",10,2
joey,"I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy   dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...",10,2
rachel,Feel me up?,10,2
joey,In a carriage!,10,2
joey,"Hey, Charlie!",10,2
rachel,Hey.,10,2
charlie,"Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?",10,2
rachel,"Oh, you bet.",10,2
joey,"So, did you bring a little something for Ross?",10,2
charlie,Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.,10,2
joey,"Oh. Oh, thanks.",10,2
charlie,"And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you   want.",10,2
joey,"Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..",10,2
ross,"I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie!  Hi Joey.    And.. Oh! you are going to have to introduce me to your new   girlfriend.  I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know.  Come, please come in. Come in.",10,2
rachel,"Okay, well, we brought you some wine.",10,2
ross,Oh! That is so thoughtful.  She's a keeper. And what   did you bring me?,10,2
joey,"Uh, actually, that is..",10,2
ross,"Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these   things!!",10,2
charlie,"Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...",10,2
ross,What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you?   You see? Who else is fine?,10,2
joey,"Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe   have a drink.",10,2
ross,You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm going to go make a   pitcher of Margaritas.,10,2
phoebe,"Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.",10,2
frank jr.,"Yeah, I really cherish these moments, Because before you   know it, they're going to be awake again.",10,2
phoebe,"Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.",10,2
frank jr.,Yeah.,10,2
phoebe,"Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest   thing..",10,2
frank jr.,I haven't slept in four years!,10,2
phoebe,"that is a, that is a long time.",10,2
frank jr.,"You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so   many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold   one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with   his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's   three of them, Phoebe, three!",10,2
phoebe,"Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out   of my area.",10,2
frank jr.,"Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it,   it's too horrible. No.",10,2
phoebe,What?,10,2
frank jr.,"No, I can't.",10,2
phoebe,"Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I   didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!",10,2
frank jr.,"Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking   that, you know, maybe you could take one.",10,2
phoebe,What?! You can't separate them! that is terrible. Which one?,10,2
monica,Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great   things about you guys.,10,2
colleen,"Oh, please, we're happy to help.",10,2
bill,We went through the same thing when we were adopting.,10,2
chandler,"So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this   room, huh?",10,2
chandler,"I mean, you have a lovely home.",10,2
monica,"Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.",10,2
colleen,"Well, actually, I think this might help.",10,2
colleen,It's pretty much all the information you need.,10,2
monica,Oh my god!,10,2
colleen,"Everything is broken down into categories, and then   cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms   in the back.",10,2
monica,Thank you.  I think I just had a tiny orgasm.,10,2
bill,"I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it.   Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.",10,2
chandler,that is great.  Can I see the book?,10,2
chandler,"You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?",10,2
monica,It's.. It's just so pretty and white.,10,2
colleen,"The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.",10,2
colleen,I would have told him to do it too.,10,2
monica,Can I adopt you?,10,2
chandler,"Hey, you must be Owen.",10,2
owen,Yeah.,10,2
chandler,"I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.",10,2
owen,You were?,10,2
chandler,"Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.",10,2
owen,Huh?,10,2
chandler,You know how to use a compass?,10,2
owen,I have a badge in it.,10,2
chandler,You do? that is fantastic!,10,2
owen,You want to see it?,10,2
chandler,"I'd love to, but I got to get back to talking to your   parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.",10,2
owen,What?!?,10,2
chandler,What?,10,2
owen,I'm adopted?,10,2
chandler,I got nothing.,10,2
ross,"The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second   batch is good.",10,2
rachel,"Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.",10,2
ross,"Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us.   Just hanging'.",10,2
joey,"Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas going to be ready?",10,2
ross,"I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us.   There's no weirdness, no tension.",10,2
rachel,No awareness.,10,2
ross,"We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh!   Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?",10,2
ross,My fajitas!!,10,2
rachel,"Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a   little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he   normally doesn't drink like this.",10,2
charlie,"Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging   alcoholic.",10,2
charlie,"Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?",10,2
ross,"Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!",10,2
rachel,"Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!",10,2
ross,That is going to hurt tomorrow!,10,2
phoebe,"Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me   taking one of your kids, can we?",10,2
frank jr.,"No, of course we're not.",10,2
phoebe,Insane.,10,2
frank jr.,I know.,10,2
phoebe,"Alice would never go for it, right?",10,2
frank jr.,"Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've   got her onboard.",10,2
phoebe,"Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know,   hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?",10,2
frank jr.,Huh.,10,2
phoebe,Frank Jr. Jr.?,10,2
frank jr.,"Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know,   he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.",10,2
phoebe,Uh-huh.,10,2
frank jr.,"What's green and says ""hey, I'm a frog""? A talking frog!    Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.",10,2
phoebe,"Well, alright, that is fine. What about Leslie?",10,2
frank jr.,"Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that   knows how to burp the alphabet.",10,2
phoebe,"Alright, so that leaves Chandler.",10,2
frank jr.,"Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my   little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's going to be a doctor or a   realtor..",10,2
phoebe,"Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.",10,2
frank jr.,"Oh, I think you are right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I   can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but   they're my babies.",10,2
phoebe,"I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You   know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You   name the day, and I'll be there.",10,2
frank jr.,How about tomorrow?,10,2
phoebe,"Well, that is not good. But you know, I can move some stuff   around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day   together.",10,2
frank jr.,You'd do that for us?,10,2
phoebe,Are you kidding? that is what sisters are for.,10,2
frank jr.,"Look at them! Aw. I love you so   much.  Oh crap, don't   wake up, don't wake up!",10,2
chandler,Where are Bill and Colleen?,10,2
monica,They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you   believe how nice they are?,10,2
chandler,We have to leave!!,10,2
monica,Why? What did you do in the bathroom?,10,2
chandler,"I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way,   and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may   have told him.",10,2
monica,"Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace   everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!",10,2
colleen,Hey.,10,2
bill,"Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the   sour worms. Those are for Owen.",10,2
colleen,"I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we   haven't told him he's adopted yet.",10,2
chandler,But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he   already knows?,10,2
owen,I'm adopted?!,10,2
chandler,See? Intuitive!,10,2
bill,What? Where did you hear that?,10,2
owen,He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.,10,2
chandler,Which technically now you should give back!,10,2
colleen,You told him he's adopted?,10,2
chandler,"I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or   something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the   door. ""Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa   is real.""",10,2
owen,He isn't?!,10,2
chandler,"We have to get out of here, baby!",10,2
ross,Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.,10,2
rachel,Ooy.,10,2
ross,"And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is   life without love?",10,2
rachel,"Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?",10,2
ross,"O is for ""oh, wow!"" The V is for this very surprising turn   of   events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely   normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might   get married and have children of your own.",10,2
joey,"Dude, are you okay?",10,2
ross,Totally.,10,2
rachel,"Ross, you don't seem okay.",10,2
ross,"I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of   entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.",10,2
charlie,"Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.",10,2
ross,No!,10,2
charlie,"I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but   this has been lovely.",10,2
ross,Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and   that you never really liked Rachel.,10,2
charlie,"you are on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?",10,2
ross,Okay.,10,2
charlie,Alright.,10,2
charlie,"God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..",10,2
rachel,"Oh, that is okay, girls tend not to like me.",10,2
charlie,Bye.,10,2
ross,"Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!",10,2
rachel,"You know what, Ross? I think we're going to take off too.",10,2
ross,"Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple   now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.",10,2
rachel,"No, no, it's just that it's getting late...",10,2
ross,"Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of   margaritas. It's all good.",10,2
ross,I don't even know what that is for.,10,2
joey,You know what? I think I'm going to stay here and make sure he's   okay.,10,2
rachel,"Yeah, that is probably a good idea.",10,2
joey,Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.,10,2
rachel,"Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever   going to be okay with this.",10,2
joey,"It doesn't look good, does it?",10,2
joey,Morning. Here you go.,10,2
ross,Thanks. Did you stay here all night?,10,2
joey,Yeah.,10,2
ross,So you took off my pants and shoes?,10,2

ross,What do you mean?,10,2

joey,"that is what I hear, yeah.",10,2
ross,"This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys   aren't going to be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is   this thing with you and Rachel?",10,2

joey,"Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you are not okay with it.",10,2
ross,"No, but I want to be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie,   right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't   see the dance, did she?",10,2

joey,"Well, I... I know exactly what I'm going to do!",10,3
chandler,Really? Like you have a routine?,10,3
joey,"No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different. You have   to appreciate their uniqueness.",10,3
chandler,Really?,10,3

phoebe,"Ugh, Let's just cut her out!",10,3
monica,What?,10,3
phoebe,Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and   dodge her 'till she gets the point!,10,3
monica,"Oh, I guess we could try that, but...   it seems so harsh!  Have you ever done that?",10,3
chandler,"No, had it done to me though. Feels good !",10,3
ross,"Well... I like how you look, what are you?",10,3
assistant,Puerto Rican.,10,3
ross,"Two, I think a two.",10,3
assistant,"You've got to face the red light.   When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes.   When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks   then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?",10,3
ross,"Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.",10,3
assistant,"Wow, you catch on quick.",10,3

joey,Ok.,10,3
joey,"Uh, was that good for you?",10,3
phoebe,"Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could   baby-sit again.",10,3
monica,It could be Amanda!,10,3
phoebe,"Oh, you are right! I was just kidding about   Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!",10,3
amanda,Hello Monica. It's Amanda calling again. I   am in the neighbourhood hoping I can pop by your flat!,10,3

phoebe,"Fine, fine! You would not hold up well   under torture!",10,3
monica,And you would?,10,3
phoebe,I did!,10,3
rachel,"Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it's just a   little weird, it's you, and it's me, it's just going to take some   getting used to.",10,3

rachel,Oh!,10,3
rachel,Ow!,10,3
joey,Sorry!,10,3
rachel,Well this is romantic!,10,3
joey,"I'm sorry!  This never happened to me   before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can   do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!   I blame your bra!",10,3
rachel,It's a standard issue bra clasp!,10,3
joey,Then I blame you! Yeah! that is right! You threw me   off with all your slapping!,10,3
rachel,"Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey,   but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take   off my bra?",10,3
joey,NAH! I don't have another level!!,10,3
ross,I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.,10,3
chandler,Was that place... The Sun?,10,3
ross,Oh! And it gets worse!,10,3
chandler,Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory   all by yourself!,10,3
monica,"How could you mess this up? It's   so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!",10,3
ross,How do you count to five?,10,3

chandler,You didn't like that?,10,3
rachel,"Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out   too! He couldn't even undo my bra!",10,3
monica,"Wow, really? One time he just looked   at my bra and it popped open.",10,3
rachel,"I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have   kissed before and that is been great! But this time it was leading somewhere   and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.",10,3
monica,"Well, you guys have been friends   forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was?   You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.",10,3
rachel,"Ok, that is true. that is true,   we can do this. you are right, you are right, we can do this. We're just going to   power through!",10,3

phoebe,Hey!,10,3
monica,Is Amanda here yet?,10,3
phoebe,No.,10,3
monica,"Oh good. Good, look   I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan.   Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.",10,3
phoebe,"Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both   out of here?",10,3
monica,"Well, what do you think of Mike   and Chandler being in a car accident?",10,3
phoebe,"Are you kidding, I love it!",10,3

monica,"Ehm, we were friends in 1992.",10,3
amanda,No I distinctly remember you were dodging   her  calls and trying to avoid seeing her.,10,3
monica,You were going to cut   me out?,10,3
phoebe,Well...kind of.,10,3
monica,Oh My God!,10,3
amanda,Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like   a perfect arse!,10,3
phoebe,"Yeah well, in America you are just an ""ass"".",10,3
monica,"Hello? Chandler,   what's wrong?  Oh my God, are you alright?    Yeah, I'll be right there.  I'm so sorry,   but Chandler was in a car accident.",10,3
phoebe,Oh my   God. Was Mike with him?,10,3

phoebe,"Oh Chandler! Thank God you are alive. Monica, can   I talk to you outside for a minute?",10,3
monica,I have nothing to say to   you.,10,3
amanda,"Wow,   my flat is twice this size!",10,3
phoebe,"Please, Monica? In the hall?",10,3
amanda,"Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look   positively ghastly.",10,3
chandler,"Well, aren't you a treat.",10,3
monica,"I can't believe you tried to cut   me out. Why Phoebe, why?",10,3
phoebe,"It was right after we were living together and you   were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and   shrill.",10,3
monica,I'm still all those things!,10,3
phoebe,you are also so generous and kind and scrappy!,10,3
monica,I am scrappy.,10,3
phoebe,"Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't   keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only   one who ever clawed her way back in.",10,3
monica,It's because I'm scrappy.,10,3
phoebe,"Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your   way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.",10,3
monica,I won't know what I would do without   you.,10,3
monica,"Well, I guess we should go back   in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.",10,3
phoebe,"Yeah, I guess you are right.",10,3
amanda,Can you believe it. I've never had any professional   dance training.,10,3
glenda,"Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the   booth, and...",10,3
ross,"I'm going to stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does   it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them   all on my back.",10,3
glenda,Okay...,10,3
ross,"Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one   is it?",10,3
ross,Which... which... which... Which one is it?,10,3
ross,OH! SON OF A BITCH!,10,3
rachel,What is the matter with us?,10,3
joey,"Well, I know what's the matter with me.",10,3
rachel,"No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed   to be this... difficult?",10,3
joey,I don't know.,10,3
chandler,"That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she   sure can dance... Hey!",10,3
rachel,"Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When   you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more   than that?",10,3
chandler,"kind of... you know, sneaking around, having to hide   from you guys...",10,3
rachel,"No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...",10,3
joey,"Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it   was... really wrong?",10,3
chandler,"Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt   like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.",10,3
chandler,"I can tell from your expressions that that is the   good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm going to go continue to... spread the   joy.",10,3
rachel,"Well, just because it happened that way for them   doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.",10,3
joey,"Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's   difficult doesn't mean that you quit.",10,3
rachel,"Right, totally.",10,3
joey,"Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...   do it.",10,3
rachel,"Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one   of those couples that never have sex.",10,3
joey,that is a... pla-an.,10,3
joey,Wow... I did not see this coming.,10,3
rachel,I know.  Joey,10,3
rachel,Hmmm... Me too...,10,3
rachel,I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?,10,3
joey,I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.,10,3
rachel,Aah... I bet you are right.,10,3
joey,So...,10,3
rachel,Yeah.,10,3
joey,I love you.,10,3
rachel,"Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.",10,3
joey,"Yeah, me too.",10,3
joey,"Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.",10,3
chandler,"Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.",10,3
ross,Go away! I don't want to see anybody.,10,3
chandler,"I know, I went to the tanning place and the same   thing happened to me. You have to let me in.",10,3
ross,Really? Did you count Mississipily?,10,3
ross,"Dude, you are not tanned.",10,3
chandler,"No, I just had to get a picture of this.",10,3
chandler,I see you later!,10,3
monica,Hey guys!,10,4
"ross, rachel and chandler",Hey!,10,4
chandler,"Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.",10,4
monica,That place in Vermont? You can  take   a hint!,10,4
rachel,"Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!",10,4
ross,Yeah!,10,4
rachel,We're having a party.,10,4
monica,"Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?",10,4
ross,No.,10,4
rachel,"No,    that day... that won't be her real birthday!",10,4
chandler,Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday    was!,10,4
ross,"C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.",10,4
monica,"Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away.    You know, to reconnect... emotionally.",10,4
chandler,There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...,10,4
rachel,"Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?",10,4
ross,"Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing    weird sex stuff to my little sister.",10,4
rachel,"And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can    we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!",10,4
monica,"All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.",10,4
chandler,"Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this    party...",10,4
monica,"Believe me, that is not why we won't    be doing that!",10,4
rachel,"You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would    hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure    map to help me find them all.",10,4
phoebe,"Ooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm...    when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood    to buy us food!",10,4
ross,Hey guys!,10,4
rachel and phoebe,Hi!,10,4
ross,"Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.",10,4
rachel,"Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma    and we'll give it to her when she is 18.",10,4
phoebe,"Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!",10,4
ross,Yeah!,10,4
phoebe,"Oh, just think... she's going to be watching that video on a TV that hasn't    even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And    they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant    people!",10,4
ross,"that is the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?",10,4
rachel,"Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.",10,4
ross,"Ah, and where is Joey?",10,4
rachel,I said it's still nap time.,10,4
ross,"Hey, there is uncle Joey!",10,4
joey,Hey!,10,4
ross,"Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!",10,4
joey,"18, uh?   Ross",10,4
joey,"What, what!? it's for her hot friends!",10,4
ross,When they see this you'll be 52!,10,4
joey,And starting to think about settling down!,10,4
rachel,"Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents    on?",10,4
joey,I'd love to! Yeah!   Joey,10,4
phoebe,Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.,10,4
joey,"Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?",10,4
phoebe,"Joey, it's a birthday party.",10,4
joey,"Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed    for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as    a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says ""El-moo""!     Yeah... that is a funny cup!",10,4
monica,Hey!,10,4
chandler,Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?,10,4
rachel,"Oh, she's still napping",10,4
chandler,"Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party    she knows is happening.",10,4
rachel,"Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't    a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a    first birthday again.",10,4
monica,All right... you are right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and    get the fun time started!,10,4
rachel,"No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.",10,4
monica,"Are you freaking kidding me, Green?",10,4
jack and judy,HI!,10,4
ross,Hey!,10,4
monica,So glad you came!,10,4
jack,I can't believe Emma is already one!,10,4
judy,I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the    attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to    take him to the emergency room!  Ross,10,4
joey,Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.,10,4
jack,Thank you!,10,4
joey,"Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what    would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!",10,4
jack,Which one are you?,10,4
monica,I can't believe Emma is still asleep!,10,4
chandler,"I know, what are we going to do?",10,4
monica,I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really    hard into your ribs. you are going to scream out and that'll wake her up!,10,4
chandler,I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!,10,4
joey,"Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song,    maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!  Phoebe",10,4
joey,"No, no, no! My talents as an actor!",10,4
phoebe,Oh!,10,4
joey,"You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one    of her books!",10,4
phoebe,Or you could stick a fork in an apple!,10,4
joey,"Hey, I think Emma might like it!",10,4
rachel,Oh! Emma might like what?,10,4
joey,"Um, my present!",10,4
rachel,What did you get her?,10,4
joey,Actually we prepared performances.,10,4
phoebe,Separate performances.,10,4
joey,But equally real!,10,4
rachel,"Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are    getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind    performing them once now?",10,4
phoebe,"Sure, yeah!",10,4
joey,O K.,10,4
rachel,"All right, let's get this party started, huh?    Joey and Phoebe are going to perform a little something for us.",10,4
ross,"Oh, great!",10,4
phoebe,Are you going to be embarrassed going up there having nothing    prepared?,10,4
joey,"Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole    crew waiting!",10,4
rachel,"So, Joey, what are you going to do for us?",10,4
joey,I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books.,10,4
rachel,"Oh, ok, which one?",10,4
joey,"Uh, why, it's a...  one of her favourites, uh, Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression eesh!  Love you forever. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed  in Mexico.    A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and    forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang I'll love    you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby    you'll be. .    And while he rocked her, he sang I'll love you forever, I'll    like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.",10,4
rachel,Wow! That was amazing!,10,4
ross,Thank you so much for that gift!,10,4
chandler,I was not ready for this today!,10,4
ross,Amazing... amazing.,10,4
rachel,"Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.",10,4
phoebe,"that is right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to    hers. For there's no greater gift, than the gift of music.  Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. Because not much else rhymes with Emma!    Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy    birthday Emma!",10,4
rachel,Is that it?,10,4
phoebe,"No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading . Sex and the single mother.  Finding your G-spot.",10,4
everybody,"No, no, no, no, no!",10,4
judy,Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.,10,4
jack,"Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.",10,4
judy,"Yes, you'll be all grown up by then. We'll be... Well your    grandfather and I might not be here.",10,4
jack,"that is true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the    grave, Emma!",10,4
judy,"After all, my parents died very young.",10,4
jack,And my cholesterol's off the charts!,10,4
judy,"Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!",10,4
ross,"Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was    just... yeah!",10,4
rachel,"Ross, um, don't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. It's    in a box in the fridge.",10,4
ross,Sure.,10,4
rachel,"Oh, you are going to love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey,    Corino's.",10,4
monica,"Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike    there when I was a kid.",10,4
rachel,"Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different    shapes, and if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing!",10,4
monica,"Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?",10,4
rachel,Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.,10,4
ross,"Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say    for bachelorette parties?",10,4
rachel,"Ross, what are you talking about?  oh! Oh my God!    They put my baby's face on a penis!",10,4
phoebe,oh! Now it's a party!,10,4
rachel,"Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to    be a disaster I would have baked it myself!",10,4
joey,Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?,10,4
judy,"Jack, look at this.",10,4
jack,"I know what you are thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!",10,4
ross,I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.,10,4
rachel,"No, no, this is not what I ordered.    Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for    my daughter's birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!",10,4
ross,"Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the    penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!",10,4
rachel,"Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even    want it in my home...  Joey, don't touch it!!",10,4
joey,I'm so confused!,10,4
rachel,"Yes, yes. I still want    my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with    nuts!",10,4
chandler,To be fair this one does have nuts.,10,4
ross,"Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could    go and get the cake.",10,4
monica,"Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!",10,4
ross,"Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message    to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok!",10,4
chandler,Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?,10,4
monica,"We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way.   You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!",10,4
chandler,"We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together    and things kind of unravelled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.",10,4
monica,"Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to    go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in    a half hour.",10,4
phoebe,"And you know, I have a massage client soon.",10,4
ross,"You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be    back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?",10,4
monica,"Alright, 5 more minutes.",10,4
ross,"Hello?  Oh no! What happened?  Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right    there.",10,4
chandler,Was that Emma? Is she up?,10,4
ross,"No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot    her licence so now I have to bring it to her.",10,4
phoebe,"Well, if you are leaving, I'm definitely going to go.",10,4
monica,No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us     We've been complaining the longest!,10,4
ross,"No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad    that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's going to feel when she comes    back here and all you guys are gone?",10,4
chandler,I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!,10,4
ross,"Joey! you are in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!",10,4
joey,Got it!  Hey hey hey!  Where do you think you are going?,10,4
chandler,To the bathroom!,10,4
joey,"Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're going to    be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!",10,4
phoebe,Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!,10,4
chandler,What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!,10,4
joey,"Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.",10,4
phoebe,"No, it did not.",10,4
joey,No.,10,4
judy,"Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at    night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.",10,4
jack,Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger    scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.,10,4
judy,"Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.",10,4
joey,Ok!,10,4
judy,Bye... Bye dear.,10,4
joey,Nighty-night!,10,4
judy,Nighty-night!,10,4
joey,"Bye, bye.",10,4
phoebe,Joey? How could you just let them leave?,10,4
joey,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not going to mess with Jack, he's a great man, he    fought for our country.",10,4
monica,"No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.",10,4
joey,Oh! Well that is it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you    guys in.,10,4
chandler,"You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?",10,4
joey,Oh! I forgot you used to live here!,10,4
joey,Hello?,10,4
estelle,Joey! It's Estelle!,10,4
joey,Hey!,10,4
estelle,"So, how did your audition go today?",10,4
joey,What audition?,10,4
estelle,The one I told you about last week?,10,4
joey,What? You never said anything about an audition!,10,4
estelle,Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition.    I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to    have a monologue prepared.,10,4
joey,A monologue? I don't have..  I got it.      Aah! so... I'm going to take off!,10,4
phoebe,"Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client    waiting outside my door any minute!",10,4
monica,"Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right    now!",10,4
phoebe,"Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as    the person who realized that, I get to go!",10,4
monica,No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.,10,4
joey,"Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever    gets the highest number gets to go first.",10,4
monica,"Ok, ten.",10,4
joey,"Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?",10,4
phoebe,"No, lets just draw straws.",10,4
joey,"Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..",10,4
chandler,I'm begging you stop.,10,4
joey,Right.,10,4
monica,"Ok, how about this",10,4
phoebe,Yeah!! Let's do that!,10,4
chandler,That sounds more fun than the thing we were going    to do in Vermont!,10,4
monica,Everybody get your toys!,10,4
phoebe,Ok! I want the dolphin!,10,4
chandler,That's a bear.,10,4
phoebe,I'm too excited!,10,4
monica,"Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler    and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go  from here to here. Now the one who comes    in last, stays!",10,4
joey,"Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!",10,4
chandler,"Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!",10,4
phoebe,Go! Go!,10,4
joey,Come on robot!,10,4
monica,What are you barking at?,10,4
monica,Wha... How the hell is that going to help?,10,4
chandler,I bought you. How did I forget that that is all you do?,10,4
joey,Way to go robot!,10,4
phoebe,Good job Alan!,10,4
joey,"Hey, good race you guys.",10,4
phoebe,"Yeah, see you later!",10,4
monica,"No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose.  The rules clearly    stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog    never crossed the finish line, so technically...",10,4
chandler,They left.,10,4
ross,RACHEL!,10,4
rachel,OOH! God! Sorry!,10,4
ross,I can't believe they gave you a ticket. you are such a    good driver.,10,4
rachel,Emma's awake.,10,4
ross,Yeah?,10,4
rachel,I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're    not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.,10,4
ross,"Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.",10,4
rachel,"Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday...    And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According    to the back cover of that book that you gave me.",10,4
ross,"Rach, she's not going to remember this.",10,4
rachel,"I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this    day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her    cake singing ""Happy Birthday"". Then we would all go into... HEY GET    OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!!  They have to learn!",10,4
ross,Hey!,10,4
rachel,What?,10,4
ross,It's not bad.,10,4
rachel,Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a    bunny. How did you do that?,10,4
ross,"Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this    to make ears.",10,4
rachel,"Well, I'm very impressed.",10,4
ross,"Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into    woodland creatures.",10,4
chandler,"I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?",10,4
monica,Game?,10,4
chandler,"Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? you are one! One-year-old,    that is little.",10,4
chandler,Ooh! that is my girl!,10,4
monica,that is how old you are.,10,4
chandler,Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?,10,4
monica,"Ooh, I want one...",10,4
chandler,Me too...,10,4
chandler,There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?,10,4
monica,...and head to Canada!,10,4
chandler,I was kidding.,10,4
monica,I wasn't. Let's get going!,10,4
phoebe,"Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?",10,4
chandler,"No, not yet.",10,4
phoebe,"Oh good, I didn't miss the party.",10,4
monica,What about your massage client?,10,4
phoebe,"I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something,    you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.",10,4
joey,"Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE    TIME!",10,4
joey,I've been here the whole time!,10,4
ross,"Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.",10,4
rachel,I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you are here. Thanks    you guys!,10,4
chandler,"Hey, guys! Come on! You got to see what Emma just did.",10,4
rachel,What?,10,4
chandler,"Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?",10,4
emma,Wo-ish.,10,4
rachel,"Oh! Emma, that is right! you are that many!",10,4
ross,"Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...",10,4
rachel,"NO, no science camp!",10,4
ross,Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.,10,4
rachel,"Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!",10,4
monica,Thanks!,10,4
ross,"Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow    out the candle. Come on Emma.",10,4
chandler,"Let's do it, come on!",10,4
ross,What's wrong? Are you okay?,10,4
rachel,"Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.",10,4
phoebe,"Hey, you made it into a bunny.",10,4
joey,What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it    was a penis.,10,4
rachel,Okay.,10,4
ross,"Okay, you ready?",10,4
rachel,Yeah.,10,4
ross,A-a-and... record.,10,4
rachel,"Okay.  Hi Emma. Well,    your first birthday is over, and it was really...",10,4
phoebe,"Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard!",10,4
rachel,"You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her    first cookie.",10,5
joey,Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!,10,5
rachel,I've never given her a cookie. Have you?,10,5
joey,"No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from    a can!",10,5
monica,"Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we    were wondering if you would write one for us.",10,5
rachel,"Of course, I'd be honoured!",10,5
chandler,Thanks!,10,5
monica,Thank you!,10,5
joey,"U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.",10,5
chandler,"Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.",10,5
monica,"Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much ""with    the words"".",10,5
joey,Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!,10,5
monica,Clearly we were wrong.,10,5
joey,"I got to a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how    much you want to have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.",10,5
monica,"You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.",10,5
joey,"Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm going to start... ""Dear baby    adoption decider people...""",10,5
chandler,So excited about your letter!,10,5
phoebe,Hey!,10,5

phoebe,"Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.",10,5
rachel,"OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss,    first time you had sex...",10,5
phoebe,YEAH!,10,5
chandler,So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?,10,5
phoebe,"Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.",10,5
joey,Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?,10,5
phoebe,"Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so    no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm going to put    on my finest jewellery and we're going to have sex in a public rest room.",10,5
monica,You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!,10,5
chandler,that is where people make number two!!,10,5
charlie,Hey!,10,5
ross,Hey...,10,5
charlie,"So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...",10,5

ross,Ehm... Her name is Emma.,10,5
amy,"Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!",10,5
ross,What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!,10,5
amy,"Hey, your English is getting better!!",10,5
ross,Oh my God!,10,5
joey,"I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.",10,5
ross,What... what you working on?,10,5
joey,"Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it    to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...",10,5
ross,Why don't you use your Thesaurus?,10,5
joey,What did I just say?,10,5
ross,"Watch.  Here, you ehm... You highlight the word    you want to change.   Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list    of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.",10,5
joey,"Oh my God, that is great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm...     ""brainy, bright, clever"", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey    Tribbiani's got the whole package!!",10,5
amy,So beautiful.,10,5
rachel,"Oh, I know, isn't she?",10,5
amy,"No, I was talking about your bedding.",10,5
rachel,"All right. What's your news, Amy?",10,5
amy,Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.,10,5
rachel,What? Oh my God! To who?,10,5
amy,This guy! He has a killer apartment.,10,5
rachel,A-And??,10,5
amy,A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.,10,5
rachel,"No, what's he like?",10,5
amy,Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?,10,5
rachel,Yeah.,10,5
amy,It's his dad.,10,5
rachel,"Huh... wow, so he's got to be...",10,5
amy,"Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.",10,5
rachel,"Sweety, I got to tell you... it sounds a little bit like you like the    apartment more than you like...",10,5
amy,Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!,10,5
rachel,"Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married    somebody that I didn't love. Do you remember Barry?",10,5
amy,"Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went    to sleep.",10,5
rachel,"Sometimes just nodding is ok.  Uhm, so but   anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever   made. Honey, you deserve   true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age,   that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!",10,5
amy,"you are right, you are right! I'm going to    do it!",10,5
rachel,Ok.,10,5
amy,I'm going to marry Myron and keep looking   for Mr Right.,10,5
rachel,"Ok, let's keep talking.",10,5
phoebe,"Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. . Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they're in my    seat. It's my anniversary.  Here we are! . Can't believe    it's been a whole year!",10,5

announcer,"Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the    big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask.",10,5
phoebe,"Oh how lame... oh, it's so tacky, and impersonal.",10,5
mike,Really?,10,5
phoebe,"Oh, it's the worst way to propose!",10,5
mike,Excuse me... .,10,5
joey,"Hey, finished my recommendation.  Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the    longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.",10,5
chandler,I don't... uh... understand.,10,5
joey,Some of the words are a little too sophisticated    for you?,10,5
monica,It doesn't make any sense.,10,5
joey,Of course it does! It's smart! I used the the-saurus!,10,5
chandler,On every word?,10,5
joey,Yep!,10,5
monica,"Alright, what was this sentence originally?",10,5
joey,"Oh, They are warm, nice, people with big hearts.",10,5
chandler,And that became they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?,10,5
joey,"Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.",10,5
monica,"Hey Joey, I don't think we can use this.",10,5
joey,Why not?,10,5
monica,"Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just    be yourself!",10,5
chandler,"You know what? You don't need a thesaurus, just write from  here,  your full sized aortic pump.",10,5
rachel,"Amy, hi!",10,5
amy,"I took your advice, I left Myron.",10,5
rachel,"Oh, good for you!",10,5
amy,I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!,10,5
rachel,"Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!",10,5
amy,"Thank you! So, can I stay with you?",10,5
rachel,But Erin Brockovich had her own house.,10,5
joey,"Ah, look who's back!  Why do you have bags? RACH,    WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?",10,5
amy,"Well, I'm staying with you guys!",10,5
joey,What?,10,5
amy,We're going to be roomies!  Come on!,10,5
joey,You slept out here?,10,5
rachel,"Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling Myron, get off!'",10,5
joey,"But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we're    getting rid of her.",10,5
rachel,"Joey, I can't do that!",10,5
joey,"Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said  ""Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!""    I don't need that kind of talk in my house!",10,5
rachel,"Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she's difficult, but I think    it's really good that she's here.",10,5
joey,Cause we will appreciate it more when she's gone?,10,5
rachel,"No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was    a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centred and you guys really took care of    me.",10,5
joey,"Yeah, Monica made us!",10,5
rachel,"Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, Because I don't    think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn't for you guys.    See, I want to help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it's going to    take patience, but that is ok.",10,5
amy,Good morning.,10,5
joey,Yeah.,10,5
rachel,"Amy, that is what I was supposed to wear today, that is why    I hung it on the door.",10,5
amy,"Oh, sweety, you can't pull this off.",10,5
rachel,"Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time    for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.",10,5
amy,"Oh, I can't, honey. I'm going to go get my eyebrows shaped.  I am not happy.     Oh... sure you want to eat that?",10,5
joey,"I'M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!",10,5
phoebe,Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.,10,5
chandler,I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.,10,5
monica,"Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote    me a rap song.",10,5
ross,Seriously?,10,5
chandler,Word!,10,5
phoebe,"Well, mine was worse than that.",10,5
rachel,"Well, what happened?",10,5
phoebe,"We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the    big screen thing...",10,5
rachel,"Oh, that is so tacky.",10,5
phoebe,"Well, that is what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning    on proposing to me that same way last night!",10,5
monica,"Oh my God, Mike was going to propose?",10,5
rachel,"Phoebe, that is huge!",10,5
ross,"Well, do you want to marry him?",10,5
phoebe,"Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was going to    propose to me, I don't think he's ever going to ask again! I mean,    I said no in Barbados and now this!",10,5
chandler,She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a   guy..?,10,5
monica,"Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to    him!",10,5
phoebe,"Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?",10,5
monica,"I proposed to Chandler!  Alright,    moving on...",10,5
chandler,"Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!",10,5
monica,Thank you.,10,5
phoebe,"Well, do you think   I should propose?",10,5
rachel,I think it could be kind of great!,10,5
ross,Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!,10,5
phoebe,"Ok, ok, so how should I do it?",10,5
monica,"How about at a game, on the big screen?",10,5
rachel,Uhh!! How about at a Footlocker?,10,5
monica,"What? what? He obviously thinks that is a nice way to be proposed to,    plus he'd never suspect it!",10,5
phoebe,"Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?",10,5
chandler,Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?,10,5
amy,Nana is on the phone,10,5
rachel,"Oh! that is interesting, since she died seven years    ago!!",10,5
amy,She did? Who got her condo in Boca?,10,5
rachel,"Hello?  Oh, it's our nanny!  Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye!      that is Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?",10,5
ross,"No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had?    Because my throat's been hurting?",10,5
rachel,Menstrual cramps.,10,5
ross,I don't think that is what this is.,10,5
rachel,Can any of you watch Emma?,10,5
monica,"No, sorry sweety..",10,5
phoebe,"No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..",10,5
rachel,"Great, shoot, what are we going to do?",10,5
amy,"Well, I can do it.",10,5
rachel,"Well, actually...",10,5
ross,"Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?",10,5
rachel,Yeah.,10,5
ross,"Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.",10,5
rachel,Why not?,10,5
ross,"Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!  Rachel",10,5
ross,"Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.",10,5
rachel,Wha... the next one?,10,5
ross,"Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.",10,5
rachel,"Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge    breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!",10,5
ross,I... I don't know..,10,5
rachel,"Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows  shaped to do this alright? Do you understand    how important that is in our world?",10,5
amy,"um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear...Because I was trying to...    Listen, let me do this alright? I really want to help you guys out, and plus Rachel's    been so wonderful to me...",10,5
rachel,Absolutely.,10,5
amy,Oh! Great! So how much does it pay?,10,5
chandler,Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?,10,5
joey,"Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.",10,5
monica,You dropped it off?,10,5
joey,Yeah.,10,5
chandler,Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?,10,5
joey,"No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to    hand-write it.",10,5
monica,You hand-wrote it?,10,5
joey,"Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at   all! See you later!",10,5
monica,"Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is going to go in our    file! We're never going to get a kid. No, we're going to be one of those old couples    that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!",10,5
chandler,"It's ok, it's ok. You know what?  I'll just    call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.",10,5
monica,Okay good.,10,5
chandler,"Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped    off a handwritten recommendation letter, and..  Uh-huh... Uh-huh...    okay... thank you. Good-bye. .",10,5
monica,"Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way    to the bird store.",10,5
chandler,They loved it.,10,5
monica,What?,10,5
chandler,They thought it was very smart of us to have a   child write the recommendation letter.,10,5
monica,They thought Joey was a child?,10,5
chandler,"She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.",10,5
amy,Hi!,10,5
monica,"Hey, what did you guys do today?",10,5
amy,"Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.",10,5
chandler,That sounds like fun.,10,5
amy,"Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.",10,5
rachel,"Hey! Hi, how's my girl?",10,5
amy,"I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?",10,5
rachel,Yeah!,10,5
amy,Ta-daaa!,10,5
rachel,You pierced her ears!?,10,5
amy,Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?,10,5
amy,"Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would    it?",10,5
chandler,I think she looks cute.     ... but I am wrong!,10,5
rachel,"Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's going to flip out.",10,5
amy,"Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?",10,5
rachel,Ugh.,10,5
ross,Hey guys.   Monica and Chandler,10,5
ross,"Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see.    .",10,5
rachel,"Nah, I don't really want her to see.",10,5
ross,Why not?,10,5
monica,Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.,10,5
chandler,Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was    in a milk carton but it looked like meat?,10,5
ross,Come here  Oh! There she is! Hi!,10,5
ross,What?,10,5
rachel,Nothing.,10,5
ross,Hi!  What... . Please tell me those are clip-ons.,10,5
rachel,"Oh, they're real!",10,5
ross,Did she  do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have    left Emma with her!,10,5
rachel,"I know, I know, and you were right Ross.    You are so irresponsible   I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!",10,5
amy,"Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs    to have a cool fun aunt!",10,5
monica,"I'm a cool, fun aunt!",10,5
amy,O-Okay!,10,5
chandler,Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!,10,5
rachel,I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure    out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?,10,5
amy,"Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going    to do with my life.",10,5
rachel,Oh yeah? Since when?,10,5
amy,Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.,10,5
rachel,What?,10,5
ross,that is not a thing!,10,5
amy,"Well, it should be. I'm going to help babies learn how to accessorize, what    colours to wear, what clothes are slimming...",10,5
rachel,Babies don't care if they're slim.,10,5
amy,Enter Amy!,10,5
ross,"Amy, I ju... I just... I just want to...",10,5
amy,What? What are you going to do?,10,5
ross,No more falafel for you!,10,5
mike,"Great game, huh?",10,5
phoebe,"Uhuh, uhuh...",10,5
mike,Why do you keep looking at the screen?,10,5
phoebe,I'm not. I'm praying.  Please let the Knicks win... Thank    you Thor!  Where... where are you going?,10,5
mike,Going go to the bathroom.,10,5
phoebe,"Well, I think you should wait.",10,5
mike,Why?,10,5
phoebe,"Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the    nutrients.",10,5
announcer,"Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the    big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.",10,5
phoebe,Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?,10,5
announcer,Get a load of this... She's proposing   to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.,10,5
phoebe,that is not very enlightened!,10,5
phoebe,"Hey, hey!  Boo us? Boo you!",10,5
joey,"Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani...    Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home    right now...  Okay, bye bye.   She was    nice!",10,5
rachel,"Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!",10,5
joey,Whoo-hoo!,10,5
amy,you are kicking me out?,10,5
rachel,You put holes in my baby's ears!,10,5
amy,"Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!",10,5
rachel,I can't believe I ever even tried to help   you. You are so  beyond help.,10,5
amy,"You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.",10,5
rachel,Excuse me?,10,5
amy,"You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then,    I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws  And suddenly I am the bad guy?",10,5
rachel,"Joey, where are those bags?",10,5
joey,She has a lot of crap!,10,5
amy,You know what? When I moved in here I thought,10,5
rachel,Seriously?,10,5
amy,hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.,10,5
rachel,Hips or thighs?,10,5
amy,Ass and face.,10,5
rachel,Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.,10,5
amy,"She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking    about real stuff.",10,5
rachel,"Oh, I can give you that.",10,5
amy,You can?,10,5
rachel,"Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you are...    you are already a pretty perfect version of what you are.",10,5
amy,"Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.",10,5
rachel,Did you just say Emma?,10,5
amy,"Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.",10,5
phoebe,"That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking    about. Mike, obviously you have balls.",10,5
mike,"But please, let's just forget the whole thing.",10,5
phoebe,"I would love it. Consider    it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose,    I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball    game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who    hides it in the cake.",10,5
phoebe,"It's in the cake, isn't it?",10,5
mike,Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it?,10,5
phoebe,"What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm    sorry!",10,5
mike,No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and    all I want to do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my    life with you.,10,5
mike,I'm going to do this now.,10,5
phoebe,Oh my God!,10,5
mike,"Phoebe, I...",10,5
phoebe,Wait! Oh wait!  Oh no!,10,5
mike,Ready?,10,5
phoebe,Uh-huh!,10,5
mike,"Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry    me... three times. But I want to take care of you, have babies with you, and grow    old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?",10,5
phoebe,Yes!,10,5
mike,I love you!,10,5
phoebe,I love you more!,10,5
mike,Not possible!  She's going to    be Mrs. No Balls.,10,5
rachel,So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?,10,5
amy,Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies    are ugly.,10,5
rachel,that is shocking!,10,5
amy,Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross!  Hello-oo Ross!  He's rude!,10,5
phoebe,Hey...,10,6

phoebe,"Thank you!  Oh, and I have something for    you!",10,6
rachel,Mmh-mmh!,10,6
phoebe,"It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers    of all the guys I've dated.",10,6
rachel,"Oh, Pheebs, baby, that is nice but, you know what,    I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?",10,6
phoebe,"I would, but you are the last one.",10,6
rachel,"GIVE ME THE BOOK!  Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, ""Guy-in-van""?",10,6
phoebe,"Oh, my first love!",10,6
rachel,Oh!,10,6
monica,What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?,10,6
phoebe,"Dead.  Oh, it's OK, no,   he  was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave   at Omaha Beach.",10,6
chandler,"Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my    black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin.    With Janice's phone number on it.",10,6
rachel,"Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?",10,6

joey,Cool!,10,6
chandler,"Yeah, and I don't want to brag but a lot of the ideas    were mine!  Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were   mine!!!",10,6
joey,"that is great! Hey, can you cast me in it?",10,6
chandler,"Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you are    right for the part.",10,6
joey,"What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon!    Huh?  I'm old!  I'm tired!     Hey, I'm hot  I'm cold!! Huh??    Come on! What can't I do?",10,6
chandler,"First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think    you are right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.",10,6
joey,"I can do that!  ""Hello, I'm    your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing.    I like to use..."" Oh, what's the product?",10,6

charlie,"Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand    up his kilt, I'm going to say congratulations!",10,6
ross,"Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds    of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not      that I'm keeping score or anything... five!",10,6
charlie,"Wow, that is great! So, tell me about the grant!",10,6
ross,"Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get    it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there    will be  an article about me in the ""Palaeontology Review""! Yeah!    That'll be  the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious    questions    about my work!",10,6
charlie,Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?,10,6
ross,Yeah. Why?,10,6
charlie,Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.,10,6
ross,Your ex-boyfriend?,10,6
charlie,Yeah.,10,6
ross,"So, your ex-boyfriend is going to determine if your new    boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!",10,6
charlie,"No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything,    I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner    together, and I can introduce you.",10,6
ross,"Well, if you think it would help.",10,6
charlie,"Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.",10,6
ross,"Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know,    butter him up? Anything he really likes?",10,6
charlie,Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.,10,6
ross,We'll see how dinner goes.,10,6
phoebe,Hey!,10,6
monica,"Hey, you want to go to see a movie?",10,6
phoebe,"Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing    out stuff, so Mike could move in.",10,6
monica,"Oh, right.",10,6
phoebe,Yeah.,10,6
monica,"Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you    with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!",10,6
phoebe,"Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did   you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?",10,6
monica,"Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you  to give  up?  Phoebe",10,6
monica,Who's Gladys?  Oh! What a tragic loss!,10,6
phoebe,"Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh,   I know!! Oh, you should take her!",10,6
monica,"Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...",10,6
phoebe,"Why, you don't like her?",10,6
monica,"Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll    take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you are giving up too    easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!",10,6
phoebe,Really? You think?,10,6
monica,"Absolutely! Yes, you say to him ""I'm sorry    Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!""",10,6
phoebe,"Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just    realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.",10,6
monica,"Damn it, I did not think this through!",10,6
chandler,Hey you guys.,10,6
rachel,Hi!,10,6
joey,Oh! Any word on casting yet?,10,6
chandler,"Joe, I told you, you are just not right for    the part.",10,6
joey,"What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor    you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?",10,6
rachel,"I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never going to    be interested in.",10,6
joey,"Look, c'mon, please? It's    not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I    am a professional actor!  Oh, man,    I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a    copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.",10,6
chandler,Joe...,10,6
joey,"Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't    pass it on to your bosses!",10,6
chandler,Fine!,10,6
joey,Thank you.,10,6
chandler,"Work, Joe!",10,6
joey,Damn it!,10,6
chandler,What am I going to do now?,10,6
joey,Just pass it to your boss!,10,6
chandler,"He's not right for the part. So if I suggest    him, my bosses are going to think I'm an idiot! And that is something they should    learn on their own!",10,6
rachel,"Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked    it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you are the good guy and    they're the bad guys.",10,6
chandler,"that is good! I liked it, they didn't.     Joey, for God's sake,    go to work! .",10,6
charlie,"Sorry, looks    like it's just him.",10,6
benjamin,"Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!",10,6
ross,"Well, I... I am having a good hair day.",10,6
benjamin,So good to see you.,10,6
charlie,Me too.,10,6
ross,I'm ok.,10,6
charlie,I'm sorry...  Ross    Geller... Benjamin Hobart.,10,6
ross,"It's an honour to meet you. I can't tell    you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,     whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you are one of    the reasons I got into the field.",10,6
benjamin,"Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've    never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!",10,6
charlie,Shall we? .,10,6
benjamin,Thank you! . I can't    believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?,10,6
charlie,"Oh my God, I completely forgot!  Oh   my  God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! .",10,6
benjamin,You weren't there!,10,6
ross,"No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image,    you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz,    mmm.",10,6
charlie,"Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal,    while I go to the ladies room?",10,6
benjamin,"So, tell me about it.",10,6
ross,"Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.",10,6
benjamin,M-m.,10,6
ross,"See, there are still several areas that haven't    been fully excavated.",10,6
benjamin,Break up with Charlie!,10,6
ross,What?,10,6
benjamin,What?,10,6
ross,"Did you just say ""break up with Charlie""?",10,6
benjamin,"Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I    didn't not say it.",10,6
ross,"Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?",10,6
benjamin,"I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so    long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much    I missed her, and I'm going to need you to break up with her.",10,6
ross,Are you serious?,10,6
benjamin,"If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then    I'm joking!",10,6
ross,No!,10,6
benjamin,Joking it is!,10,6
phoebe,"Hi! Sorry, I'm late.",10,6
monica,"Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he going to let you    keep the painting?",10,6
phoebe,"No, he really hates it. But he's going to let me    keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news    is, Gladys is yours!",10,6
monica,"Wow, what's the bad news!",10,6
rachel,Who's Gladys?,10,6
phoebe,"Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know,    with the woman coming out of the frame.",10,6
rachel,"Oh, and Monica gets to keep her?   In her house? I am so jealous!",10,6
phoebe,"Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!",10,6
monica,Huh!,10,6
rachel,"Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already    gave that to Monica, so...",10,6
monica,"You know, I would give her up, for you.",10,6
rachel,"No, I couldn't let you do that.",10,6
monica,But I want to.,10,6
rachel,But I don't want you to.,10,6
monica,But I insist!,10,6
rachel,But I insist harder!,10,6
phoebe,"Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads,    she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!",10,6
monica,"No, that landed in your food!",10,6
rachel,"No, no, that is ok. You won fair    and square. I'm so sad!",10,6
chandler,Hey Joe!,10,6
joey,What's up?,10,6
chandler,Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along    to my bosses and they weren't interested.,10,6
joey,Oh.,10,6
chandler,I'm sorry man.,10,6
joey,"But, ehm... you watched    the tape?",10,6
chandler,"Yeah! I... I... I liked it!  But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it.    Stupid sons of bitches!",10,6
joey,You didn't watch the tape.,10,6
chandler,What!? Of course I did!,10,6
joey,"Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?",10,6
chandler,"I'm not lying to you, I watched it!",10,6
joey,"Well, you lied again!",10,6
chandler,I watched it!,10,6
joey,Keep going Pinocchio!,10,6
chandler,I did!,10,6
joey,No you didn't!,10,6
chandler,"I'm telling you, I watched the tape.",10,6
rachel,Did you watch the tape?,10,6
chandler,No!,10,6
benjamin,"The selection committee has chosen the three of    you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers    you give to the questions I ask here. I'm going to start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you    claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you    propose to correct this problem?",10,6
dr. li,"Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological    evidence. I plan to begin there.",10,6
benjamin,Interesting.,10,6
ross,I guess!,10,6
benjamin,"Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work.    Where might that take place?",10,6
dr. biely,Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.,10,6
benjamin,"Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my    birthday?",10,6
ross,What? I... I...,10,6
benjamin,Care to venture a guess?,10,6
ross,May 12th?,10,6
benjamin,"that is not even    kind of close!  Dr. Li, how many graduate students    you'd be needing?",10,6
dr. li,Half a dozen.,10,6
benjamin,"I see, and Dr. Biely?",10,6
dr. biely,Three for excavation and two for analysis.,10,6
benjamin,"Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit    was later covered by a popular British invasion band?",10,6
ross,Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.,10,6
benjamin,"No! I'm sorry, we were looking for ""Baby It's    You"". Baby It's You.",10,6
ross,"Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my    questions have anything to do with Palaeontology.",10,6
benjamin,"you are right, I apologize. Scratch the last question.    Spell ""Boscodictiasaur"".",10,6
ross,"um... I've never heard of a ""Boscodictiasaur"".",10,6
benjamin,"Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.",10,6
ross,Ok.  B - O - S ...,10,6
benjamin,"No, it starts with a silent ""M"".",10,6
ross,Oh come on!!,10,6
chandler,I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!,10,6
rachel,But you are a liar.,10,6
chandler,What did I just say?,10,6
joey,You still here?,10,6
chandler,"Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am    insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...",10,6
joey,"Ok whoa-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok?    First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about    lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying    about... lying...   Stop lying!",10,6
chandler,Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?,10,6
joey,You want to know wh...? You want to know why?,10,6
rachel,"Well, this is going well.",10,6
joey,"Here's how I know you didn't    watch the tape, ok?  If you had seen what was on this    tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I    got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.",10,6
chandler,He really is a chameleon.,10,6
phoebe,"Well, Gladys say hello to    your new home!",10,6
monica,"Oh, my!",10,6
rachel,"Wow!  Oh,    she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh    so proudly?",10,6
rachel,"Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be    the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!",10,6
phoebe,"Yeah, yeah! And you can    get rid of that French poster.",10,6
monica,I like that poster!,10,6
phoebe,Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it.    Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?,10,6
rachel,Oh! There's    nothing above your bed!!,10,6
monica,Are you still here?,10,6
benjamin,I've come here to apologize. I think I may have    let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.,10,6
ross,No! Stop!,10,6
benjamin,"Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.",10,6
ross,Really?,10,6
benjamin,Well... there is just one small... stipulation...,10,6
ross,I have to break up with Charlie?,10,6
benjamin,"Hey, you got one right!",10,6
ross,you are crazy.,10,6
benjamin,"Crazy, or... romantic?",10,6
ross,Crazy!,10,6
benjamin,Or...,10,6
ross,Get out!,10,6
rachel,O-oh my God!,10,6
joey,What?,10,6
rachel,"Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?",10,6
joey,I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very    reasonable price.,10,6
rachel,"Joey, we're not keeping this!",10,6
joey,But it's an original Buffay...,10,6
rachel,"Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't    mind that she's haunted.",10,6
joey,Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?,10,6
rachel,"Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive    when you are asleep.",10,6
rachel,"She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body    across the floor, just looking for legs to steal.     And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your    doorknob.",10,6
joey,GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!,10,6
monica,Hey! I sold that to Joey.,10,6
rachel,"Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at    this game.",10,6
monica,"No, too late. You can't give it back!",10,6
rachel,Yes I can!,10,6
monica,No you can't. She's yours!,10,6
rachel,She's yours!,10,6
monica,SHE'S YOURS!,10,6
rachel,She's yours!,10,6
phoebe,Hey!,10,6
rachel,She's mine!,10,6
monica,She's m-i-i-ne!,10,6
rachel,She's mine!,10,6
monica,She's mine!,10,6
phoebe,You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her    anymore.  Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.,10,6
rachel,I want Gladys!,10,6
monica,She's mine!,10,6
rachel,She's mine!,10,6
monica,She's mine!,10,6
rachel,She's mine!,10,6
chandler,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And    I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part    or not.",10,6
joey,that is not the point Chandler. The point is that you    lied.,10,6
chandler,I know. you are right. What's it going to take for you    to forgive me?,10,6
monica,Oh my God!,10,6
rachel,Excellent!,10,6
joey,"Now, what do you say?",10,6
chandler,Lying is wrong!,10,6
joey,And?... AND?,10,6
chandler,I'm a pretty little girl.,10,6
phoebe,I knew it!,10,6
ross,Your ex-boyfriend is insane.,10,6
charlie,Did you get the grant?,10,6
ross,"No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your    ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.",10,6
charlie,What?,10,6
ross,"Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't    give you up.",10,6
charlie,"Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up    with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.",10,6
ross,"Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review,    who was the voice of ""Underdog""?",10,6
charlie,"I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.",10,6
ross,"If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay?    I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.",10,6
charlie,Seriously?,10,6
ross,"Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do    you spell Mboscodictiosaur?",10,6
charlie,"Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then    M-B-O...",10,6
ross,Damnit!,10,6
benjamin,Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are    you doing here?,10,6
ross,"I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you    tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! that is the    voice of Underdog!",10,6
benjamin,"Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross,    this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.",10,6
ross,"No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in    the eyes, and tell her the truth.",10,6
charlie,Benji?,10,6
benjamin,"Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's    only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in    my life.",10,6
ross,"Too little, too late, Benji!",10,6
charlie,I can't believe this.,10,6
benjamin,"I never should have broken up with you. I think    about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?",10,6
ross,No!,10,6
charlie,Yes!,10,6
ross,What?,10,6
charlie,"I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so....    romantic.",10,6
ross,or...,10,6
benjamin,"Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here,    but is there any chance you will take me back?",10,6
charlie,Maybe...,10,6
ross,"Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a    little uncomfortable.",10,6
charlie,"Oh God! I am so sorry, but...  I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...",10,6
benjamin,I'm sorry    too...,10,6
benjamin,I love you!,10,6
charlie,I love you too!,10,6
ross,"Okay, that is it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!",10,6
joey,Gladys?,10,6
rachel,"Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not    get old.",10,6
joey,you are mean!,10,6
rachel,"Oh, don't be such a baby!",10,6
ross,Hey you guys!,10,7
phoebe,Hey!,10,7
ross,"Hey, what are you doing?",10,7
mike,"Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.",10,7
chandler,"that is funny, we were doing the same thing!",10,7
ross,Yeah!,10,7
phoebe,"It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea    how expensive this stuff was!",10,7
chandler,"Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the    numbers.",10,7
phoebe,So what did you two do about it?,10,7
chandler,"It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting    solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.",10,7
ross,"There's no way around it Pheebs, you just going to have to accept the fact    that this is going to cost you a lot of money.",10,7
mike,I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.,10,7
ross,"Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.",10,7
phoebe,"But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?",10,7
mike,Are you serious?,10,7
phoebe,"Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity    and we just got married at City Hall?",10,7
mike,I think it would make me want to marry you even more.,10,7
ross,"I've got to say you guys, that is an incredible gesture!",10,7
chandler,Maybe you do that next time you get married!,10,7
ross,"No, no, no. The next time it's going to be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that!",10,7
joey,Hey!,10,7
chandler,Hey!,10,7
joey,What's going on?,10,7
chandler,Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning    the apartment.,10,7
monica,We?,10,7
chandler,You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!,10,7
joey,"Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?",10,7
chandler,Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.,10,7
monica,"And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about    us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.",10,7
joey,"Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very    impressive when the little people know a celebrity.",10,7
chandler,Little people?,10,7
joey,Celebrity.,10,7
monica,"Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff    hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?",10,7
chandler,What...? NO!,10,7
monica,Chandler?,10,7
chandler,"I don't, and I'm offended    by the insinuation!",10,7
monica,"Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes    taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?",10,7
chandler,"I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not    mine.",10,7
monica,It isn't mine!,10,7
joey,"Well, I guess we'll never know whose    it is!",10,7
charity guy,May I help you?,10,7
phoebe,Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.,10,7
charity guy,"Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.",10,7
phoebe,"Well, I think you are going to appreciate it the crap out of this one",10,7
charity guy,"Well, this is very generous!",10,7
phoebe,And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.,10,7
mike,Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.,10,7
phoebe,Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.,10,7
charity guy,"Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.",10,7
mike,Not necessary.,10,7
phoebe,Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.,10,7
mike,"And ""X"" is spelled uhm... ""Mike Hannigan"".",10,7
charity guy,"Right. Well, on behalf of the children",10,7
phoebe,"Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!",10,7
mike,It does. It feels really good!,10,7
phoebe,"Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!",10,7
charity guy,"Oh, actually, that is the shirt I wore to the gym.",10,7
phoebe,Mhm... it's moist.,10,7
ross,Hi!,10,7
rachel,Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!,10,7
ross,"Oh, good!",10,7
rachel,"Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.",10,7
ross,"Oh, that is OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful palaeontologists    out there.",10,7
rachel,Absolutely.,10,7
ross,There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under    a bridge!,10,7
rachel,"So, uhm... what are you going to do today?",10,7
ross,"Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!",10,7
rachel,"Oh my God, what!?",10,7
ross,Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and    fire!,10,7
rachel,"Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.",10,7
ross,Because...,10,7
rachel,"All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing    incident... when I was little.",10,7
ross,Seriously?,10,7
rachel,"Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden    my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut    a big chunk of my hair!  And it was uneven for weeks!",10,7
ross,And you made it through that? I wonder who's going to play you    in the movie!,10,7
rachel,"Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And    I was thinking Claire Danes.",10,7
ross,"Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly    safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and    you'll see!",10,7
rachel,"Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you are... and    there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you are    going to return back to earth!",10,7
ross,"Space is filled with orbiting children.  Look, please, just come    on, you know, when you'll see the look on Emma's face, I swear you    won't regret it.",10,7
rachel,All right!,10,7
ross,"Good, you don't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their    irrational fears on their children, do you?",10,7
rachel,"Irrational, huh? All right, well, I'll remember that the next    time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!",10,7
ross,"Oh, yeah, that is the same, I am sure there are thirty different    species of poisonous swings!",10,7
monica,"Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!",10,7
chandler,"Ok, ok, here we go.",10,7
monica,Ok.,10,7
chandler,Here we go. Stand up straight.  Big smile.,10,7
phoebe,"Hello, is this the creepy residence?",10,7
monica,"We're waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I'm glad    you are here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don't know if you want to use it, but-",10,7
phoebe,"Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won't be needing    a veil, I actually won't be wearing a dress at all!",10,7
monica,I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!,10,7
phoebe,"No, no, no, we're not having a big reception, we took the money    we were going to spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.",10,7
monica,that is crazy! . I am sorry. I just can't    imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!,10,7
phoebe,"We, you know, we're different! We don't care about having    a huge party.  This is really nice for you, but, oh,    please, I put this on?  And, ow, I look , why, well, radiant.  All right, well, who cares,    I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.",10,7
monica,"that is right. you are making a commitment and that is    the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you going to do it?",10,7
phoebe,City Hall.,10,7
monica,"Ow!  Oh, that sounds nice! I am just    there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!",10,7
phoebe,"It's ok, it's ok. I made my decision. What I really want    is a great big wedding",10,7
monica,Yay!,10,7
chandler,But you already gave all your money to charity!,10,7
phoebe,"Well, I'll just ask for it back!",10,7
chandler,I don't think you can do that!,10,7
monica,"Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some    stupid kids!",10,7
chandler,"that is sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.",10,7
rachel,"Ok, careful.",10,7
ross,Ok.,10,7
rachel,"Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!",10,7
ross,"Rach, she's got like three hairs!",10,7
rachel,"I know  but they're just so beautiful!    Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.",10,7
ross,I promise you she's safe! No watch how much she loves this.,10,7
rachel,Ok.,10,7
ross,Ready sweety?,10,7
rachel,Ok.,10,7
ross,Here we go!,10,7
rachel,"Ok, careful, ok.  Oh, she's smiling! Oh my God,    she does like it!",10,7
ross,"See, I told you!",10,7
rachel,"Awe!  Oh my God! Looks, she's a little dare-devil!    Oh, let me push, can I push?",10,7
ross,"Oh, absolutely!",10,7
rachel,"Ok. Oh God.  Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag.",10,7
ross,"Ok!  See? Scared    of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly  Ow!",10,7
mike,We're seriously asking for our money back?,10,7
phoebe,"It's for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight,    because one of us going to have to start flirting.",10,7
charity guy,Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don't    think that that is ever happened before.,10,7
phoebe,"Gay, go.",10,7
mike,"Oh my God, I love your shirt!",10,7
phoebe,"The donation we made earlier, we k-, we w-, we want it    back.",10,7
charity guy,Excuse me?,10,7
phoebe,"Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn't    want, but it turns out we do.",10,7
charity guy,So you are asking us to refund your donation to the children?,10,7
mike,Yeah! This feels really good.,10,7
phoebe,"I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.",10,7
charity guy,"Hey, it's not my business,  besides it's probably a good thing. We really would have been    spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing-",10,7
phoebe,"Hey, that is not fair! A person's wedding is important!    And especially to me! Ok? I didn't have a graduation party! And I didn't    go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an    escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to kill me or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not going to let some sweaty    little man make me feel badly about it.",10,7
mike,She could have been talking about either one of us.,10,7
laura,"Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.",10,7
monica,"Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.",10,7
laura,Thank you!,10,7
monica,Would you like something to drink?,10,7
laura,"Oh, water would be fine.",10,7
monica,Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We're really excited    about getting this process started.,10,7
chandler,"Oh, because we love kids. Love them to death. Well, not actually to death, that is just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...    as allowed by law.",10,7
laura,Your place is just lovely.,10,7
monica,"Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.",10,7
laura,"You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples    in the    building adopting?",10,7
monica,Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby    before    them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.,10,7
chandler,"But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.",10,7
laura,Oh...,10,7
chandler,What?,10,7
laura,I just realized why I remember this place.,10,7
monica,Really? What is it?,10,7
laura,"Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building    and it    didn't end very well.",10,7
monica,OH... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?,10,7
laura,Yes!,10,7
chandler,Of course it was!,10,7
laura,"Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he    would call    me and he didn't.",10,7
chandler,RAT BASTARD!,10,7
laura,So you are not friends with him?,10,7
monica and chandler,"OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no,    no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO!  No!",10,7
laura,"Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning    on staying at    home with your child...",10,7
joey,Hello? Anybody in there order a celebrity?        OW!,10,7
laura,What was that?,10,7
chandler,"Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great    with    kids though.",10,7
rachel,"Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?",10,7
ross,SON OF A BITCH!      Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word!,10,7
rachel,"Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it.    That is    the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.",10,7
ross,"No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault    and kind    of that  kids fault. Who is still laughing.    Nice.",10,7
rachel,"Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else    gets    hurt?",10,7
ross,"No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing,    okay? And    you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.",10,7
rachel,I know what this is all about... You've    always been    jealous of my hair.,10,7
ross,"Look, I just think you are an adult, okay? And you should get over your    silly    fears.",10,7
rachel,Alright fine. I'll do it.,10,7
ross,Good.,10,7
rachel,If you hold a spider.,10,7
ross,WHAT?    WHERE? WHERE?,10,7
rachel,IF you hold a spider.,10,7
ross,I know.,10,7
joey,"Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...",10,7
chandler,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!,10,7
laura,What's going on?,10,7
chandler,"Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.",10,7
joey,Guys!?,10,7
monica,Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!,10,7
joey,What's going on?,10,7
chandler,"WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!",10,7
joey,Everything doesn't sound fine!,10,7
laura,Is he alright out there by himself?,10,7
chandler,Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.,10,7
laura,Bert and Ernie!,10,7
chandler,You can't make this stuff up!,10,7
mike,"You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm    sorry about    that.",10,7
phoebe,Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.,10,7
mike,"Well, hey, at least you are getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really    deserve that.",10,7
phoebe,"Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up.  Just like the kids I took the money from.",10,7
mike,"No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.",10,7
phoebe,"Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.",10,7
mike,"Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.",10,7
phoebe,"And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't    shot    anyone in a really long time.",10,7
laura,"Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child    in.",10,7
monica,"Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the    furniture,    because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!",10,7
laura,"Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything    I need    up to here...",10,7
monica,Why don't I show you the baby's room?,10,7
chandler,What the hell are you doing?,10,7
joey,"Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.",10,7
chandler,"Well, we're not.",10,7
joey,But you called me 'Bert'!? that is our code word for danger!,10,7
chandler,We don't have a code word.,10,7
joey,"We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word    for danger.",10,7
monica,So that was the baby's room.,10,7
monica,What room should we see next?,10,7
chandler,Any room that isn't behind this couch!,10,7
monica,"Some people    don't    get him, but I think he's really funny! .",10,7
joey,I did not care for that!,10,7
chandler,"You have to get out of here. You slept    with    our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so    she can't    see you.",10,7
joey,"Ok, ok!",10,7
chandler,Ok!,10,7
chandler,What?,10,7
joey,I forgot my bat.,10,7
laura,Oh my God!,10,7
chandler,"And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And    we don't want to buy your bat!",10,7
laura,What are you doing here?,10,7
joey,Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!,10,7
laura,Are you friends with him?,10,7
chandler,I can explain... Joey...,10,7
joey,"Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back    here. I can't believe you never called me.",10,7
laura,Excuse me?,10,7
joey,"Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by    the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it...    lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.",10,7
laura,"I gave you my number, you never called me.",10,7
joey,"No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of...    social work, ok, that you can just... do.",10,7
laura,"Well, I'm pretty sure I gave    you my number.",10,7
joey,"Really? Think about it. Come on! you are a beautiful woman, smart, funny,    we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?",10,7
laura,"I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...",10,7
joey,"No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You    know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you?",10,7
laura,"Joey, wait!",10,7
joey,"NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore...",10,7
laura,I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...,10,7
chandler,"Oh, that is really ok.",10,7
monica,"Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.",10,7
laura,"Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you are going    to make excellent parents.",10,7
joey,LAURA!,10,7
phoebe,We're back!,10,7
charity guy,"Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you are    looking for is an ATM.",10,7
mike,"No, no, we're here to give the money back.",10,7
phoebe,"Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.",10,7
phoebe,"Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here.  No... Oh God... Oh!",10,7
charity guy,"If I haven't said so already sir,     congratulations!",10,7
mike,"Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping    in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this    decision for us.  Now... what do you think we should do?",10,7
charity guy,You know what? It's not your decision anymore.,10,7
mike,What?,10,7
charity guy,"On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.",10,7
phoebe,But... but... but we're giving you this!,10,7
charity guy,Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it    a contribution.,10,7
phoebe,"Well, this is very generous!",10,7
charity guy,"Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful    life together.",10,7
mike,"Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come    back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.",10,7
charity guy,"Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.",10,7
phoebe,"Oh, is that you?",10,7
charity guy,No!,10,7
monica,"Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler...    Ok, goodbye.",10,7
chandler,Wrong number?,10,7
monica,It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on    the waiting list.,10,7
chandler,that is great!,10,7
monica,Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's    a baby waiting for us. Oh...,10,7
chandler,Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?,10,7
rachel,"Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.",10,7
ross,Ok...,10,7
rachel,Ok...,10,7
ross,"This feels perfectly normal. Ok,    get on the swing!",10,7
rachel,Ok... O-k...,10,7
rachel,Ok...,10,7
rachel,who... ok... wow... ok... OH!,10,7
ross,See?,10,7
rachel,A-alright! I can do this.,10,7
ross,"There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used    to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.",10,7
rachel,that is because he's on your neck.,10,7
ross,Well...  Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...,10,7
rachel,ROSS!,10,7
monica,Hey guys!,10,8
rachel,Hi!,10,8
phoebe,Hey!,10,8
monica,We need to talk to you about something.,10,8
chandler,Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.,10,8
all,What?,10,8
phoebe,Hey!,10,8
ross,Are you kidding?,10,8
chandler,"Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.",10,8
ross,That doesn't sound like you... that is Monica talking!,10,8
chandler,"No, no! We made this decision together.",10,8
ross,She's putting words in your mouth!,10,8
joey,"Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!",10,8
rachel,I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!,10,8
monica,"No, it's not!",10,8
rachel,It's not?  When was she born?,10,8
phoebe,"Well, personally I think it's great you are giving yourself a break.",10,8
monica,"Thank you, Pheebs!",10,8
phoebe,"Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.",10,8
monica,"What? You are way off, lady!",10,8
phoebe,"Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.",10,8
monica,"that is my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!",10,8
chandler,Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!,10,8
monica,"Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!",10,8
chandler,We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?,10,8
phoebe,Hey!,10,8
rachel,Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!,10,8
phoebe,"Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.",10,8
monica,"You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?",10,8
phoebe,you are not making the pies yourself?,10,8
monica,"No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.",10,8
rachel,Did you at least win the contest?,10,8
monica,"2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.",10,8
rachel,Can't wait!,10,8
monica,"This dinner is going to be so great! In your face, last year ""me""!",10,8
phoebe,Hey Rach.,10,8
rachel,Yeah.,10,8
phoebe,What's Emma doing today?,10,8
rachel,"Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?",10,8
phoebe,"Well, I want to enter her in a baby beauty pageant.",10,8
rachel,Oh my God! that is the creepiest thing I've ever heard!,10,8
phoebe,"Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!",10,8
rachel,"Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!",10,8
phoebe,Oh... okay.,10,8
rachel,"Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...",10,8
rachel,And a thousand dollars.,10,8
rachel,"...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that  what's in the inside is important...",10,8
phoebe,"Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.",10,8
rachel,Where am I going to get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?,10,8
phoebe,"Well, I was thinking...",10,8
rachel,"Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.",10,8
phoebe,Yeah!,10,8
monica,Did someone drop the baton again?,10,8
chandler,Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?,10,8
monica,I don't get older. I just get better!,10,8
chandler,"You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!",10,8
monica,You don't know that.,10,8
chandler,Somebody is going to pick us.,10,8
monica,"Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!",10,8
chandler,"I'm telling you! It's going to happen. Next year it's going to be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing.  What, he's my favourite author!",10,8
monica,Name one of his books.,10,8
chandler,"""The Firm""?",10,8
monica,"Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...",10,8
chandler,"You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.",10,8
monica,"Oh, Chandler, that is sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.",10,8
chandler,"I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile"".",10,8
monica,"Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.",10,8
chandler,Tell me more.,10,8
monica,"Okay, I'm going to go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these  Not with soap!!",10,8
chandler,You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!,10,8
ross,"Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!",10,8
joey,Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!,10,8
ross,"Dude, I wanted him to guess.",10,8
joey,Oh.,10,8
chandler,Oh my God!,10,8
joey,"Yeah, they're great seats too!",10,8
ross,Guess where they are?,10,8
joey,Centre ice.,10,8
ross,Did I do something to you?,10,8
chandler,"Hmm, the game's at one.",10,8
ross,So?,10,8
chandler,"Dinner is at four, we'll never going to make it back.",10,8
joey,"So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.",10,8
chandler,"You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.",10,8
joey,"Dude, two times that happened!",10,8
chandler,"Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't want to host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!",10,8
ross,"He's right, man.",10,8
joey,"Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.",10,8
chandler,Okay.  And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!,10,8
joey,"that is some gentle comedy, dude.",10,8
ross,"We're still going at the game, right?",10,8
joey,Yeah!,10,8
ross,Yeah.,10,8
host,"This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...",10,8
phoebe,Hey.,10,8
rachel,"Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we got to go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!",10,8
phoebe,"We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!",10,8
rachel,"Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!",10,8
phoebe,"Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared.  It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.",10,8
rachel,"Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We got to go, we got dinner!",10,8
phoebe,"But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!",10,8
rachel,"Phoebe, you have to calm down.",10,8
phoebe,"Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!",10,8
rachel,Really?,10,8
phoebe,Yeah!,10,8
rachel,You heard them say that?,10,8
phoebe,Yeah!,10,8
rachel,"All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!",10,8
phoebe,Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!,10,8
rachel,"No, what?",10,8
phoebe,"Well, she's going to look all washed out next to the other contestants!",10,8
rachel,"No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!",10,8
phoebe,Why not!,10,8
rachel,Because I already did!,10,8
joey,"Oh, Bob, get off the guy!",10,8
ross,"Oh! What a game, huh?",10,8
joey,"I know, yeah.",10,8
ross,I can't believe Chandler is missing this!,10,8
joey,"Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say,  I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.",10,8
ross,"Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.",10,8
joey,oh! These seats are great!,10,8
ross,"I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice  I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!",10,8
joey,"Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.",10,8
ross,"Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.",10,8
joey,I don't know...,10,8
ross,One more fight!,10,8
joey,Okay.,10,8
ross,Okay.,10,8
monica,Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!,10,8
chandler,I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!,10,8
joey,How late are we?,10,8
ross,Forty-five minutes.,10,8
joey,Wow,10,8
ross,Here!,10,8
joey,"Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!",10,8
ross,You may want to lose the foam finger!,10,8
joey,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!",10,8
ross,Hey!,10,8
phoebe,Oh!,10,8
joey,You are not at Thanksgiving?,10,8
rachel,No...,10,8
phoebe,"No, we're late!",10,8
rachel,What are you doing here!,10,8
ross,We're late too!,10,8
joey,We figured we could be late because you guys were going to be on time,10,8
phoebe,"Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!",10,8
ross,"So, nobody's here? Monica's going to kill us!",10,8
joey,"Yeah, where were you!",10,8
ross,"Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!",10,8

phoebe,And it looks like she put makeup on her!,10,8
joey,"Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...",10,8
ross,"I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of show dog is inexcusable!",10,8
rachel,She won a thousand dollars!,10,8
ross,So this is an annual thing?,10,8
joey,Oh! that is Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!,10,8
phoebe,"You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!",10,8
ross,Yeah. What are we going to do?,10,8
rachel,"Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.",10,8
joey,"All right. Hey Rach, while you are in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.",10,8
phoebe,"Alright, what are we going to say?",10,8
ross,"Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!",10,8
phoebe,"Oh, good, that is good, but you don't look like you were mugged!",10,8
joey,No. Here,10,8
ross,HEY!,10,8
monica,Do you hear something?,10,8
chandler,They're out there!,10,8
monica,"oh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!",10,8
chandler,"Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says ""Rangers"" on it. They went to the game!",10,8
monica,Ooh! They are in for a world of pain!,10,8
chandler,Ross' shirt is torn.,10,8
monica,Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!,10,8
rachel,"Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt?",10,8
ross,I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.,10,8
phoebe,We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this,10,8
ross,That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.,10,8
rachel,"You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.",10,8
ross,We know you are out there.,10,8
joey,Who do you think its from?,10,8
rachel,"Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.",10,8
ross,"Well, let's just go in there and face them.",10,8
phoebe,"Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.",10,8
joey,"I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.",10,8
rachel,"Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first.  Ready? .",10,8
joey,Ah-haah! I win!!,10,8
ross,What is that?,10,8
joey,that is fire. Beats everything.,10,8
phoebe,"Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? .",10,8
joey,"Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.",10,8
rachel,"Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.",10,8
all,"Alright, okay.",10,8
phoebe,It's locked.,10,8
ross,"What...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like",10,8
rachel,"Alright, come on...  Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.",10,8
monica,No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.,10,8
chandler,"Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that...  what happens to cranberry sauce?",10,8
monica,Nothing. It's fine.,10,8
chandler,Oh thank God!,10,8
ross,"Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.",10,8
chandler,"that is a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.",10,8
ross,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!,10,8
rachel,"You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.",10,8
joey,I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.,10,8
monica,that is all the turkey you are going to get.,10,8
ross,How are we going to decide who gets this?,10,8
joey,WATER BALLOON!,10,8
phoebe,What are we going to do? I'm starving.,10,8
rachel,"Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.",10,8
phoebe,Oh yeah!,10,8
monica,"Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.",10,8
chandler,"Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.",10,8
rachel,Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.,10,8
ross,that is worse than no food.,10,8
chandler,HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!,10,8
monica,Stinky?!,10,8
chandler,Please let me stay on this side of the door.,10,8
rachel,"Oh, I know... I still have my old key!  We can just unlock the door.",10,8
phoebe,"Well, I don't know if that is such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.",10,8
rachel,"You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.",10,8
joey,"Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.",10,8
ross,I don't know...,10,8
joey,I'm telling you...  I can do it.,10,8
ross,"Yeah, he can do it!",10,8
rachel,Oh!,10,8
joey,Oh! It all looks so beautiful,10,8
chandler,The cranberries...?,10,8
monica,Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made them!,10,8
joey,"Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.",10,8
chandler,"He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!",10,8
joey,"Come on you guys, we want you to know we're  very very sorry.   Right guys?",10,8
ross,I feel terrible.,10,8
phoebe and rachel,"So, so sorry.",10,8
joey,"Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?",10,8
chandler,The floating heads do make a good point.,10,8
monica,"Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.",10,8
rachel,So bad.,10,8
ross,So bad.,10,8
phoebe,So bad.,10,8
monica,"Okay, okay. You two  go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.",10,8
rachel,Dessert?,10,8
monica,"Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?",10,8
phoebe,"Pies, oh, we thought you said prize . Here! .",10,8
monica,Grand Supreme Little Darling?,10,8
rachel,Congratulations!,10,8
monica,"Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you are an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.",10,8
ross,"Really girls, not cool.",10,8
chandler,"Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.",10,8
joey,Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!,10,8
ross,It's a day to be thankful.,10,8
joey,Don't make me come up there!,10,8
monica,It's too late for apologies.,10,8
joey,Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.,10,8
chandler,That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.,10,8
rachel,"Eww, is that what that is?",10,8
joey,Sorry!,10,8
phoebe,"Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.",10,8
rachel,Yeah! I'll cook!,10,8
ross,Yeah! Let's go out.,10,8
rachel,Hey!,10,8
joey,Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.,10,8
monica,The three of us?,10,8
joey,"Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!",10,8
joey,Ha!,10,8
joey,Oh-oh! I'm stuck!,10,8
monica,"Joey, that is not going to work.",10,8
joey,No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.,10,8
phoebe,I'll pull you through.,10,8
ross,Okay.,10,8
joey,aaw-ah-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.,10,8
chandler,A little late for that.,10,8
joey,"Alright, hurry up, you got to do something.",10,8
monica,"Alright, well, this does not change anything.  Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.",10,8
chandler,"Uhm, we've got turkey grease.",10,8
monica,Bring it.,10,8
joey,I just want to say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a separate person...,10,8
monica,Here you go!,10,8
joey,"Oh, that smells good!",10,8
joey,Okay.,10,8
monica,"Okay, try it.",10,8
joey,It isn't working.,10,8
monica,"Alright, we're going to have to unscrew the chain.",10,8
joey,"Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!",10,8
chandler,Can you ever feel your ears?,10,8
joey,Interesting...,10,8
monica,"Chandler, where are your tools?",10,8
chandler,"Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!",10,8
monica,"I do, but Rachel borrowed them.",10,8
rachel,I lent them to Ross.,10,8
ross,I gave them to Joey.,10,8
joey,I left them at the park.,10,8
monica,Oh!,10,8
ross,I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.,10,8
phoebe,I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.,10,8
ross,Nice!,10,8
monica,"Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.",10,8
joey,It's really starting to hurt.,10,8
chandler,"Okay, look, I'm going to pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!",10,8
phoebe,"Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.",10,8
joey,Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!,10,8
chandler,"Come on guys, PUSH!",10,8
joey,Yeah! Come on!,10,8
joey and chandler,PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!,10,8
chandler,My cranberries!,10,8
joey,"Man, I've got food all over me.",10,8
chandler,Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's going to kill you!,10,8
chandler,Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!,10,8
monica,I don't care.,10,8
chandler,What's going on?,10,8
monica,That was the adoption agency...,10,8
chandler,And?,10,8
monica,WE'RE GETTING A BABY!,10,8
chandler,Are you serious?,10,8
monica,"There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!",10,8
rachel,I'm so happy for you!,10,8
monica,This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!,10,8
rachel,To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.,10,8
ross,I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.,10,8
phoebe,I know. Have you considered pageanting?,10,8
monica,"I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby.",10,8
joey,"Oh, I know how you feel...",10,8
rachel,Really?,10,8
joey,"Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys ""R"" Us... She was in stock!",10,8
chandler,That is the exact same thing.,10,8
ross,Hey!,10,9
monica,Hey!,10,9
chandler,"We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.",10,9
phoebe,"Oh, right! Your adoption interview!",10,9
monica,"Yep, we're going to meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.",10,9
joey,"I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you are going to have a baby! That is so weird!",10,9
chandler,And so incorrect!,10,9
monica,She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's going to like us.,10,9
ross,"Come on, she's going to love you guys!",10,9
chandler,"Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.",10,9
monica,And a lot could still get in our way.,10,9
chandler,"Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..",10,9
phoebe,What are you going to name the baby?,10,9
chandler,I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.,10,9
joey,"But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?",10,9
monica,Oh my God. She's going to pick us!,10,9
chandler,So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?,10,9
monica,"You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're going to have a baby Chandler, a baby!",10,9
chandler,"Yes, but...",10,9
monica,"Oh my God, it's going to WORK! We're going to make it work! I'm going to be a mummy and  you are going to be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm going to get me... A BABY!",10,9
chandler,"Oh, screw it, I'm going to be a daddy!!",10,9
rachel,"Hey, who's Phoebe with?",10,9
joey,I'm going to say someone I'm going to have sex with.   Hey!,10,9
phoebe,Hey!,10,9
joey,So... who's your friend?,10,9
phoebe,"Oh, that is Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!",10,9
joey,"OW, why, why, why?",10,9
phoebe,"Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!",10,9
joey,"Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.",10,9
phoebe,Mandy.,10,9
joey,"Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?",10,9
phoebe,No.,10,9
joey,"I know why I don't remember her, huh?",10,9
rachel,Do you think I'm someone else?,10,9
joey,"Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?",10,9
rachel,"Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!",10,9
joey,Growth!,10,9
phoebe,"Fine, I'll give you her number.",10,9
joey,"Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one.  Mandy.",10,9
phoebe,SARAH!,10,9
joey,Sarah.,10,9
ross,Hey!,10,9
rachel,Hi!,10,9
ross,"Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.",10,9
rachel,Oh!,10,9
ross,How does this look?,10,9
rachel,"Well, it's a little low... pick up a little...  a little bit more...  a little bit more...  There you go!  Now throw it away!",10,9
ross,C'mon! This looks good!,10,9
rachel,"Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.",10,9
ross,Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!,10,9
phoebe,"Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. you are more than welcome to come with us, right?",10,9
ross,"Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kind of teased me about how I dress.",10,9
joey,"I can see why, nice shirt!",10,9
ross,you are wearing the same shirt.,10,9
joey,Stupid Gap on every corner!,10,9
monica,"Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?",10,9
chandler,"Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like",10,9
monica,"Uh, we're going to be great.",10,9
chandler,you are going to be great.,10,9
monica,Well... obviously!,10,9
agency guy,"Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.",10,9
monica,"Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.",10,9
erica,Hi...,10,9
chandler,Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.,10,9
erica,Hi.,10,9
agency guy,I'll let you get acquainted.,10,9
chandler,Ok.,10,9
erica,"So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.",10,9
chandler,that is what our friends call us.,10,9
erica,"Gosh, you know, you are just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.",10,9
monica,I don't know about that.,10,9
erica,"you are kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you are married to a reverend?",10,9
chandler,I don't think that is exactly...,10,9
monica,"Let her finish, doctor.",10,9
joey,Hey.,10,9
phoebe,"Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.",10,9
joey,Well...,10,9
phoebe,Yeah! So you are going to call this one back?,10,9
joey,Nope.,10,9
phoebe,What are you talking about? Sarah's great!,10,9
joey,"Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok?  We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...",10,9
phoebe,"that is it? that is why you won't go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!",10,9
joey,"Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent.",10,9
phoebe,What?,10,9
joey,ALL FOOD!,10,9
phoebe,"I'm sorry, I can't believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!",10,9
joey,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don't order a Garden salad and then eat my food! that is a good way to lose some fingers!",10,9
phoebe,Oh,10,9
rachel,Hi,10,9
phoebe,Thank God you are here. Listen to this!,10,9
rachel,what?,10,9
phoebe,Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...,10,9
rachel,"Oh! Oh, no!",10,9
phoebe,What? You know about the plate thing?,10,9
rachel,"Oh, yeah. Joey doesn't share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...",10,9
phoebe,You wouldn't let her have a grape?,10,9
rachel,Oh no! Not me! Emma!,10,9
joey,JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!,10,9
phoebe,"Well, I still think that it's a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!",10,9
joey,"I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I'll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks.  What were we talking about?",10,9
ross,"You know, we should just go, I'm not going to find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!",10,9
rachel,"Ah, this place is great!",10,9
phoebe,Wow!,10,9
ross,"Rach, come on, I'm not going to wear any of this!  Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair!  And nothing with padlocks on it! .",10,9
rachel,"Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!",10,9
ross,"Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?",10,9
rachel,"Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!",10,9
ross,Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.,10,9
phoebe,"Hey, check this out! It's totally you!",10,9
ross,Wow!,10,9
phoebe,Yeah!,10,9
ross,Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?,10,9
phoebe,What? They will be!,10,9
ross,"All right, that is it, I'm getting out of here.",10,9
rachel,"No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...",10,9
ross,"Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.",10,9
rachel,"Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I'm... I'm going to pick up some really good stuff for you.",10,9
ross,Really?,10,9
rachel,"Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she's going to go nuts for you.",10,9
ross,"So, you are saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?",10,9
rachel,Why do men keep talking to me like this?,10,9
chandler,"So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife's a reverend, that is important to you?",10,9
erica,"Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought who better then a minister to raise a child!",10,9
monica,Amen.,10,9
chandler,Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!,10,9
monica,"Uh, good hands.  Healing hands.",10,9
erica,"Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?",10,9
monica,It says Do it! And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.,10,9
erica,Wow.,10,9
chandler,"Yeah, wow.",10,9
erica,I was wondering you both have such serious jobs.  Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?,10,9
monica,"Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.",10,9
erica,Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.,10,9
chandler,No-ot for me it doesn't.,10,9
agency guy,"So, how's everything going in here?",10,9
erica,"We're great, I think I may have asked all my questions.",10,9
agency guy,Do you have any question for Erica?,10,9
chandler,"Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?",10,9
agency guy,"Yes, our system assures total anonymity. We're very proud of it.",10,9
chandler,You should be. you are really on top of stuff..,10,9
agency guy,"Well, then if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.",10,9
erica,"Actually, I don't think we have to.",10,9
monica,We don't?,10,9
erica,"Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. . I've made my decision. I choose them.",10,9
monica,"Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?",10,9
chandler,"Yeah, I did.",10,9
monica,"Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!",10,9
phoebe,"Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.",10,9
rachel,Oh! Really? Do you want to try some of them on for me?,10,9
phoebe,"Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?",10,9
rachel,"Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by     mistake, and one of mine is missing.",10,9
phoebe,"oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.",10,9
ross,So? What do you think?,10,9
joey,I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!,10,9
ross,Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.,10,9
joey,"Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.",10,9
ross,"Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?",10,9
joey,Looks like someone IS the ladies!!,10,9
ross,"you are just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me  I have a date.  See?  ALL eyes on ME!",10,9
chandler,We are NOT signing those papers.,10,9
monica,Why not?,10,9
chandler,It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.,10,9
monica,God works in mysterious ways.,10,9
chandler,You have got to stop!,10,9
monica,But she liked us.,10,9
chandler,She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.,10,9
monica,"Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.",10,9
chandler,"Your Veal Chop is $34,95!",10,9
monica,"C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.",10,9
chandler,But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?,10,9
monica,Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.,10,9

monica,I-Is... Is that a picture?,10,9
erica,Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.,10,9
monica,"Look, doctor!",10,9
agency guy,I don't understand.,10,9
chandler,The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.,10,9
erica,What?,10,9
agency guy,that is impossible.,10,9
chandler,I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.,10,9
agency guy,I'll go check your file. Excuse me.,10,9
erica,So who are you?,10,9
chandler,"Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.",10,9
monica,"Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.",10,9
erica,So you lied to me before?,10,9
monica,"Well, we...  ""bore false witness""... See I could be a reverend.",10,9
erica,I can't believe this.,10,9
monica,But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...,10,9
erica,Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?,10,9
monica,"Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...",10,9
erica,I don't want to look at your file! This is over.,10,9
chandler,Erica wait!,10,9
erica,I've nothing to say to you.,10,9
chandler,You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's going to be before we can get another chance again.,10,9
erica,Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?,10,9
chandler,"Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.",10,9
erica,"Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.",10,9
chandler,"But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?",10,9
chandler,You still want that baby?,10,9
monica,God bless you Chandler Bing!,10,9

monica,Sex!,10,10
chandler,"Seriously, answer faster!",10,10
monica,"Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said ""sex"" I wasn't thinking about ""sex with you""!",10,10
chandler,It's like a giant hug.,10,10

rachel,"No, you are not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!",10,10
phoebe,"Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!  See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!",10,10
rachel,"Oh, that doesn't mean anything.",10,10

joey,"Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?",10,10
monica,"Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously...  Did you think the neighbourhood was homey?",10,10
chandler,Hey!,10,10
joey,You son of a bitch!,10,10
chandler,"Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?",10,10
monica,Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you are having an affair.,10,10

monica,"Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.",10,10
joey,What?,10,10

monica,"When we found out that we're going to get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.",10,10
phoebe,So you are going to move?,10,10
ross,Oh my God.,10,10
joey,Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!,10,10
rachel,"What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!",10,10
monica,"And that is great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swing set...",10,10
chandler,...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.,10,10
ross,So you want to buy a house in the 50's?,10,10
phoebe,"Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?",10,10
ross,"You know what, if you want to look for a house, that is okay.",10,10
joey,"No, no, it's not, don't listen to him!  I'm going to thump you!",10,10
ross,"It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you are going to realize, this is the only place, you want to be.",10,10
chandler,"Actually, we already found a house we love.",10,10
ross,What?,10,10
monica,"And about an hour ago, we made an offer.",10,10
chandler,"Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?",10,10
ross,You put an offer on a house?,10,10
monica,It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...,10,10
phoebe,"Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?",10,10
chandler,I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.,10,10
joey,"Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?  Because I can stop doing that,  I really, really think I can!",10,10
chandler,You know that is not the reason Joe.,10,10
monica,"We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there.  It is beautiful, isn't it?",10,10
rachel,Yeah it is.,10,10
joey,What the hell are you doin'?,10,10

rachel,"C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you are a shoe! you are a shoe, you are a shoe, you are a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't want to be a shoe? What if I want to be a- a purse, you know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!",10,10

chandler,"Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",10,10

missy,Sorry.,10,11
ross,"that is ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kind of made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!",10,11

phoebe,I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.,10,11
roy,"Well, look - it's not my fault if you are too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.",10,11
phoebe,"Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that is why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child Halloween costume!",10,11

ross,Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.,10,11
monica,Oh my God! that is wild!,10,11
chandler,"Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.",10,11
ross,"Well, it matters to me.",10,11
chandler,Why?,10,11
ross,Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.,10,11
chandler,You kissed her that night too?,10,11
monica,"Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.",10,11
chandler,"Seriously, where did this happen?",10,11
ross,"Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.",10,11
chandler,Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?,10,11
ross,Mine.,10,11
chandler,I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.,10,11
ross,"No, she was definitely on my bed.",10,11
chandler,"Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?",10,11
ross,"Well, then who was on my bed?",10,11
monica,"OH! Oh, oh!",10,11
ross,"NO! No, no!",10,11
monica,YES!,10,11
ross,You were under the pile of coats?,10,11
monica,I was the pile of coats!,10,11
ross,OH MY GOD!,10,11
monica,You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?,10,11
ross,You were my first kiss with Rachel?,10,11
monica,You were my first kiss ever?,10,11
chandler,What did I marry into?,10,11
monica,"Oh, crap!",10,11
phoebe,"Oh, hey Joey.",10,12
joey,"Uh, hey.",10,12
phoebe,"Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.",10,12
joey,Yeah.,10,12
phoebe,"Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.",10,12
joey,So he can't come?,10,12
phoebe,"No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.",10,12
joey,Seriously?,10,12
phoebe,"Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...",10,12
joey,I am pretty wisdomous.,10,12
phoebe,So... what do you say?,10,12
joey,"Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honoured.",10,12
phoebe,"Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.",10,12
joey,"Listen, I hope... that you know...  I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!",10,12
joey,"Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.",10,12
phoebe,"Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy!  Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!",10,12
monica,"Well, it matters to me!",10,12
phoebe,"Well, I don't care, so you pick!",10,12
monica,"Did you just hung up on me?  All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.",10,12
phoebe,Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.,10,12
monica,You don't know military time?,10,12
phoebe,"Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.",10,12
monica,Just subtract twelve.,10,12
phoebe,"Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...",10,12
monica,Six o'clock!,10,12
phoebe,Ok.,10,12
monica,"Ok. Hold on.  Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye.  Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?",10,12
phoebe,Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.,10,12
monica,"Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I want to make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.",10,12
phoebe,What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.,10,12
monica,Ooh... she backed out.,10,12
phoebe,She did? Why?,10,12
monica,"I made her.  Steel drums don't really say ""elegant wedding"". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.",10,12
phoebe,Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.,10,12
chandler,Hey!,10,12
phoebe,Hey!,10,12
chandler,"You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.",10,12
phoebe,"Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?",10,12
chandler,No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.,10,12
phoebe,Rehearse it!,10,12
ross,Hi!,10,12
mike,Thanks for coming you guys.,10,12
ross,"Oh,  hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.",10,12
mike,Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?,10,12
ross,That is why!,10,12
mike,Yeah.,10,12
phoebe,So Rach.,10,12
rachel,Yeah.,10,12
phoebe,Where is Emma?,10,12
rachel,"Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.",10,12
monica,"Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you got to keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!",10,12
joey,"Hey, you are Mike's parents, right?",10,12
mike's mother,"Yes, we are.",10,12
joey,"Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?",10,12
mike's father,How's that?,10,12
joey,"You know, on the one hand you are happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.",10,12
mike's father,Who in God's name are you?,10,12
joey,"Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!",10,12
chandler,You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.,10,12
ross,"Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?",10,12
rachel,Uh... November?,10,12
ross,I want to say it's not looking good.,10,12
rachel,Hey Pheebs...,10,12
phoebe,What's up?,10,12
rachel,Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.,10,12
chandler,Heh.,10,12
phoebe,"Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.",10,12
ross,What?,10,12
rachel,"Well, this is really awkward  Oh, and I can leave!",10,12
phoebe,"I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.",10,12
ross,"Oh, man!",10,12
chandler,This is like figure skating team all over again.  I mean synchronized swimming.  I mean- I mean the balance beam.  Help me!,10,12
ross,FOOTBALL!,10,12
chandler,Thank you.,10,12
monica,"Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.",10,12
phoebe,Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!,10,12
monica,"Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!",10,12
phoebe,I don't have a fax machine.,10,12
monica,"Ah, well then there are going to be a few surprises!",10,12
ross,I can't believe we're going to be the only people that aren't in this wedding.,10,12
chandler,"I know, I hate being left out of things.",10,12
ross,And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...,10,12
mike,"Hey guys, how is it going?",10,12
chandler,Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.,10,12
mike,"Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for you. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.",10,12
chandler,What happened?,10,12
ross,"Who cares, AND?",10,12
mike,"...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys...",10,12
ross,I'll do it!,10,12
chandler,M-Me-me-me!,10,12
mike,You both want to do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.,10,12
chandler,"Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.",10,12
ross,"No, Mike, no, no. You want to pick me, I mean... watch!  Huh?",10,12
mike,"You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm going to let her choose.",10,12
ross,"Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.",10,12
chandler,"Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!",10,12
ross,"Please, you are going down!",10,12
chandler,You are going downer!,10,12
ross,Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?,10,12
chandler,"I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!",10,12
joey,"So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?",10,12
mike,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.",10,12
joey,"Oh, hey, my pleasure.  So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?",10,12
mike,I intend to marry her.,10,12
joey,"Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?",10,12
mike,No more so than acting.,10,12
joey,Strike two!,10,12
mike,"you are right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?",10,12
joey,"Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!",10,12
ross,"So, what did you decide?",10,12
phoebe,I decided to pee.,10,12
chandler,Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.,10,12
phoebe,"Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!",10,12
chandler,Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.,10,12
phoebe,"Oh, I don't want to choose! It's . Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.",10,12
rachel,"Goody, what is it!",10,12
phoebe,"Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.",10,12
rachel,"What, what, what, no, I don't want to do that.",10,12
phoebe,"All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.",10,12
ross,I'll do it!,10,12
monica,"Ok, it's 2100 hours.  Time for your toast.",10,12
mike,Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?,10,12
monica,"You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you want to keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!",10,12
mike,Is that what you say to Chandler?,10,12
monica,"It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.",10,12
phoebe,"Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. . My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I...  oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because...  it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and  but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I want to take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...",10,12
monica,oh God.,10,12
phoebe,"And... moment's over!  So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm...  Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I . Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS  OR THIS  OR THIS  OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS!  You know what? you are done.",10,12
monica,What?,10,12
phoebe,you are FIRED!   Cheers!,10,12
phoebe,Hey!,10,12
rachel,Happy wedding day!,10,12
phoebe,"Oh, happy my wedding day to you!",10,12
rachel,"Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is going to be bridesmaid central, all right? We're going to have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.",10,12
joey,"Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!",10,12
monica,"Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.",10,12
phoebe,"Oh, well that is ok. I think you and I will do much better if you are just... here as a bridesmaid.",10,12
monica,"Oh, is that so? Ok. If that is really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you are taking over, you should probably return these messages.",10,12
phoebe,"Wow, this is a lot!",10,12
monica,"Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.",10,12
phoebe,You won awards?,10,12
monica,Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.,10,12
ross,Hey!,10,12
monica,Hi.,10,12
ross,Where's Rach?,10,12
monica,"She's in her room, why?",10,12
ross,"I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not going to watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! .  Oh! My God! you are breath taking!",10,12
rachel,What d'you want?,10,12
ross,"You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?",10,12
rachel,"Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!",10,12
ross,I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!,10,12
rachel,"Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!",10,12
ross,"Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is going to walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's going to be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!",10,12
rachel,"Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!",10,12
ross,"YES, YES!",10,12
phoebe,Sven I don't understand what you are saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?,10,12
monica,I know.,10,12
mike,Hey.,10,12
phoebe,"Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word ""lorkins"" what flowers would that be?",10,12
mike,Orchids?,10,12
phoebe,Right there! that is why I'm marrying you!,10,12
joey,Hello Michael.,10,12
mike,Joseph.,10,12
joey,"May I have a word with you, please?",10,12
mike,This is... great...,10,12
joey,"Have a seat.  Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me...  I cannot allow this.",10,12
mike,Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?,10,12
joey,"More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for ""Family Honor 2",10,12
mike,"Joey, I kind of have a lot to do today, what do you want?",10,12
joey,"I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I want to make sure that you are going to take care of her.",10,12
mike,"Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.",10,12
joey,"that is what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you are going to be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.",10,12
mike,That must have been one lousy movie.,10,12
joey,That was ME!,10,12
rachel,Hi,10,12
chandler,"Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!",10,12
rachel,"Even so, I think I'm going to pick Ross.",10,12
chandler,"Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are going to come rushing back.",10,12
rachel,"All right fine, I pick you.",10,12
chandler,"Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make ""groom"" for Chandler.",10,12
rachel,Oh my...,10,12
phoebe,"No! We're going to do it my way.  Because your way is stupid! Alright I got to go, I have another call, Reverend.  Hello?",10,12
joey,I'm glad we had this little talk.,10,12
mike,"Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice.  That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?",10,12
phoebe,Okay.,10,12
monica,Bye.,10,12
mike,"Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?",10,12
phoebe,"Oh my God, what's it doing here?",10,12
monica,"Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address.  Uh! What a pickle.",10,12
phoebe,"Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?",10,12
joey,How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?,10,12
chandler,How's it going?,10,12
ross,Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.,10,12
chandler,that is what I was doing too.,10,12
ross,"Well, you have fun tonight.",10,12
chandler,You too.,10,12
ross,"Oh, I will.",10,12
chandler,Me too.,10,12
ross,"Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?",10,12
chandler,I'm not supposed to tell you.,10,12
ross,I'm not supposed to tell you!,10,12
chandler,You told us both we could be in the wedding?,10,12
rachel,"Well, in my defence, you were not supposed to tell each other.",10,12
ross,"Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.",10,12
chandler,"Rach, Rach, knock knock.",10,12
rachel,Who's there?,10,12
chandler,I'll tell you at the wedding.,10,12
rachel,Uh.,10,12
mike,"Hey, I forgot my scarf.",10,12
rachel,"You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.",10,12
mike,"Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, Because I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.",10,12
ross,What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.,10,12
rachel,"Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm going to have to go with the dog.",10,12
phoebe,"Alright, wait, so what you are saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?",10,12
monica,How's it going?,10,12
phoebe,Help me.,10,12
monica,What?,10,12
phoebe,I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.,10,12
monica,Really?,10,12
phoebe,Please?,10,12
monica,You really want me to come back?,10,12
phoebe,More than I want to get married.,10,12
monica,"Ok people, we are back in business!  Oh God, we've missed you so much!  Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.",10,12
joey,"Hey, what are you guys going to do?",10,12
phoebe,About what?,10,12
joey,"The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.",10,12
monica,Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!,10,12
joey,I don't think they are.,10,12
ross,Haha! Looks like you are not going to be in the wedding either.  So sorry Pheebs.,10,12
monica,"Well, the club lost it's power.",10,12
joey,"Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.",10,12
rachel,Since when do you watch the news?,10,12
joey,"Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.",10,12
ross,I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.,10,12
phoebe,I know.,10,12
rachel,"Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?",10,12
phoebe,What?,10,12
rachel,"Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!",10,12
phoebe,What do you think?,10,12
mike,I think I want to get married to you today.,10,12
phoebe,"Me too!  Monica, do you think we could do it?",10,12
monica,AFFIRMATIVE!,10,12
monica,"OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights.  Okay, who left the ice sculpture  ON THE STEAM GRATE?",10,12
mike's mom,Michael!,10,12
mike,"Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi!  Hi!  Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of...",10,12
mike's mom,No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.,10,12
mike's dad,"I crushed a pill and put it in her drink...  Come on, sweetheart.",10,12
mike,"You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's going to have to walk him down the aisle.",10,12
chandler,"So technically, would this person be in the wedding?",10,12
mike,I guess.,10,12
chandler,I'll do it!,10,12
ross,"No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?",10,12
chandler,I'm not scared.  I'll just take little Chappy and...  HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.,10,12
ross,"Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa...  He stinks!",10,12
monica,"Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.",10,12
mike,"Oh, no!",10,12
joey,"Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.",10,12
monica,Really?,10,12
joey,"Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...",10,12
ross,"Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.",10,12
joey,"I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.",10,12
monica,"Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.",10,12
chandler,I'll do it.,10,12
ross,I'll...,10,12
chandler,Na ha ha...  Ne he he...  Ah ah...,10,12
monica,"Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.",10,12
monica,"Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.",10,12
phoebe,"Oh, okay. Hi new dad.",10,12
monica,"So, you are ready to do this?",10,12
phoebe,"Uhh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.",10,12
rachel,"Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.",10,12
phoebe,"Oh, thank you.",10,12
monica,"I love you.  Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell.",10,12
phoebe,I love you guys.,10,12
rachel and monica,I love you.,10,12
monica,Okay.  It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count.  Let's get this bad boy on the road.,10,12
chandler,Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?,10,12

phoebe,Na-ah.,10,12
joey,"Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm going to do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?",10,12
joey,Okay...,10,12
phoebe,"When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever going to need... You are my family.",10,12
mike,"Phoebe you are so beautiful. you are so kind, you are so generous. you are so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever.",10,12

joey,"Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?",10,12
phoebe,I do.,10,12
joey,"Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?",10,12
mike,I do.,10,12
joey,I now pronounce you... husband and wife.,10,12
phoebe,"I got married!  Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.",10,12
chandler,That really was an incredible wedding.,10,12
joey,"It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you want to come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?",10,12
chandler,"I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.",10,12
joey,"Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?",10,12
chandler,I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.,10,12
ross,"Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.",10,12
phoebe,Hi,10,13
all,Hey! Hi!,10,13
rachel,How was the honeymoon?,10,13
rachel,Oh!,10,13
chandler,"So, where's Mike?",10,13
phoebe,"Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!",10,13
joey,"Well anyway, I'm glad you are back, I really need your help.",10,13
phoebe,"Oh, why? What's up?",10,13
joey,"I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my resume, I'm fluent in.",10,13
ross,"Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.",10,13
monica,"Yeah, you really shouldn't.  By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?",10,13
ross,It was ok...,10,13
rachel,I did not know you spoke French.,10,13
phoebe,"Oui, bien sur je parle Francois! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?",10,13
rachel,Oh... you are so sexy!,10,13
joey,"Well, so, will you help me? I really want to be in this play.",10,13
phoebe,"Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.",10,13
rachel,"Seriously stop it, or I'm going to jump on you.",10,13
chandler,Hey.,10,13
monica,Hey.,10,13
chandler,Why are you wearing my apron?,10,13
monica,"I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.",10,13
chandler,"Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as ""my wife"" and ""the woman who's carrying my child""?  No? Divorce?",10,13
ross,Hey.,10,13
monica,Hey.,10,13
ross,You guys know where Rachel is?,10,13
monica,"No, we haven't seen her since this morning.",10,13
ross,So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.,10,13
monica,Hey!,10,13
ross,Hey!,10,13
monica,These are for Erica!,10,13
ross,What? She's going to eat all those cookies?,10,13
monica,"Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!",10,13
ross,"So, why is Erica coming to visit?",10,13
monica,"Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...",10,13
chandler,"Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes ""Mooooo""!",10,13
monica,"Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?",10,13
ross,"Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!",10,13
rachel,Ross...,10,13
ross,"No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?",10,13
rachel,My father had an heart attack...  ...while I was at Barney's.,10,13
ross,Oh my God.,10,13
monica,Honey.,10,13
chandler,I'm so sorry...,10,13
ross,Is-is he ok?,10,13
rachel,"Yeah, they said he's going to be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.",10,13
ross,"Ok, ok. I'm going to come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.",10,13
rachel,"No, come on, I'm totally ok.  I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.",10,13
ross,"Still-still, let me come... for me.",10,13
rachel,Ok. If you really need to.,10,13
ross,I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.,10,13
rachel,"Oh, I really could.",10,13
ross,Oh!,10,13
rachel,Ohh...,10,13
phoebe,"All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is ""My name is Claude"", so, just repeat after me. ""Je m'appelle Claude"".",10,13
joey,Je de coup Clow.,10,13

chandler,"Monica. Calm, self.",10,13
erica,"Thank you. It's really nice to meet you guys, I can't believe I'm here!",10,13
joey,"Welcome to New York City! Or should I say ""ghe deu flooff New York City""?",10,13
chandler,Why would you say that?,10,13
phoebe,Ok. What are you going to be doing today?,10,13
erica,"I want to see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...",10,13
joey,"Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.",10,13
erica,"Oh yeah, let's do that!",10,13
chandler,Great!  This baby'd better to be really good.,10,13

ross,And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.,10,13
rachel,"Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.",10,13
rachel,Can somebody please go in?,10,13
nurse,Absolutely.,10,13
ross,"Rach, I think I'm going to wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.",10,13
rachel,"Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!",10,13
ross,"I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!",10,13
nurse,"He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.",10,13
ross,I'm feeling better.,10,13
rachel,"Oh!  Oh! Oh my God! oh, oh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?",10,13
nurse,"Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.",10,13
rachel,"Oh, great, Are you going to be ok?",10,13
ross,"He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!",10,13
rachel,Ok.,10,13
ross,Did the TV wake you?,10,13
dr. green,"No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter.",10,13
ross,Ouchy.,10,13
dr. green,"What are you doing here, Geller?",10,13
ross,"Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second!  So what's new?",10,13
dr. green,"Ooh, I have a little heart attack.",10,13
ross,"Right, is it painful?",10,13
dr. green,"What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?",10,13
dr. green,"So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?",10,13
ross,"Nope, just the one. RACH!",10,13
phoebe,Je m'appelle Claude.,10,13
joey,Je do call blue!,10,13
phoebe,"Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. ""je"".",10,13
joey,je.,10,13
phoebe,m'ap,10,13
joey,mah,10,13

ross,Hey!,10,13
rachel,Hi!,10,13
ross,I was going to make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream.  I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.,10,13
rachel,Uh.  Did you call your parents?,10,13
ross,"Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.",10,13
rachel,Oh good.,10,13
ross,Wow.,10,13
rachel,What?,10,13
ross,Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.,10,13
rachel,What do you mean? You've been in my room before!,10,13
ross,"Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.",10,13
rachel,"Ok I got to tell you, it's really weird when you use my whole name.",10,13
ross,Sorry. . You ok?,10,13
rachel,Yeah.,10,13
ross,"You had a rough day, uh?",10,13
rachel,"Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!",10,13
ross,"But we do!  It's going to be ok, Rach!",10,13
rachel,Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!,10,13
ross,"What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...",10,13
rachel,What?,10,13
ross,"They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?",10,13
rachel,"Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?",10,13
ross,"No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.",10,13
rachel,"Ok, maybe you are right.",10,13
ross,Good night.,10,13
rachel,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?",10,13
ross,Sure!,10,13
rachel,Ok.  Thank you for coming with me today.,10,13
ross,"Oh, of course...",10,13
rachel,Rachel Green is very happy you are in her room!,10,13
ross,Me too. Come here.,10,13
rachel,I just don't want to be alone tonight.,10,13
ross,"Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.",10,13
rachel,"Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?",10,13
ross,"No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you are feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.",10,13
rachel,"Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!",10,13
ross,"Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm going to go!",10,13
rachel,Wow. Ok.,10,13
ross,I'll see you in the morning .,10,13
rachel,Mhm-mh!,10,13
ross,"Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!",10,13
erica,Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.,10,13
monica,"Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.",10,13
chandler,New York is awesome!,10,13
monica,What is with you?,10,13
chandler,"Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.",10,13
monica,"Yeah, you miss a lot, when you are moo-ing.",10,13
erica,Thanks so much for showing me around.,10,13
monica,Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.,10,13
erica,"Well, if there is anything else you want to know...",10,13
chandler,"Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?",10,13
erica,"Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.",10,13
chandler,that is great.,10,13
erica,Yeah... it's almost definitely him.,10,13
monica,How's that now?,10,13
erica,"Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sort of overlapped.",10,13
chandler,"So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?",10,13
erica,"No, he's in prison.",10,13
monica,Was he falsely accused of something?,10,13
erica,"No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.",10,13
chandler,I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.,10,13
monica,Are you awake?,10,13
chandler,Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!,10,13
monica,"Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.",10,13
chandler,"Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.",10,13
monica,"Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?",10,13
chandler,I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.,10,13
monica,How?,10,13
chandler,"I don't know, aren't there tests for these things, right?",10,13
monica,"Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.",10,13
chandler,"Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm!",10,13
tape,"We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.",10,13
joey,"Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!",10,13
tape,Good job.,10,13
joey,Thank you.,10,13
phoebe,Hey Joey.,10,13
joey,Hey!,10,13
phoebe,"Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.",10,13
joey,"Oh, no, that is okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I got to say, I am pretty good!",10,13
phoebe,"Really, can I hear some of it.",10,13
joey,"Sure, sure. Ok,  ""Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu""  See?",10,13
phoebe,"Well, you are not,  you are not... you are not... again, you are not SPEAKING FRENCH!",10,13
joey,"Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely going to get the part.",10,13
phoebe,How could you possibly think that?,10,13
joey,"For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!",10,13
ross,"Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?",10,13
rachel,Sure.,10,13
ross,You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?,10,13
rachel,Hmm-hmm.,10,13
ross,You sure you are alright?,10,13
rachel,Yep.,10,13
ross,"O-kay. Well, I'm going to go grab us some breakfast.",10,13
rachel,FYI..,10,13
ross,There it is...,10,13
rachel,"In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.",10,13
ross,"Wait, wait,  you are mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.",10,13
rachel,"Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!",10,13
ross,Well...,10,13
rachel,Oh stop that!,10,13
ross,I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.,10,13
rachel,"Oh, that is so hot.",10,13
ross,"Hey, I was looking out for you.",10,13
rachel,"Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.",10,13
ross,"I got to say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.",10,13
rachel,"Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.",10,13
ross,"Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.",10,13
rachel,What?,10,13
ross,"that is right, sex is off the table.  I am never having sex with you again.  Dr. Green, are you feeling better?",10,13
chandler,Hey! How was lunch?,10,13
erica,"We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob",10,13
chandler,"Oh, really?",10,13
erica,"No!  You we're right, that was fun! I'm going to go finish packing.",10,13
chandler,"O-okay.  So, is she going to take the test?",10,13
monica,"Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.",10,13
chandler,"Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?",10,13
monica,No it's not.,10,13
chandler,How do you know?,10,13
erica,"Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.",10,13
chandler,Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?,10,13
monica,The thing we never do.,10,13
chandler,Shovely Joe!,10,13
director,Whenever you are ready Joey.,10,13
joey,"Right.  Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.",10,13
casting assistant,"I'm sorry, what's going on?",10,13
joey,"Dude, come on! French it u-up!",10,13
director,"Joey, do you speak French?",10,13
joey,Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!,10,13
director,You know what. I think this audition is over.,10,13
phoebe,"Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Regine Phalange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estee Lauder.",10,13
director,You really think this man is speaking French?,10,13
joey,Sa-sa-saw!,10,13
phoebe,"Listen, I will tell you the truth. He's my little bother. He's a bit retarded",10,13
phoebe,"So, would you please just humour him?",10,13
director,"Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're going to go with someone else for the part.",10,13
joey,Ah. All right. But my French was good?,10,13
director,It was great.,10,13
joey,Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!,10,13
phoebe,Merci. Au revoir.,10,13
joey,Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.,10,13
ross,Emma's down for the night.,10,13
rachel,"Oh, good.",10,13
ross,So uh... I guess I want to take off.,10,13
rachel,"Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just want to say ""thank you"" for coming with me.",10,13
ross,"Oh, no problem.",10,13
rachel,"And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.",10,13
ross,Thank you. I'm glad you agree.,10,13
rachel,"It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.",10,13
ross,"Yeah... Yeah, that is true.",10,13
rachel,"Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?",10,13
ross,"Oh, ye-ah!",10,13
rachel,You know it was you are uhm... birthday...,10,13
ross,...Valentine's day...,10,13
both,Oh yeah!,10,13
rachel,"Well, I guess that is all in the past, now.",10,13
ross,Hmmm-mmmm.,10,13
rachel,Not even one more time?,10,13
ross,Not even once.,10,13
rachel,No matter how much we want it.,10,13
ross,Even if we want it really bad.,10,13
rachel,that is what we decided.,10,13
ross,"Uhm, right!",10,13
rachel,...It's kind of hard though!,10,13
ross,Yeah.,10,13
rachel,"You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that is... just seems like such a... waste.",10,13
ross,...I hate waste.,10,13
rachel,...Ross?,10,13
ross,Yes?,10,13
rachel,Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.,10,13
ross,Damn it. It's never off the table.,10,13
phoebe,"Okay, can you really tapdance?",10,13
joey,No.,10,13
phoebe,It's off the resume.,10,13
phoebe,Archery?,10,13
joey,No.,10,13
phoebe,Horseback riding?,10,13
joey,Would fall off a lot.,10,13

phoebe,Where did you go to do it?,10,14
monica,Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...,10,14
chandler,YOU NEVER DID IT!,10,14

mike,Here you go.,10,14
phoebe,"Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?",10,14

chandler,"Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.",10,14

phoebe,Good for you. That was really mature.,10,14
joey,"What? No, the only reason  I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that is wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm going to make them stay here.",10,14
mike,you are a strange kind of grown-up.,10,14
phoebe,"Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...",10,14
mike,Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?,10,14
phoebe,"All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not going to talk them into staying here.",10,14
joey,"Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that ""thing"". What is it?",10,14
joey,I AM NOT going to HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!,10,14
rachel,"Hi, I'm here to see Mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.",10,14

mr campbell,Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resume.,10,14
rachel,Whatever happened to just singing for  no reason? Huh?,10,14

clerk,You need to fill out this form.,10,14

phoebe,"Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.",10,14
monica,"Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.",10,14
phoebe,"Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.",10,14
chandler,that is what we were going to name the baby.,10,14
monica,Phoebe!,10,14
phoebe,Uh! Princess Consuela.,10,14

chandler,"You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.",10,14
rachel,"Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.",10,14
chandler,That is a bad interview.,10,14
phoebe,"What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?",10,14
rachel,"Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's going to have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said ""Wait a minute! Yes I am."" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.",10,14
monica,Oh God. I'm so sorry.,10,14
ross,"Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this?  Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?",10,14

monica,But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.,10,14
ross,...that centre around work.,10,14
chandler,To Ross!,10,14
chandler joey ross monica phoebe,Ross!,10,14
ross,You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.,10,14

monica,"Ah, so glad you decided to come.",10,14
joey,"Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.",10,14
chandler,What?,10,14
joey,Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.,10,14
monica,No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.,10,14
joey,Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.,10,14
monica,Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.,10,14
joey,"Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.",10,14
monica,No it's not!,10,14
joey,Are you kidding'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!,10,14
chandler,"When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?",10,14
joey,"Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.",10,14
monica,"Oh Joey, look, we know you are having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.",10,14
joey,"FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound.  Hmm...",10,14
monica,"Joey, we know that is you.",10,14

joey,"What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing,    okay? First, Phoebe getting married  Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid    suburbs...",10,15
monica,"Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...",10,15
joey,"Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.",10,15
rachel,"Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means    a lot if you could try to get on board.",10,15
phoebe,Of course we can. Congratulations.     Yay!  Joey...,10,15
joey,"No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.",10,15
rachel,"Joey, it would mean so...",10,15
joey,Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.,10,15
rachel,Joey...,10,15
phoebe,You okay with this?,10,15
chandler,"Well, it makes me feel sad, but...",10,15
phoebe,Talking to Ross.,10,15
chandler,I see.,10,15
ross,"Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every    day. How can I be okay with this?",10,15
monica,"I know, but what are we going to do? She really needs this job.",10,15
ross,"Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back,    she would take it?",10,15
monica,How is that going to happen?,10,15
chandler,Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?,10,15
ross,I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas    party. We really hit it off.,10,15
monica,You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?,10,15
ross,I didn't say we were brothers.,10,15
monica,"Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next    door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I want to    take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.",10,15
chandler,"We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse    us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.",10,15
monica,But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?,10,15
chandler,What do you think Pheebs?,10,15
phoebe,"Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin    Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?",10,15
chandler,Yeah.,10,15
phoebe,She died.,10,15
chandler,you are kidding!,10,15
monica,that is terrible!,10,15
phoebe,"Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across    the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the    wrong one.",10,15
chandler,Oh yeah?,10,15
phoebe,"Yeah, she was just an agent.",10,15
monica,Joey's going to be *so* upset.,10,15
chandler,I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the    Atlantic.,10,15
phoebe,"Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about    everything that is changing. This will push him over the edge.",10,15
monica,"Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?",10,15
phoebe,"Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get    used to everything else.",10,15
monica,What if he reads it in the paper?,10,15
chandler,"Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.",10,15
ross,"Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas    party about two years ago.",10,15
mr zelner,"Oh right, uhm, Don?",10,15
ross,Close. Ron.,10,15
mr zelner,Uh... What can I do for you?,10,15
ross,"Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.",10,15
mr zelner,"Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?",10,15
ross,"Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll    see if she wants to come back.",10,15
mr zelner,"Wow, that is tempting.",10,15
ross,"Look, she loved her job here. And let's face    it",10,15
mr zelner,She is good!,10,15
ross,"Huh, I took a shot there.",10,15
mr zelner,"But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah,    it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.",10,15
ross,I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son?,10,15
mr zelner,"Yeah, his name is Ross.  What?",10,15
ross,"Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does    little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?",10,15
mr zelner,"Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?",10,15
ross,"How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after    everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants.    . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that is    not good. Let me start again. I'm a palaeontologist, you'll be there    with us and the touching refers only to bones fossils!",10,15
mr zelner,You can really arrange that?,10,15
ross,"You let Rachel come back, and it's done.",10,15
mr zelner,"Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing    in the world.",10,15
ross,"Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear,    your kid is going to have the time of his life.",10,15
mr zelner,"that is great. I worry about little Ross. He's always    reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.",10,15
ross,He'll be fine.,10,15
joey,Hey Phoebe.,10,15
phoebe,Hey. Everything ok?,10,15
joey,I'm just mad at my agent.,10,15
phoebe,Estelle? Why?,10,15
joey,There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I    didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason.,10,15
phoebe,I'm guessing she does.,10,15
phoebe,"Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I got to go. Just listen. Promise me, that you    will wait a minute before you call her.",10,15
joey,Ok. Why?,10,15
phoebe,Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.,10,15
joey,I love that saying!,10,15
joey,Hello?,10,15
phoebe,"Joey, it's Estelle.",10,15
joey,I was just going to call you! that is weird.,10,15
phoebe,"It's a little coincidental, but believable.    . Listen, I'm sure you are wondering why    I didn't get you an audition for that TV movie.",10,15
joey,"Yeah, actually I am!",10,15
phoebe,I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!,10,15
joey,"that is it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.",10,15
phoebe,"Don't take that tone with me. Who you    think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?",10,15
joey,"No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you are my agent, ok?    And you are not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it.",10,15
phoebe,What are you saying?,10,15
joey,"I'm saying that. This isn't  working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you are fired. Goodbye. .",10,15
phoebe,"Man, tough week for Estelle!",10,15
ross,Hi.,10,15
rachel,Hi.,10,15
ross,Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep    without it.,10,15
rachel,"Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.",10,15
ross,Ok.,10,15
rachel,"Oh, you are not going to believe what happened to me today! Ralph    Lauren called, and gave me my job back!",10,15
ross,No!,10,15
rachel,"Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out    of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling    apart without me.",10,15
ross,"So, you are not going to Paris.",10,15
rachel,"No, I'm still going.",10,15
ross,Wh wh what?,10,15
rachel,"When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,    the offered me more money! Isn't that great?",10,15
ross,Yeah!,10,15
lady,"Oh, sure. I'm showing it to someone else right now,    but please, look around.",10,15
monica,Thanks.,10,15
chandler,"It feels like we're cheating on our house.    And if we're going to cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house,    that does stuff that our house won't do?",10,15
monica,"Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks    like a cave! What a hole!",10,15
lady,So? What do you think?,10,15
monica,Love it!,10,15
lady,"Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady    upstairs is going to make another one.",10,15
monica,"They could be our neighbours, what are they like?",10,15
lady,"Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids,    he's on Wall Street and she-",10,15
janice,Oh my God!,10,15
chandler,Sure.,10,15
phoebe,"Hey Joey, want come with me to- are you ok?",10,15
joey,"Yeah, I just- I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be    killing her.",10,15
phoebe,"No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.",10,15
joey,"I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like    her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing    he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but    she did stick with me for ten years. I'm going to call her and hire her again.",10,15
phoebe,"No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call    you",10,15
joey,Why?,10,15
phoebe,Because patience is the road to understanding  which ...    is the key... to a happy heart.,10,15
joey,You blow me away.,10,15
phoebe,"All right, so promise you are going to wait for her    to call you?",10,15
joey,"I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.",10,15
chandler,And yet I never run into Beyonce!,10,15
realtor,You two know each other?,10,15
janice,"Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man    out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we going to    have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie",10,15
chandler,"Don't, don't!",10,15
monica,"No, actually, we're buying the house next door.",10,15
chandler,Why!?,10,15
monica,I don't know    why.,10,15
janice,"Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence.    But knowing that you two would be our neighbours? Ah! now we have to    get it!  Ellen, we're going to talk    numbers.",10,15
chandler,This can not be happening!,10,15
monica,"Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer.    Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.",10,15
chandler,"The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple    are the Hitlers.",10,15
monica,"Okay, Okay,     All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house    into a guest house.",10,15
chandler,"That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful,    but when did you start crapping money!?",10,15
monica,"Okay, you come up with an idea.",10,15
chandler,"Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on    our house. We can still get out.",10,15
monica,But we love our house.,10,15
chandler,"Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's going to be louder    out here too. Just the crickets and  ""Oh My God""!",10,15
monica,"Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's still going to show up wherever    we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of surprise.    I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls    jump back up inside your body.",10,15
chandler,"Well, we    have to do something. We can't have her living next door.  Oh, that does it too.",10,15
r zelner,Who is it?,10,15
ross,"It's me. Ron.     Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might    be able to get her to come back.",10,15
mr zelner,"This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees,    is not my main job.",10,15
ross,Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?,10,15
mr zelner,"Not good, Ron.",10,15
ross,Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica.,10,15
mr zelner,"Wow, that is    pretty cool",10,15
ross,Huh? So? We have a deal?,10,15
mr zelner,"Okay, you got it.",10,15
ross,Yes! yes!,10,15
mr zelner,This is going to make me very popular.,10,15
ross,"Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it!",10,15
mr zelner,I meant with my son.,10,15
ross,"Good, Because the ladies, not so much.",10,15
joey,Oh my God.  Hello?,10,15
phoebe,"Joey,    it's Estelle.",10,15
joey,Estelle?,10,15
phoebe,"Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for    firing me.",10,15
joey,"Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you are calling me?",10,15
phoebe,"Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...",10,15
joey,"No, no, no!  Don't drop by,    don't drop by!",10,15
phoebe,"Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.",10,15
joey,"Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?",10,15
phoebe,"It's alright. Look kiddo, I got to go. Good luck with    the career. you are going to be huge.",10,15
joey,"Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye.     ""out of area"". Boy, I'll say.",10,15
chandler,The Hitlers will be so disappointed.,10,15
janice,"All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see    you later, neighbour.",10,15
chandler,Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you are going to    be here.,10,15
janice,"Oh, me too...",10,15
chandler,Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.,10,15
janice,Huh?,10,15
chandler,I never stopped loving you.,10,15
janice,Oh... my...,10,15
chandler,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice    Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.",10,15
janice,"Chandler, what are you talking about?",10,15
chandler,"Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and    Monica never have to know a thing.",10,15
janice,"I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this...    heat between us.",10,15
chandler,Obviously.,10,15
janice,"But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't    think we should get this house now.",10,15
chandler,Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.,10,15
janice,"Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.",10,15
chandler,I understand.,10,15
janice,"Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness...  Goodbye Chandler Bing.",10,15
chandler,They're never coming down now.,10,15
rachel,Hi!,10,15
ross,Hey!,10,15
rachel,You are never going to believe what happened to me today.,10,15
ross,What?,10,15
rachel,Ralph Lauren called again and they offered    me more money.,10,15
ross,They did?,10,15
rachel,Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll    do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I    don't even know what department that guy's in.,10,15
ross,"So, what are you going to do?",10,15
rachel,"Well, I took it.",10,15
ross,that is great! So you are staying in New York!,10,15
both,YAY! WHOO! YAY!,10,15
ross,"you are excited, right?",10,15
rachel,"Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great.    It's certainly the easier choice...",10,15
ross,Right!,10,15
rachel,"Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to    Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital    of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's    fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of    that I possibly can...",10,15
ross,"Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.    Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.",10,15
rachel,"Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when    I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-going to-have-Emma scared...    But this is... fine. This is going to be good.",10,15
ross,You should go.,10,15
rachel,What?,10,15
ross,It's what you want. You should go.,10,15
rachel,You really think so?,10,15
ross,I really do.,10,15
rachel,But I already told Zelner that I would come back...,10,15
ross,I'm sure he'll    understand.,10,15
rachel,All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm going to do it. I'm going to go to Paris.,10,15
ross,Yeah...,10,15
rachel,"Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!",10,15
ross,"Yeah, yeah, oh!",10,15
rachel,"Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.",10,15
ross,Then I'm happy too.,10,15
joey,"Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects    to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman...     ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words.  Dude, where's    my speech?  That is    entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody.",10,15
joey,"All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.",10,16
rachel,"Ok! Can't believe I'm risking  this again, but you are on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.",10,16
joey,Just flip!,10,16
rachel,"Ha, tails!",10,16
joey,Damnit!,10,16
chandler,Hey!,10,16
joey,Hey!,10,16
chandler,So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.,10,16
rachel,"Oh, that sounds good!",10,16
monica,"Hey, Rach, you are leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?",10,16
rachel,It's all done!,10,16
monica,"Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.",10,16
rachel,"I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that is the sandwich that I made for the plane...",10,16
monica,"Ok,  so you've done some good work!  What about your carry-ons?",10,16
rachel,"Oh, well. Everything that I need  is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.",10,16
monica,Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!,10,16
chandler,Where's your passport?,10,16
rachel,It should be right next to my plane ticket.,10,16
chandler,"Well, it's not.",10,16
rachel,"What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!",10,16
monica,"Here, let me help you.",10,16
rachel,"Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!",10,16
chandler,At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport?,10,16
monica,"Oh, wow, can you believe you are like three weeks away?",10,16
erica,I know.,10,16
monica,"You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?",10,16
erica,"No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is going to come out.",10,16
ross,Hey!,10,16
erica,Hi.,10,16
ross,"Hey Erica, welcome back to town!  Wow, look how big you've gotten.",10,16
erica,that is because I'm pregnant!,10,16
ross,"Right, no, I understand.",10,16
erica,"Oh, ok.  I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.",10,16
ross,"No, no, I knew .",10,16
monica,"Okay, well, stop staring at them.",10,16
ross,She brought them up!  I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!,10,16
erica,"Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.",10,16
monica,"Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.",10,16
ross,Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?,10,16
monica,Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.,10,16
erica,Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!,10,16
ross,"Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...",10,16
monica,Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.,10,16
erica,I'll be right back.,10,16
ross,"Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.",10,16
monica,"Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.",10,16
ross,"No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost  to feed Joey?",10,16
monica,"Yeah, it takes two incomes.",10,16
ross,"Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.",10,16
monica,"Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.",10,16
ross,"Mhm,  packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.",10,16
monica,"Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.",10,16
ross,What are you guys doing?,10,16
joey,"Try it, I can't feel a thing!",10,16
monica,"Are, are you kidding? This is packing?",10,16
chandler,We're taking a break!,10,16
monica,From?,10,16
chandler,Jumping on the bed?,10,16
monica,"All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you are in charge of these yahoos!",10,16
ross,"You got it! . All right, she's right, we got to get serious.  Let's put Styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!",10,16
chandler,"No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack them and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.",10,16
joey,You guys hear a ringing?,10,16
chandler,What the hell is this?,10,16
joey,"Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in you!",10,16
ross,"Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.",10,16
chandler,I didn't know Monica had these!,10,16
joey,"Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!",10,16
chandler,Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!,10,16
ross,"Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.",10,16
phoebe,Hey!,10,16
monica,Hey! Where's Mike?,10,16
phoebe,"Oh, he has a gig. I kind of like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.",10,16
ross,"Yeah? Yeah, where is it?",10,16
phoebe,"Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.",10,16
ross,Rock on!,10,16
phoebe,"Wow, this is quite a spread!  What is all this stuff?",10,16
monica,"Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy",10,16
joey,Hey.,10,16
chandler,Hey.,10,16
ross,"Hey, where's Rach?",10,16
joey,"Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.",10,16
ross,Great.,10,16
joey,"Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?",10,16
monica,Yeah.,10,16
everybody,"Hey Rach, hey you.",10,16
ross,Here she is!,10,16
rachel,Hi you guys!,10,16
joey,What did I just say?,10,16
rachel,"No, no, no. It's ok. I'm going to be fine.",10,16
monica,"Come here, I'll make you a drink.",10,16
ross,"Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I going to say goodbye to Rachel?",10,16
chandler,"I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.  I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!",10,16
joey,"You know, I had a chance to stop her too!",10,16
ross,Yeah?,10,16
joey,"Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose.  Wait a minute...",10,16
chandler,"Yes, Joe?",10,16
joey,I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!,10,16
phoebe,You doing ok?,10,16
rachel,"Well, I've been better.",10,16
phoebe,Uh-hmm.,10,16
rachel,"You guys are going to come and visit me, right?",10,16
phoebe,"Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!",10,16
rachel,I'm going to miss you so much.,10,16
phoebe,I know.,10,16
rachel,"You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was going to save it until the end of the night, but come here .",10,16
ross,"Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?",10,16
joey,"Huh, if I had to  guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.",10,16
rachel,"Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.",10,16
phoebe,"Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,   but I do have something for you.",10,16
rachel,"Oh, oh. . What is this?",10,16
phoebe,"It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!",10,16
rachel,"I'm going to throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!",10,16
monica,Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these  on my pillow.,10,16
chandler,"Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you want to  engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!",10,16
monica,What are you talking about? These aren't mine.,10,16
chandler,"Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from  me!",10,16
monica,"That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.",10,16
chandler,Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?,10,16
monica,Rachel used to live in that room.,10,16
chandler,Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!,10,16
monica,Joey's bare ass!,10,16
chandler,. Well played.,10,16
rachel,I love you Phoebe.,10,16
phoebe,I love you too.  Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!,10,16
rachel,"All right. Well, if I going to do this, I'd better keep going.",10,16
phoebe,Ok.,10,16
rachel,Ok. Monica?,10,16
monica,Yeah?,10,16
rachel,Can you come here with me for a minute?,10,16
monica,Sure.,10,16
phoebe,Are you wearing waterproof mascara?,10,16
monica,No.,10,16
phoebe,"Oh, you are so screwed.",10,16
ross,Hey. What was that all about?,10,16
phoebe,She's going to say goodbye to each of us individually.,10,16
ross,Are you kidding? Oh my God...,10,16
phoebe,"Yeah, I know, it's going to be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.",10,16
ross,"Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this.  Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.",10,16
rachel,"Mon... Okay... I've got to... just say what it is I'm going to say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...",10,16
monica,I know what you mean. you are like a sister to me too.,10,16
rachel,I wouldn't know what I'm going to do without you...,10,16
monica,you are the best friend I ever had.,10,16
rachel,,10,16
monica,What?,10,16
rachel,I... I... I...,10,16
monica,That is so sweet.,10,16
ross,"Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.",10,16
chandler,"Uh, Rach?",10,16
ross,Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.,10,16
joey,I really made you think about that thing uh?,10,16
chandler,"Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.",10,16
rachel,"Oh, I'm sure going to miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.",10,16
chandler,"No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.",10,16
rachel,"Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...",10,16
chandler,"Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?",10,16
rachel,"Well, I think you are forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.",10,16
chandler,Pheebs!,10,16
phoebe,Yeah!,10,16
chandler,I think these are yours.,10,16
phoebe,"These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.",10,16
rachel,Can I talk to you alone for a minute?,10,16
chandler,Sure.  You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?,10,16
phoebe,Where do you think Mike really is?,10,16
rachel,Oh honey...,10,16
chandler,"Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm going to get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm going to miss you. And I'm so sad that you are leaving.",10,16
rachel,"Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.",10,16
chandler,"Ooh, not so tight...  I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.",10,16
rachel,Okay. Oh...,10,16
rachel,Oh!,10,16
chandler,"I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.",10,16
monica,"So, I guess you are next. you are ready?",10,16
ross,I don't think so.,10,16
chandler,"Oh, you are definitely not. I haven't cried like that in years.",10,16
monica,You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.,10,16
chandler,That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.,10,16
ross,God! I can't believe she saved me for last.  Why are they taking so long?,10,16
phoebe,"I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it surprisingly well.",10,16
all,"No, no, no, no!",10,16
ross,"Okay, here we go...",10,16
rachel,Oh...  Well...,10,16
ross,Yeah...,10,16
rachel,I think I'm going to take off.,10,16
ross,Huh?,10,16
rachel,"Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.",10,16
ross,What? I don't get a goodbye?,10,16
joey,Lucky bastard!,10,16
ross,Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.,10,16
monica,"Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.",10,16
ross,"Well, it needs to be plicit.",10,16
joey,"All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?",10,16
ross,"No, I don't think so.",10,16
phoebe,"You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.",10,16
monica,Yeah. Mine too.,10,16
chandler,Mine was a humdinger,10,16
ross,"O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?  NOT FROM YOU!",10,16
phoebe,"Ross, if you are this upset, you should go and talk to her.",10,16
monica,"And say what? ""You owe me a goodbye"", I mean, he's got more pride than that.",10,16
ross,THE HELL I DO!,10,16
ross,I don't get a goodbye?,10,16
rachel,What?,10,16
ross,"Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.",10,16
rachel,Ross...,10,16
ross,"Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good...  IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.",10,16
monica,I hope Ross isn't too upset.,10,16
joey,I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.,10,16
phoebe,Tell me about it.,10,16
chandler,"Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.",10,16
phoebe,"All right, I think I'm going to head out.",10,16
monica,"Uh, where do you think you are going?",10,16
phoebe,"I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.",10,16
monica,We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.,10,16
chandler,Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.,10,16
joey,"Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.",10,16
monica,Oh no! You and Phoebe are going to help me in here.,10,16
chandler,You couldn't be cool.,10,16
monica,"Okay, we're going to start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?",10,16
phoebe and joey,Yeah.,10,16
monica,"Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.",10,16
chandler,"Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.",10,16
monica,You did? How?,10,16
chandler,"Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.",10,16
monica,Oh my God! Let me see.,10,16
joey,Who's that dirty old lady?,10,16
chandler,Monica's grandmother.,10,16
monica,Nana liked it rough!,10,16
erica,Hi!,10,16
all,Hey!,10,16
joey,"Come on here, have a seat.",10,16
phoebe,How was your night?,10,16
erica,"Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh...  Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.",10,16
monica,"Erica, are you okay?",10,16
erica,"Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.",10,16
monica,Oh my God!,10,16
chandler,Relax! We just get her some antacids.,10,16
monica,"She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labour.",10,16
chandler,Oh my God!,10,16
phoebe,"Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.",10,16
monica,"All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're going to have a baby. All right. We're going to have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE going to HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!",10,16
chandler,"Honey, it's going to be okay.",10,16
erica,You can do this. Just breathe.,10,16
monica,"Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.",10,16
erica,Ooh! Are you sure?,10,16
monica,"Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.",10,16
joey,"Chandler, wait, wait, wait...",10,16
chandler,What?,10,16
joey,"If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.",10,16
rachel,You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?,10,16
ross,that is what it seemed like.,10,16
rachel,"I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.",10,16
ross,"Fine, then why didn't you say something?",10,16
rachel,"Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm going to miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you are wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!",10,16
ross,Rach!,10,16
rachel,What?,10,16
ross,"You keep, you keep... You can't...",10,16
rachel,WHAT?,10,16
joey,A little more.,10,16
phoebe,Okay.,10,16
joey,"A little more, a little more.  A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.",10,16
phoebe,"All right, ready?",10,16
joey,"Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.",10,16
phoebe,"All right, here it goes...",10,16
joey,Doesn't work...,10,16
jennifer aniston,Previously on Friends.,10,17
monica,"Erica, are you okay?",10,17
erica,"Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these    stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.",10,17
monica,Oh my God!,10,17
chandler,Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.,10,17
monica,She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labour!,10,17
chandler,Oh my God!,10,17
rachel,"So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't    mean as much to me as everybody else, you are wrong. It's because you    mean more to me.",10,17
ross,Rach!,10,17
rachel,What?!,10,17
ross,Hey.,10,17
rachel,Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.,10,17
ross,Oh. This was amazing.,10,17
rachel,It really was. You've learned some new moves!,10,17
ross,"Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me ""Sex for Dummies"" as a    joke.",10,17
rachel,Ah.,10,17
ross,Who's laughing now?,10,17
rachel,I know!,10,17
monica,"Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.",10,17
chandler,"Next time, can I say breathe?",10,17
monica,"No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can    I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?",10,17
erica,"No, I'm okay.",10,17
monica,"Alright, I'll be right back.",10,17
chandler,Where are you going?,10,17
monica,To use the bathroom.,10,17
chandler,You can't leave me alone with her.,10,17
monica,What?,10,17
chandler,This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not    comfortable with!,10,17
monica,What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?,10,17
chandler,"It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone    together.",10,17
monica,"You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two    minutes.",10,17
chandler,Okay.,10,17
chandler,"So, ah... Any plans for the summer?",10,17
erica,I don't know. Maybe church-camp?,10,17
chandler,"Hah. May not want to mention this. So, you ever wonder which    is worse, you know; going through labour or getting kicked in the nuts?",10,17
erica,What?,10,17
chandler,"Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will    ever know, because no one can experience both.",10,17
chandler,"One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who    knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things?  Like this.",10,17
phoebe,Morning.,10,17
joey,Hey!,10,17
phoebe,What's that?,10,17
joey,It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.,10,17
phoebe,It's a baby chick and duck!,10,17
joey,Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.,10,17
phoebe,I did not see that coming.,10,17
joey,"Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It    has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to    that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.",10,17
phoebe,Yes.,10,17
joey,Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.,10,17
phoebe,"That is the rule, though.",10,17
phoebe,Guess what? you are almost an uncle!,10,17
ross,What?,10,17
joey,"Yeah, Erica went into labour last night. Monica and Chandler are    at the hospital right now!",10,17
ross,Oh my God!,10,17
phoebe,"Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's going to be a girl.",10,17
ross,"Phoebe, you were sure Ben was going to be a girl.",10,17
phoebe,Have you seen him throw a ball?,10,17
ross,Is Rachel here?,10,17
joey,"Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you    guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.",10,17
ross,"Uh, we, you know, we worked things out.",10,17
phoebe,What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?,10,17
ross,"Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have    sex and shut up. We totally did it!",10,17
joey,Oh my God. You and Rachel?,10,17
ross,"I know, it's pretty great.",10,17
joey,So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?,10,17
ross,"Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.",10,17
phoebe,But do you want to get back together?,10,17
ross,"I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right.    When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know    what? Yeah, I do. I want to be together.",10,17
phoebe,YAY!,10,17
ross,Shh!,10,17
phoebe,Yay!,10,17
joey,"So, so is she still going to Paris?",10,17
ross,"Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.",10,17
phoebe,"Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get    back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are    chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical!     ""Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And    the moon comes...""",10,17
rachel,Morning!,10,17
phoebe,Guess we'll never know how it ends.,10,17
joey,Okay.,10,17

rachel,Hey.,10,17
ross,Hey. How did you sleep?,10,17
rachel,Good. You?,10,17
ross,Good.,10,17
joey,I bet you did!,10,17
ross,Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?,10,17
joey,"Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?",10,17
rachel,Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...,10,17
phoebe,"Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on    the farm.",10,17
ross,So...,10,17
ross,Morning.,10,17
rachel,You too. Last night was just wonderful.,10,17
ross,It really was.,10,17
rachel,I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.,10,17
ross,"I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those    things you think is never going to happen, and then it does, and it's    everything you want it to be.",10,17
rachel,"Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.",10,17
monica,"It's just a little bit more, honey.",10,17
erica,Help me! This hurts!,10,17
chandler,Is it really that bad?,10,17
erica,Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which    is worse!,10,17
doctor,The baby's head is crowning.,10,17
monica,"Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have    ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!",10,17
chandler,I'm okay.,10,17
monica,"Chandler, you don't want to miss this. This is the birth of your    child! It's the miracle of life!",10,17
chandler,"Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.",10,17
doctor,Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...,10,17
monica,It's a... It's a boy!,10,17
chandler,Wow!,10,17
erica,Is he okay?,10,17
doctor,He's just fine.,10,17
monica,"Oh, you did it!",10,17
chandler,It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some   other stuff I'm going to pretend I don't see.,10,17
doctor,Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?,10,17
chandler,"Well, that is spongy.",10,17
monica,"Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm going to love you so much   that no woman is ever going to be good enough for you!  Oh, we are so lucky!",10,17
chandler,I know. He has your eyes.,10,17
chandler,"I mean, I know that is not possible, but he does.",10,17
nurse,We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.,10,17
chandler,Okay.,10,17
monica,"Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.",10,17
erica,I'm really happy for you guys.,10,17
chandler,How do you feel?,10,17
erica,I'm tired!,10,17
doctor,"Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one    will be along in a minute.",10,17
monica,"I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?",10,17
doctor,The next baby should be along in a minute.,10,17
monica,We only ordered one!,10,17
doctor,"You know it's twins, right?",10,17
chandler,"Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!",10,17
doctor,I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never    happened before.,10,17
chandler,"Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.",10,17
monica,"Wait, did you know it was twins?",10,17
doctor,"Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in    Ohio.",10,17
monica,Anybody tell you?,10,17
erica,"I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about    two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They    kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well,    that is good Because I'm having a baby.",10,17
monica,This is unbelievable.,10,17
erica,Twins actually run in my family.,10,17
chandler,Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?,10,17
chandler,What do we do?,10,17
monica,"What do you mean ""what do we do""?",10,17
chandler,Twins! Twins!!,10,17
monica,"Chandler, you are panicking!",10,17
chandler,"Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep   one, and then just like have an option on the other one?",10,17
monica,We can't split them up!,10,17
chandler,"Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and    then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean,    that is a great day for everybody.",10,17
monica,"Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?",10,17
chandler,What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?,10,17
monica,"Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.",10,17
chandler,"Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!",10,17
monica,"That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't    care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't    care if the entire cast of ""Eight is Enough"" comes out of there! We    are taking them home, because they are our children!",10,17
chandler,Okay. Shh...,10,17
chandler,Okay.,10,17
monica,Okay!,10,17
chandler,Okay!,10,17
doctor,It looks like we're about ready over here.,10,17
doctor,"Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.",10,17
erica,Ow!,10,17
doctor,Here she comes!,10,17
chandler,She? It's a girl?,10,17
doctor,Yeah.,10,17
chandler,"Well, now we have one of each!     And that is enough!",10,17
ross,And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.,10,17
joey,Oh my God! What did you say?,10,17
ross,Nothing! What do you say to that?,10,17
phoebe,"Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!",10,17
ross,No way!,10,17
joey,You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?,10,17
ross,What?,10,17
joey,"Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.",10,17
phoebe,"Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you want to get back together. If    she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.",10,17
ross,You really think so?,10,17
phoebe,"I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical    where there'd be a really good convincing song.  ""Bam-bam,    don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away.    Bam-bam-bam-bam...""",10,17
rachel,Hi!,10,17
phoebe,Can't a girl finish a song around here?,10,17
joey,Hey!,10,17
rachel,Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.,10,17
ross,Okay.,10,17
joey,"Oh, you are not taking her with you tonight?",10,17
rachel,"No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and    then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.",10,17
phoebe,"Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.",10,17
rachel,"Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about    Atkins? Good luck, Emma!",10,17
ross,"Alright, you know what? you are right. I should at least tell her   how I feel.",10,17
joey,"Ross, wait!",10,17
ross,What? What?,10,17
joey,Could you get me a muffin?,10,17
gunther,Rachel?,10,17
rachel,Yeah?,10,17
gunther,"I... I know you are leaving tonight, but I just have to tell   you. I love you.",10,17
gunther,"I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I   thought you should know.",10,17
rachel,"Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the   same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a cafe, having coffee, or I   see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.",10,17
rachel,Oh... Bye guys.,10,17
ross,Oh my God!,10,17
phoebe,Unbelievable!,10,17
joey,"Hey, you know what might help?",10,17
ross,I'm not getting you a muffin!,10,17
monica,Do you think they recognize each other from in there?,10,17
chandler,"Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in    apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're    pushed through a vagina and they meet.",10,17
nurse,We're going to take Erica to recovery now.,10,17
monica,There's something that we want to tell you. We decided to name    the girl-baby Erica.,10,17
erica,"Oh my God, that is just like my name!",10,17
monica,"Son of a gun, it is!",10,17
erica,"Anyway, I'm going to go and get some rest. I'm really glad I    picked you guys. you are going to make great parents. Even Chandler.",10,17
monica,"Okay, well, bye!",10,17
erica,Bye!,10,17
chandler,Bye!,10,17
monica,We'll call you!,10,17
erica,Okay.,10,17
chandler,Have fun at church-camp!,10,17
monica,"Oh, look at these little bunnies!",10,17
chandler,I know! You ready to trade?,10,17
monica,Okay.,10,17
chandler,Okay.,10,17
monica,"Alright, let's see..",10,17
chandler,We could trade later.,10,17
monica,"Yeah, I'm good.",10,17
phoebe,"Hey, what are you working on?",10,17
joey,"It's a... It's a ""welcome home"" sign for the baby.",10,17
phoebe,"How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?",10,17
joey,"No, I sat in the paint.",10,17
ross,Hey.,10,17
phoebe,"Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?",10,17
ross,"No, and I'm not going to.",10,17
phoebe,What?,10,17
joey,Why not?,10,17
ross,Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what    happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.,10,17
phoebe,"How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's    sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you    slept together last night.",10,17
ross,"Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.",10,17
joey,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...",10,17
phoebe,"Uh, Joe?",10,17
joey,Damn it!,10,17
ross,"Look, even if I were going to tell her, I don't have to do it now.    Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.",10,17
phoebe,"No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet    somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's...    It's a city of Gunther's!",10,17
mike,Hey!,10,17
phoebe,Hey! What do you have there?,10,17
mike,"Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it,    it'd be better, but..",10,17
ross,Oh my God! You did that yourself?,10,17
phoebe,"Honey, that is gorgeous!",10,17
joey,"You know, the baby can't read, Mike!",10,17
rachel,"Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe   they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I want to see the   baby!",10,17
joey,"Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here   any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.",10,17
phoebe,"Yeah, did she sound happy about it? Because my friend Ethel's   baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.",10,17
rachel,Oh my God!,10,17
ross,Oh my God!,10,17
rachel,Hi! Oh my gosh!,10,17
chandler,Hey.,10,17
"phoebe, ross, rachel",Hey.,10,17
joey,"Hey, so what is the big surprise?",10,17
rachel,Oh.,10,17
ross,Oh my God!,10,17
rachel,What... What...,10,17
ross,"Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two,    right?",10,17
monica,"Yes, it's twins!",10,17
ross,Oh my God.,10,17
joey,"Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?",10,17
monica,"This is a boy,  and that is a girl.",10,17
chandler,Her name is Erica.,10,17
rachel,Aw..,10,17
joey,"Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.",10,17
chandler,Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time   together.,10,17
monica,"Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.",10,17
ross,"Aw, he's going to be so happy.",10,17
phoebe,"Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s   newspaper guy, you know? ""Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm going to blow   this story wide open!""",10,17
rachel,"Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.",10,17
mike,I want one.,10,17
phoebe,"Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my   coat.",10,17
mike,Seriously. want to make one of those?,10,17
phoebe,One? How about a whole bunch?,10,17
mike,Really?,10,17
phoebe,"Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the   Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kind of   dull.",10,17
rachel,"Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm   going to miss my plane.",10,17
monica,I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.,10,17
rachel,"Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not going to be around to watch   you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you   guys again. I love you all so much.",10,17
monica,I love you.,10,17
chandler,I love you.,10,17
monica,Call us when you get there.,10,17
rachel,"I will. Ross, come here.",10,17
rachel,I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.,10,17
ross,Neither will I.,10,17
rachel,"Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're    going to really hate me over there.",10,17
phoebe,"So, you just let her go?",10,17
ross,Yeah.,10,17
joey,"Hey, maybe that is for the best.",10,17
ross,Yeah?,10,17
joey,"Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you got to... You got to think    about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping    together was the perfect way to say goodbye?",10,17
phoebe,But now she'll never know how he feels!,10,17
joey,"Maybe that is okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way?    I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so   long, maybe now that you are on different continents..  Right?",10,17
joey,Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get   over her.,10,17
ross,"Yeah, that is true. Except I don't want to get over her.",10,17
joey,What?,10,17
ross,I don't! I want to be with her.,10,17
joey,Really?,10,17
ross,"Yeah, I'm going to go after her.",10,17

ross,My coat...,10,17
joey,This is so cool!,10,17
chandler,"I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!",10,17
joey,"But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to   say?",10,17
ross,"I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least   I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened.   Where - where is my coat?!",10,17
phoebe,"You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to   the airport.",10,17
ross,"Okay, guys, wish me luck.",10,17
phoebe,Hurry!,10,17
joey,"Good luck, good luck!",10,17
ross,There's no seatbelt!,10,17
phoebe,"that is okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode,    so you know, it's better if you are thrown from the car.",10,17
ross,"Alright, alright, let's do this!",10,17
phoebe,Okay!,10,17
ross,Hey!,10,17
man,18th and East End.,10,17
phoebe,I - I don't take passengers.,10,17
man,Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.,10,17
ross,"No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.",10,17
man,"Alright, I got to report you. What's your medallion number?",10,17
phoebe,"My medallion number is, ""Get out of the cab!""",10,17
man,What?,10,17
ross,Get out of the cab!,10,17
phoebe,Get out of the cab!,10,17
joey,"Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present    now?",10,17

joey,Alright!,10,17
joey,Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!,10,17
phoebe,You can open your eyes now.,10,17
ross,Are we off the bridge?,10,17
phoebe,Yes.,10,17
ross,Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?,10,17
phoebe,"Yes, she jumped right back up.",10,17
ross,"Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!",10,17
phoebe,Do you want to get to Rachel in time?,10,17
ross,"Yes, but I don't want to die in your cab!",10,17
phoebe,You should have thought of that before you got in!,10,17
phoebe,Toll-booth.,10,17
ross,What?,10,17
phoebe,Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the    glove compartment.,10,17
phoebe,Hurry!,10,17
ross,Okay!,10,17
phoebe,Okay.,10,17
phoebe,"Damn, that window is clean.",10,17
joey,"Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack,   quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...",10,17
chandler,"We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but   now we understand you were doing this.",10,17
joey,"Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift,   I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!",10,17
chandler,Really? You got us a chick and a duck?,10,17
monica,"Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants.   Bird feces.",10,17
joey,"Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, Because now   they're gone!",10,17
chandler,"Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.",10,17
monica,"Actually, I'm going to go check on the twins.",10,17
chandler,Alright.,10,17
monica,Oh God! What did I just step on?,10,17
joey,Oh!,10,17
chandler,"It's okay, it's just an egg roll.",10,17
monica,Oh..,10,17
joey,You stepped on my egg roll?,10,17
monica,"I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the    floor.",10,17
joey,Just put it on a plate and leave.,10,17
chandler,"Okay, let's find these birds.",10,17
joey,Alright.,10,17
joey,"Wait, wait. Do you hear that?",10,17
joey,Oh! They're in the table!,10,17
chandler,"Well, that can't be good!",10,17
joey,We got to get them out of there!,10,17
chandler,How?,10,17
joey,"Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?",10,17
chandler,"Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.",10,17
joey,"Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.",10,17
chandler,"Joey, wait! The ball!",10,17
joey,Oh!,10,17
joey,Oh God! So what do we do?,10,17
chandler,I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.,10,17
joey,Okay.,10,17
chandler,No... It's all glued together.,10,17
joey,Does that mean we have to bust it open?,10,17
chandler,I don't know. Maybe.,10,17
joey,Oh my God!,10,17
chandler,I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.,10,17
joey,"All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would    have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. ""Those are our    men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the    most important thing in my life; my time-machine.""",10,17
chandler,Did that movie ever get made?,10,17
joey,It did not.,10,17
phoebe,"Ross, where are you going?",10,17
ross,"To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the    death-cab?",10,17
phoebe,What? What are you just going to walk up to her at the gate? Have    you never chased anyone through the airport before?,10,17
ross,Not since my cop-show got cancelled.,10,17
phoebe,You have to get a ticket to get past security.,10,17
ross,What? We're never going to make it!,10,17
phoebe,"Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!",10,17
ross,"Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.",10,17
gate attendant #1,"Madame, your passport    please?",10,17
rachel,"Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't going to remember any of my    high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!",10,17
gate attendant #1,"Your boarding pass, please.",10,17
rachel,Oh.,10,17
rachel,"Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.",10,17
gate attendant #1,"Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...",10,17
rachel,"I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it,    but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that is my bra-size.",10,17
gate attendant #1,"Madame, you must have your boarding pass..",10,17
rachel,"Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not  be having this problem.",10,17
ross,"Hey, I need a ticket.",10,17
phoebe,"Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get    to see how it works out?",10,17
ross,"Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.",10,17
phoebe,We're on our honeymoon.,10,17
ticket agent,And the destination?,10,17
ross,I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.,10,17
phoebe,I'm so lucky I married you.,10,17
rachel,Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found    it!,10,17
rachel,Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face!  you are a different person.,10,17
ross,"Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?",10,17
phoebe,"No, did we miss it?",10,17
ross,"No, no, no. that is impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20    minutes.",10,17
phoebe,Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.,10,17
monica,Hello.,10,17
phoebe,"Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.",10,17
ross,"What? Hey, hey, listen..",10,17
monica,"Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises    the twins are making. Listen.",10,17
ross,"Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?",10,17
monica,"Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.",10,17
ross,"that is alright. Listen, listen.",10,17
monica,"Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.",10,17
ross,"Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?",10,17
monica,Isn't that cute?,10,17
ross,That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.,10,17
monica,"Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8",10,17
ross,"Yes, that is what I have. It's not on the board.",10,17
monica,"that is what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8",10,17
ross,What?,10,17
monica,"Newark airport. Why, where are you?",10,17
ross,JFK.,10,17
joey,"Don't worry, you guys, we're going to get you out of    there.",10,17
chandler,"And we're also going to buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.",10,17
joey,Okay. Here goes.,10,17
chandler,What's the matter?,10,17
joey,I need to say goodbye to the table first.,10,17
chandler,I understand.,10,17
joey,"Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you    guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You    guys make us look good. You want to say anything?",10,17
chandler,"I don't know. Except that, for one last time...  Good game, good game, good game,    good game, good game, good game, good game.",10,17
joey,"Okay, here we go. I can't do it.",10,17
chandler,"Well, I can't do it either.",10,17
monica,Hey! Did you find them?,10,17
joey,"Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!",10,17
chandler,"We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!",10,17
monica,"Oh, well sure. This got to be so hard. I'll do it. give me!",10,17
ross,"Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!",10,17
phoebe,"Well, I've never gone this fast before.",10,17
ross,"Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away.    There's no way we're going to make it in time.",10,17
phoebe,"She's got her cell, you could call her.",10,17
ross,I am not doing this over the phone.,10,17
phoebe,You don't have any other choice!,10,17
rachel,Hello?,10,17
phoebe,"Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the    plane?",10,17
rachel,Yeah.,10,17
phoebe,"For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.",10,17
ross,Yay.,10,17
phoebe,"Uh, Rach, hang on.",10,17
rachel,Phoebe? Is everything okay?,10,17
phoebe,"Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.",10,17
rachel,What? Why?,10,17
phoebe,I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something    is wrong with the left Phalange.,10,17
rachel,"Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.",10,17
rachel,"Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you    the minute I get to Paris.",10,17
passenger #1,"Uhm, what was that?",10,17
rachel,"Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get    off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something    wrong with the left Phalange.",10,17
passenger #1,"Okay, that doesn't sound good.",10,17
rachel,"I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff    like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.",10,17
passenger #1,But she is sometimes.,10,17
rachel,Well...,10,17
rachel,"Wait, what are you doing?",10,17
passenger #1,"Well, I can't take this plane now.",10,17
air stewardess,"Excuse me, sir, where are you going?",10,17
passenger #1,"I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a    feeling something's wrong with the left Phalange.",10,17
rachel,Could I get some peanuts?,10,17
passenger #2,What's wrong with the plane?,10,17
air stewardess,There's nothing wrong with the plane.,10,17
passenger #1,Yeah! The left Phalange!,10,17
air stewardess,There is no Phalange!,10,17
passenger #1,Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Phalange!,10,17
passenger #2,I'm not flying on it!,10,17
air stewardess,"Ma'am, please sit down!",10,17
passenger #3,What's going on?,10,17
passenger #1,We're all getting off. There is no Phalange!,10,17
rachel,This is ridiculous! I...,10,17
rachel,"Yeah, okay.",10,17
monica,Alright. My job here is done.,10,17
chandler,That was... Impressive.,10,17
joey,"Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!",10,17
monica,"Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get    back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.",10,17
chandler,"Sorry about the table, man.",10,17
joey,Yeah.,10,17
chandler,You going to buy a new one?,10,17
joey,Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm going to want to play    after you go.,10,17
chandler,"Well, at least we got these little guys out.",10,17
joey,Yeah.,10,17
chandler,"Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get    used to things crapping in my hand, huh?",10,17
joey,I'm going to miss these little guys. It was nice having birds    around again.,10,17
chandler,"Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.",10,17
joey,What?,10,17
chandler,"Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus,    here they'd have their own room.",10,17
joey,I could get a goose!,10,17
